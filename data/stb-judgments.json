The Applicants are the subsidiary proprietors of  911 Lorong 1 Toa Payoh, Singapore 319771  \n(\u201cthe Applicants \u201d) of a strata  development known as Oleander Towers (\u201cthe \nDevelopment \u201d). The Respondent is the Management Corporation Strata  Title P lan No. 2 245 \nof the Development (\u201c the Respondent \u201d). \n \n2. This is yet another dispute on the right of the subsidiary proprietors living on the ground \nfloor to fix awnings over their private outdoor spaces which has come before the Board in 1) Foo Siang Yean 2) Leong Fong Meng Irene     STB No. 109 of 202 2 \u2013 Oleander Towers   \n3) Tay Kheng Lock and Lim Hai Imm Doris vs  \n     the MCST Plan No. 2245  \n                               \n \n3 \n the last five years. Most of the cases involved situations where the subsidiary proprietors of \nground floor units would report to the management corporation that they are facing a killer \nlitter problem. Usually, this involves evidence of dangerous items falling into the ground  \nfloor units. In some cases, police reports are lodged. As a response to the killer litter problem, \nthe ground floor  subsidiary proprietors  would seek the management corporation\u2019s \npermission to install awnings as protective coverings against killer litter.  These features are \nalso found in the present case.  Thus, the legal issue is whether an individual owner has a \nright to fix awnings on his or her own unit as  a form of  protective covering from killer litter \nwithout obtaining the requisite consent from the rest of the owners.  \n \n3. To understand the difficulty with obtaining consent, some context is necessary. Singapore\u2019s \nstrata law stipulates that to make a by -law granting exclusive use of common property for \nmore than 3 years to an owner of a lot, a 90 % resolu tion is required from all subsidiary \nproprietors present (in person or by proxy) at a meeting when the vote is taken (see section \n33(1)(c) of the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act 2004 (\u201cBMSMA\u201d). In \n2018, Chan Seng Onn J in Wu Chiu Lin v Manag ement Corporation Strata Title Plan No \n2874  [2018] 4 SLR 966 decided that external walls of buildings were common property even \nif these external walls were comprised in an individual owner\u2019s apartment; hence, the court \nheld that a structure which was atta ched to an external wall constituted exclusive use and \nrequired a 90 % resolution. The correctness of this decision has not been seriously \nchallenged and it has been assumed that since awnings are attached to external walls, such \nstructures must be authori sed with a 90 % resolution  (see also the decision of Ang Cheng \nHock J in Mu Qi and another v Management Corporation Strata Plan No 1849  [2021] 5 \nSLR 1401 at [60]; Ahmad bin Ibrahim v Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No. \n4131 [2018] SGSTB 8) . A comp eting characterisation is to take a purposive approach to the \nstatute and regard the fixing of an awning to the external wall does not constitute exclusive \nuse of the external wall but should instead be construed as a form of alteration to common \nproperty.  In fact, the New South Wales Civil and Administrative Tribunal has recently \nsuggested that anchoring an awning to an external wall is not a form of alteration to the \ncommon property other than incidentally ( Fong v The Owners Strata Plan No 82783  [2022] \nNSWCATCD 56 at [104]). Alterations to common property would require only a special \nresolution i.e. 75 % of all owners present at (in person or by proxy) at a meeting when the \nvote is taken. While this development in New South Wales is interesting, this Board  is bound \nby the decision s of the Singapore High Court  (Wu Chiu Lin v Management Corporation \nStrata Title Plan No 2874  [2018] 4 SLR 966; Mu Qi and another v Management Corporation \nStrata Title Plan No 1849  [2021] 5 SLR 1401 at [60])  and for the purposes of this action it \nis assumed  that a 90% resolution is required to fix awnings on the wall.  \n \n4. Most of the cases demonstrate that when this issue is put to a vote, the 90 % resolution is, in \nfact, difficult to  obtain (see e.g. Mu Qi and another v Management Corporation Strata Title \nPlan No 1849  [2021] 5 SLR 1401). Owners who live on the second floor often resist the \ninstallation of such awnings based on concerns about reflected heat from the awnings, noise \nwhen  it rains, loss of views, dirt from the awnings and security considerations. Indeed, these 1) Foo Siang Yean 2) Leong Fong Meng Irene     STB No. 109 of 202 2 \u2013 Oleander Towers   \n3) Tay Kheng Lock and Lim Hai Imm Doris vs  \n     the MCST Plan No. 2245  \n                               \n \n4 \n are precisely the objections which the Applicants, who are subsidiary proprietors living on \nthe second floor, are making in the present case. Hazel Easthope explains  the tension \nbetween owners in The Politics and Practices of Apartment Living (Edward Elgar, 2019) at \n8 as follows:  \n \nWhile home ownership is often associated with ideas of control and eminent \ndomain, condominium owners are seldom in a position to make indi vidual \ndecisions about their property and must negotiate and compromise with co -\nowners.  \n  \n5. Does this mean that a ground floor subsidiary proprietor has no right to fix awnings even if \nfaced with a killer litter problem if the 90 % resolution is not obtained ? Relying on the \nprescribed by -law by statute, specifically by-law 5(3) under the Second Schedule of the \nBuilding Maintenance ( Strata Management) Regulation 2005 , which stipulates that an \nowner shall not be prevented from installing safety devices or \u201cany structure or device to \nprevent harm to children\u201d, the Strata Titles Board has consistently held in several cases that \nan owner of a lot may install awnings as pro tective coverings even if the requisite 90 % \nresolution is not obtained if there is evidence of killer litter (Ahmad bin Ibrahim and others \nv The Management Corporation Strata Title Plan  No. 4131 (\u201cBelysa\u201d)  [2018] SGSTB 8) ; \nRosalina Soh Pei Xi v Hui Mun Wa i and Another (\u201cSuites @ Newton\u201d ) [2019] SGSSTB 5 ; \nPang Loon Ong and others v The Management Corporation Strata  Title Plan No. 4288  \n[2019] SGSTB 6; Lee Soh Geok v The Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 4417 \n(\u201cCitylife@Tampines\u201d)  [2020] SGSTB 9; Toh Cho Boon and Yong Phui Ling v The \nManagement Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 2748 (\u201cThe Queens Condominium\u201d) [2020] \nSGSTB 4; Nishad Ahmad Narod v The Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 3044 \n[2022] SGSTB 1) . Specifically, the Strata Titles Boa rd in a split decision held that the \nprescribed by -law applied to all developments by reason of section 32(2) of BMSMA, and \nthat no by -law made may be inconsistent with the prescribed by -law ( Lee Soh Geok v The \nManagement Corporation Strata Plan No. 4417 ( \u201cCitylife@Tampines\u201d)  [2020] SGSTB 9). \nSection 32(2) of BMSMA  states that no by -law made under section 33 of the BMSMA \n2004, which is the exclusive use provision, may be inconsistent with the prescribed by -law. \nTherefore, the conclusion is that the prescri bed by -law allows for the installation of safety \ndevices or \u2018any structure or device to prevent harm to children\u2019 without the requirement of \na 90 % resolution. This reasoning in Lee Soh Geok v The Management Corporation Strata \nPlan No. 4417 (\u201cCitylife@Tamp ines\u201d)  [2020] SGSTB 9 has been implicitly approved by a \nHigh Court decision where Ang Cheng Hock J said that an awning may be fixed if there was \nevidence of killer litter even though a 90 % resolution was not obtained ( Mu Qi and another \nv Management Corpor ation Strata Title Plan No 1849  [2021] 5 SLR 1401 at [82]). This \nBoard notes that the drafting of Singapore\u2019s prescribed by -laws appears to have been \ninspired by the model by-laws of New South Wales\u2019s Strata Schemes Management \nRegulation 2016 which is made  pursuant to the Strata Schemes Management Act 2015. \nHowever, the crucial difference between New South Wales and Singapore is that in the \nformer, the model by -laws have to be adopted by a strata development, whereas in \nSingapore, the prescribed by -laws are  mandatory in nature to all strata developments by 1) Foo Siang Yean 2) Leong Fong Meng Irene     STB No. 109 of 202 2 \u2013 Oleander Towers   \n3) Tay Kheng Lock and Lim Hai Imm Doris vs  \n     the MCST Plan No. 2245  \n                               \n \n5 \n virtue of section 32(2) of the BMSMA and may not be derogated from by the subsidiary \nproprietors.   \n \n6. The present case is different from all the other previous cases before the Strata Titles Board \nand the H igh Court because the awnings were installed pursuant to a by -law which was \npassed with unanimous resolution at an Annual General Meeting. In the present dispute, the \nApplicants are taking the position that the awnings which are installed is actually in breach \nof the relevant by -law. Hence, this case is essentially an issue of interpretation of the rel evant \nby-law and whether the awnings which were installed are consistent with the by -law passed.  \n \n7. The Notice of 21st Annual General Meeting dated 28 September 2020 provided for inter alia \nas follows : \n \n10.0 To resolve the following by -laws governing the covering of the Private \nOutdoor Space (Cover) following the revision of the URA guidelines with \neffect from 1 March 2014 with the following conditions:  \na. The Width of the Cover shall be no more than 2 metres from the external \nwall of the unit;  \nb. The design of the Cover must be certified by a Qualified Person at unit \nowner\u2019s own cost.  \nc. The design of the Cover shall be approved by the Council.  \nd. Any other conditions as imposed by the Council including the right for the \nCouncil to ask the subsidiary pro prietor to remove if it is causing a \nnuisance.  \n8. The 21st Annual General Meeting was held on 24 October 2020 and the following was \nrecorded at the meeting:  \n \nMr Mak Weng Tat (T1 # XXX ) \n\u201cYour two meter is not a statutory issue here. Two meter is the minimum \nrequirement for BSP cover. Under the instruction of URA, you can actually \ncover the whole private enclosed space\u201d.  \n\u201cWhat I\u2019m trying to say is,\u2026you should not put \u201cat more than\u201d\u2026Because we \nalready agreed in this meeting that we can cover according to the guid eline, but \nof course, based on our final task force discussion\u2026\u201d  \nMr Richard Kan (Chairman of Council)  1) Foo Siang Yean 2) Leong Fong Meng Irene     STB No. 109 of 202 2 \u2013 Oleander Towers   \n3) Tay Kheng Lock and Lim Hai Imm Doris vs  \n     the MCST Plan No. 2245  \n                               \n \n6 \n \u201calthough we put a maximum two meter, it\u2019s a guide only. Because you are four \nmeter. From the time you step out of your\u2026your main hall to the gate is four  \nmeter, I think. So we are putting two meter, it\u2019s the bylaw, we put two meter. \nBut once the task force comes in, there will be a set of guidelines that says that, \nI call it local rules, local rules where we can know that this can be done and all \nthat. \n\u201cthe task force will decide on the local rules here of this condo to say what is \nwhether 2.5 or 3 or whatever\u201d  \nMale voice in the background:  \n\u201cOkay, so URA also depends on case to case. As long as URA agrees, we can\u2019t \nstop them from approving it. So, right now  URA is 2 metres, anything above \nmaximum. So they got to get approval from URA.  \n \n9. It should be noted that Resolution 10 was tabled for a special resolution. However, \nResolution 10 was passed with a unanimous resolution. Both the Applicants and Respondent \nagree that despite Resolution 10 being tabled for a special resolution, the by -law is a valid \nexclusive use by -law because it was passed with unanimous resolution. The by -law which \nwas lodged with the Building and Construction Authority on 5 January 2021 pro vides:  \n \nIt was unanimously resolved as a by -law governing the covering of the Private \nOutdoor Space (Cover) following the revision of the URA guidelines with \neffect from 1 March 2014 with the following conditions:  \na. The Width of the Cover shall be no more than 2 metres from the \nexternal wall of the unit due to constraint on installation as it \nrequired to be mounted on the external wall which is common \nproperty/subject to the approval of URA;  \nb. The design of the Cover must be certified by a Qualified Pers on at \nunit owner\u2019s own cost.  \nc. The design of the Cover shall be approved by the Council.  \nd. Any other conditions as imposed by the Council including the right \nfor the Council to ask the subsidiary proprietor to remove if it is \ncausing a nuisance.  \n10. This resoluti on is now incorporated as By -Law 6.0 of the Development. It is not disputed \nthat the awnings that have been installed are beyond 2 metres. Many ground floor subsidiary 1) Foo Siang Yean 2) Leong Fong Meng Irene     STB No. 109 of 202 2 \u2013 Oleander Towers   \n3) Tay Kheng Lock and Lim Hai Imm Doris vs  \n     the MCST Plan No. 2245  \n                               \n \n7 \n proprietors have installed covers which span the entire outdoor space with covers \napprox imately 4 metres.  \n \nApplicant s\u2019 Case  \n \n11. The Applicants\u2019 case is that the installation of the awnings is in breach of By -Law 6.0. \nSpecifically, the Applicants urge this Board to consider By -Law 6.0 without the additional \nwords \u201c due to constraint on installation as it required to be mounted on the external wall \nwhich is common property/subject to the approval of URA\u201d since these words were not in \nresolution 10.1 in the Notice of 21st Annual General Meeting dated 28 September 2020. In \nany case, the App licants say that even if By -Law 6.0 is read with the additional words, it \ndoes not allow for awnings exceeding 2 metres from the external wall of the development.  \n  \nRespondent\u2019s Case  \n \n12. The Respondent\u2019s primary case is that By -Law 6.0 should be \u201cinterpreted as a guide, the \nwidth of the cover shall be no more than 2 metres from the external wall of the unit and the \ncover may be larger if approved by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (\u201c URA \u201d). This was \nthe understanding of all the residents who were  present and who unanimously voted to pass \nproposed Resolution 10.00 into By -Law 6.0\u201d.  \n \n13. The difference between the Applicants\u2019 position and Respondent\u2019s case appears to be whether \nin interpreting By -law 6.0, the Board is entitled to refer to extrinsic evi dence, namely, what \nwas said at the 21st Annual General Meeting.  \n \nThe Law on Interpretation of By -Laws  \n \n14. Section 32 of the BMSMA provides that every parcel comprised in a strata title is regulated \nby by -laws. There are several types of by -laws envisaged in the BMSMA: (a) prescribed by -\nlaws which are mandatory to every strata title plan which may not be deroga ted from (section \n32(2) of the BMSMA); (b) ordinary resolution by -laws (see e.g. exclusive use of common \nproperty upon conditions for a period not exceeding one year pursuant to section 33(1)(1) of \nthe BMSMA); (c) by -laws which may be made by a special res olution for certain matters \n(see e.g. sections 32(3) and 33(1)(b) of the BMSMA); and (d) by -laws which require a 90 % \nresolution (see e.g. exclusive use by -laws for a period which exceeds 3 years which must be \nmade pursuant to section 33(1)(c) of the BMSMA ).   \n \n15. Before identifying the relevant principles in relation to the interpretation of by -laws, it is \nimportant to determine the legal nature of by -laws. In Australia, there is some debate whether \nby-laws should properly be regarded as a form of delegated l egislation or statutory contracts \n(see The Owners of Strata Plan No 3397 v Tate (2007) 70 NSWLR 344; Cathy Sherry, Strata \nTitle Property Rights, (Routledge, 2017), 148 - 152). In Singapore, this question appears to 1) Foo Siang Yean 2) Leong Fong Meng Irene     STB No. 109 of 202 2 \u2013 Oleander Towers   \n3) Tay Kheng Lock and Lim Hai Imm Doris vs  \n     the MCST Plan No. 2245  \n                               \n \n8 \n be settled. According to Judith Prakash J  (as she then was) in Choo Kok Lin v Management \nCorporation Strata Title Plan No 2405 [2005] 4 SLR(R) 175 at [23] by -laws are \u201cconsidered \nto be statutorily constituted contracts between the management corporation and the \nsubsidiary proprietors\u2026\u201d This analy sis has been adopted in a number of Singapore cases \n(Chia Sok Kheng Kathleen v Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 669  [2004] 4 \nSLR(R) 27 at [40] \u2013[41]; Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 2911 v Tham Keng \nMun [2011] 1 SLR 1263 at [62] \u2013 [64]; Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 940 \nv Lim Florence Majorie [2019] 4 SLR 73 at [113]; Prem N Shamdasani v Management \nCorporation Strata Title Plan No 920 [2022] SGHC 280 at [78]).  \n \n16. Since by -laws are a form of statutorily constituted contrac ts, the next issue would be whether \nSingapore\u2019s jurisprudence on interpretation of contracts, especially the cases on the use of \nextrinsic evidence in interpreting contracts (see e.g. Sembcorp Marine Ltd v PPL Holdings \nPte Ltd [2013] 4 SLR 193;  Tuitiongeni us Pte Ltd v Toh Yew Keat  [2021] 1 SLR 231), is \nrelevant to the construction of by -laws in a strata development. The complication here is that \nthe Singapore cases on interpretation of contracts and the use of extrinsic of evidence revolve \naround the applic ation of the Evidence Act 1893. In this regard, the Evidence Act 1893 is \nnot applicable to Strata Titles Board proceedings. Section 15 of the Land Titles (Strata Titles \nBoards) Regulations 1999 provides that the Strata Titles Board \u201cshall not be bound to a pply \nthe rules of evidence applicable to civil proceedings in any court but may inform itself on \nany matter in such manner as it thinks fit\u201d. This leads to the following issue whether the law \nin Singapore on interpretation of contracts and the use of extri nsic evidence is a matter of \nevidence law. In BQP v BQQ [2018] SGHC 55 at [122], Quentin Loh J held that the question \nof admissibility of extrinsic evidence in construing written agreements was a question of \nevidence or procedural law. Hence, Loh J held th at since international arbitration proceedings \nare not bound by the Evidence Act 1893, Singapore\u2019s case law on the admissibility of \nextrinsic evidence do not apply in international arbitration proceedings. The Strata Titles \nBoard is similarly not bound by the Evidence At 1893; it must follow that Singapore\u2019s \njurisprudence on interpretation of contracts which is premised on the Evidence Act 1893 is \ninapplicable to the present hearing.  \n \n17. We note that Goh Yihan JC (as he then was) in Prem N Shamdasani v Manage ment \nCorporation Strata Title Plan No 0920 [2022] SGHC 280  at [179]  has recently pointed out \nthat subsidiary proprietors have a choice to bring disputes before the courts or the Strata \nTitles Board at first instance as the Strata Titles Board does  not have exclusive jurisdiction \nover disputes under the BMSMA. Thus, if the matter is brought before the Strata Titles \nBoard, issues of construction of by -laws would be decided without reference to the Evidence \nAct 1893 whereas if the dispute was filed in  the High Court, Singapore\u2019s jurisprudence on \ninterpretation of contracts might be applicable if by -laws are properly considered as a form \nof contract. This position does not appear to be logical nor satisfactory. Nevertheless, this is \nnot an issue that th is Board may resolve at this stage and is better examined by the policy \nmakers the next time the relevant statute is reviewed. For the present purposes, the Board \nwill proceed on the basis that Singapore\u2019s jurisprudence on interpretation of contracts and 1) Foo Siang Yean 2) Leong Fong Meng Irene     STB No. 109 of 202 2 \u2013 Oleander Towers   \n3) Tay Kheng Lock and Lim Hai Imm Doris vs  \n     the MCST Plan No. 2245  \n                               \n \n9 \n the use of extrinsic evidence is not applicable because the Evidence Act 1893 is inapplicable \nto the present hearing.    \n  \n18. It may be useful to look at jurisdictions with a similar statutory scheme to determine the \nprinciples associated with interpretation o f by-laws. The BMSMA was drafted after the \npolicy makers studied legislation from Australia and Canada ( see Singapore Parliamentary \nDebates, Official Report  (19 April 2004) vol  77 at cols  2744 \u20132745 (Mah Bow Tan, Minister \nfor National Development ; Prem N Sh amdasani v Management Corporation Strata Title \nPlan No 0920 [2022] SGHC 280  at [45]) . Hence, it might be worthwhile to examine the law \nin those jurisdictions for guidance on the interpretation of by -laws. Indeed, this was the \napproach by Goh Yihan JC (as he then was) in Prem N Shamdasani v Management \nCorporation Strata Title Plan No 0920 [2022] SGHC 280  at [45] in relation to the building \nfa\u00e7ade of a strata development. In the context of the Land Titles Act, VK Rajah J (as he then \nwas) in United Overseas B ank Ltd v Chia Kin Tuck [2006] 3 SLR (R) 322 at [21] said since \nSingapore land law was inspired by the Australian Torrens System, it is profitable to refer to \ninter alia  relevant legal material from Australia. Therefore, this Board will review the \njurispru dence of Canada and Australia in relation to the principles on interpretation of by -\nlaws.  \n \n19. The leading case in Australia is the decision of McColl JA (with Mason P agreeing) in The \nOwners of Strata Plan No 3397 v Tate (2007) 70 NSWLR 344. McColl JA helpfu lly \nsummarized the law on interpretation of by -laws as follows:  \nThe following propositions emerge from the foregoing discussion:  \n1. By-laws are the \u201cseries of enactments\u201d by which the proprietors in a body  \ncorporate administer their affairs; they do not deal with commercial rights, \nbut \nthe governance of the strata scheme: Bailey ; \n2. By-laws have a public purpose which goes beyond their function of \nfacilitating  \nthe internal administration of a body corporate; cp, Parkin, Lion Nathan ; \n3. Exclusive use by -laws may be i nspected by third persons interested in \nacquiring an interest in a strata scheme, whether, for example, by acquiring \nunits, or by lending money to a lot proprietor; such persons would ordinarily \nhave no access to the circumstances surrounding their making;  their \nmeaning  should be  understood from their statutory context and language: \nNRMA ; Lion Nathan ; \n4. By-laws may be characterised as either delegated legislation or statutory  \ncontacts: Dainford; Re Taylor ; Bailey ; North Wind ; Sons of Gwalia ; \n5. Whichever be the appropriate characterisation, exclusive use by -laws \nshould be interpreted objectively by what they would convey to a \nreasonable person: Lion Nathan ; 1) Foo Siang Yean 2) Leong Fong Meng Irene     STB No. 109 of 202 2 \u2013 Oleander Towers   \n3) Tay Kheng Lock and Lim Hai Imm Doris vs  \n     the MCST Plan No. 2245  \n                               \n \n10 \n 6. In interpreting exclusive use by -laws the court should take into account \ntheir constitutional function in the strata scheme in regulating the rights and \nliabilities of lot proprietors inter se: Parkin ; Lion Nathan ; \n7. Unlike the articles of a company, there does not appear to be a strong \nargument  for saying exclusive use by -laws should be interpreted as a \nbusiness document,  with the intention that they be given business efficacy: \ncf NRMA  at [75]. That  does not mean that an exclusive use by -law may not \nhave a commercial purpose,  and be interpreted in accordance with the \nprinciples expound ed in cases such as  Antaios Compania Naviera SA , but \ndue regard must be paid to the statutory  context in so doing;  \n8. An exclusive use by -law should be construed so that it is consistent with its  \nstatutory context; a court may depart from such a construction if departure \nfrom  the statutory scheme is authorised by the governing statute and if the \nintention to do so appears plainly from the terms of the by -law: Re Taylor ; \n9. Caution should be exercised in going beyond the language of the by -law \nand its  statutory co ntext to ascertain its meaning; a tight rein should be kept \non having  recourse to surrounding circumstances: Lion Nathan . \n \n20. Professor Cathy Sherry argues in Strata Title Property Rights, (Routledge, 2017), 151 that \nextrinsic evidence should not be referred to in relation to interpreting by -laws. Sherry argues:  \n \n\u2026the rules in relation to extrinsic evidence used to interpret a company \nconstitution relate to surrounding circumstances known to, or easily capable of \nbeing ascertained by third parties\u2026In the context of a strata scheme, many \nowners are unlikely to know anything of the circumstances in which a by -law \nwas created, either because they were not members of the body corporate when \nthe by -law was made or because they did not attend the relevant meetin g\u2026The \nfundamental premise in both contract and corporate law is that it is only \nextrinsic evidence and surrounding circumstances known to the parties or \nascertainable by them that can be used to aid interpretation of words, and this \npresents a very real im pediment to applying contract or corporate interpretation \ncase law to strata by -laws. (emphasis in the original)  \n \n21. Sherry\u2019s argument is apposite in the Singapore context. When a by -law is passed, there is a \nrequirement that the by -law must be lodged by the management corporation with the \nCommissioner of Buildings pursuant to section 32(5) of the BMSMA. Hence, the by -laws \nshould be interpreted based on the language of the by -law which has been lodged with the \nCommissioner of Buildings. One cannot expect that the by -laws are to be interpreted only \nafter reading what was said in the Annual General Meeting.   \n \n22. The principles in relation to construction of by -laws have also been considered in Canada. \nMoure v Strata Plan NW 2099 [2003] BCJ No. 2071 is a decision fr om British Columbia \nSupreme Court which dealt with the use of extrinsic evidence in interpreting by -laws. In this \ncase, a Mr Loren had given affidavit evidence explaining the change of the by -laws. \nGroberman J cautioned against the use of extrinsic evidenc e as follows:  1) Foo Siang Yean 2) Leong Fong Meng Irene     STB No. 109 of 202 2 \u2013 Oleander Towers   \n3) Tay Kheng Lock and Lim Hai Imm Doris vs  \n     the MCST Plan No. 2245  \n                               \n \n11 \n  \nIn my view, Mr. Loren's evidence on this point is of very limited value. The \nbylaws, as they exist from time to time, must be understandable by the people \ngoverned by them. Except perhaps where there is an irresolvable ambiguity, \nextrinsic e vidence such as that of Mr. Loren should not be used to interpret \nstrata corporation by -laws.  \n \n23. In Wilson v Condominium Corp No 021 1057 2010 ABPC 150 at [23] Hess ACJ:  \n \nIn my view, principles of contract interpretation dealing with ascertaining the \nintention of the parties to a contract and implying terms to give effect to that \nintention have no application to the interpretation of the rights and obligations \ncreated by by-laws promulgated under the requirements imposed by legislation. \nBy-laws are not negotiated as between the condominium  corporation and unit \nowners and I [ sic] my view the court should not be reading provisions into the \nby-laws at the instance of either of the parties . \n \n24. ML Dovell J in Tofin v Spadina Condominium Corp [2011] SJ No. 400 at [40] \u2013 [41] \nobserved (\u201c Tofin \u201d): \n\u2026[t]he Court has concluded that principles of contract interpretation have no place \nwithin the scope of the wit hin application, being the interpretation of a condominium  \nbylaw. This process is not analogous to the interpretation of a contract. The owners of \ncondominiums  within a condominium  corporation are not in the same position as the \nparties to a specific contr act. \nAlthough s. 44(3) of the Act makes reference to the bylaws of a corporation binding \nthe corporation and the owners to the same extent as if the bylaws had been signed and \nsealed by the corporation and by each owner, the resultant relationship is not t he same \nas that of individual parties who had agreed to the terms of the contract. \nNotwithstanding some of the owners of a condominium  corporation not being in \nagreement with certain provisions of the bylaws, those same owners are bound to \ncomply with all of the provisions of the bylaws eventually enacted by that \ncondominium  corporation.  \n \n25. Tofin was cited with approval in Summer Services Ltd v Karwood Commercial Condominium \nCorp [2016] NJ No 184 and Condominium Plan No 7721985 v Breakwell [2019] AJ No 1159 \nat [51].  \n \n26. RP Stack J in Summer Services Ltd v Karwood Commercial Condominium Corp [2016] NJ \nNo 184 at [32] stated that condominium by -laws:  \n \nmust be interpreted by giving the words used their plain and ordinary meaning, \nand not an expanded meaning, and as a reasonably informed unit holder would \nread it ( Pearson (Litigation Guardian of) v. Carleton Condominium Corp. No. \n178, 2012 ONSC 3300  at para. 23, relying on Metropolitan Toronto 1) Foo Siang Yean 2) Leong Fong Meng Irene     STB No. 109 of 202 2 \u2013 Oleander Towers   \n3) Tay Kheng Lock and Lim Hai Imm Doris vs  \n     the MCST Plan No. 2245  \n                               \n \n12 \n Condominium Corp. No. 699 v. 1177 Yonge Street Inc ., (1998) 39 O.R. (3d) \n473 at para. 6, 109 O.A.C. 192 . \n \n27. Drawing all the threads from these decisions in Australia and Canada, this Board adopts the \nfollowing principles in interpreting by -laws:  \n \ni. By-laws should be interpreted objectively by what they would convey to a reason able \nperson ( The Owners of Strata Plan No 3397 v Tate (2007) 70 NSWLR 344) . In other \nwords, by -laws \u201cmust be interpreted by giving the words used their plain and ordinary \nmeaning, and not an expanded meaning, and as a reasonably informed unit holder would \nread it\" ( Pearson (Litigation Guardian of) v. Carleton Condominium Corp. No. 178 , 2012 \nONSC 3300  at para. 23, relying on Metropolitan Toronto Condominium Corp. No. 699 \nv. 1177 Yonge Street Inc ., (1998) 39 O.R. (3d) 473  at para. 6, 109 O.A.C. 192 ; \n \nii. Caution should be exercised in going beyond the language of the by -law and its statutory \ncontext to ascertain its meaning; a tight rein should be kept on having recourse to \nsurrounding circumstances  (The Owners of Strata Plan No 3397 v Tate (2007) 70 \nNSWLR 344) ;  \n \niii. Extrinsic evidence should not be referred to in interpreting by -laws (see Moure v Strata \nPlan NW 2099 [2003] BCJ No. 2071) because many owners and third parties may not \nknow anything of the c ircumstances in which a by -law is created (see Strata Title \nProperty Rights, (Routledge, 2017), 151);  \n \niv. Principles of contractual interpretation dealing with ascertaining the intention of the \nparties to a contract are not applicable because: (a) the Evidenc e Act 1893 does not apply \nto Strata Titles Board proceedings; and (b) there is a significant difference between by -\nlaws and contracts. By -laws are not negotiated contracts (see Wilson v Condominium \nCorp No 021 1057 2010  ABPC 150) and they bind subsidiary p roprietors who did not \nagree to the by -laws (see Tofin ). \n \nApplication of the Law to the Facts on By -Law 6.0  \n \n28. By-Law 6.0 has to be interpreted objectively by what they convey to a reasonable person  \nwithout reference to extrinsic evidence. In particular, what was said in the 21st Annual \nGeneral Meeting may not be referred to because this represents material which would not be \nknown by third parties and those who did not attend the meeting.  \n \n29. Even if we take the Respondent\u2019s case at its highest and include the additional words \nincorporated in By -Law 6.0, this Board holds that the awnings which have been installed \nbreaches the relevant By -Law. By -Law 6.0 provides:  \n 1) Foo Siang Yean 2) Leong Fong Meng Irene     STB No. 109 of 202 2 \u2013 Oleander Towers   \n3) Tay Kheng Lock and Lim Hai Imm Doris vs  \n     the MCST Plan No. 2245  \n                               \n \n13 \n The Width of the Cover shall be no mo re than 2 metres from the external wall of the \nunit due to constraint on installation as it required to be mounted on the external wall \nwhich is common property/subject to the approval of URA . \n30. The words \u201cThe Width of the Cover shall be no more than 2 metres \u201d conveys to a reasonable \nperson precisely what it says i.e. the awnings should be no more than 2 metres. There is no \nambiguity whatsoever with the words \u201cThe Width of the Cover shall be no more than 2 \nmetres \u201d. This Board does not think that the word s \u201csubject to the approval of URA\u201d means \nthat the awnings could be more than 2 metres. Since the awnings which have been installed \nspans almost 4 metres, this Board cannot see how By -Law 6.0, as it stands, can be said to be \nconsistent with the awnings whic h have been installed.  \n \n31. For completeness, this Board is of the view that By -Law 6.0  is not inconsistent with \nprescribed by-law 5(3) under the Second Schedule of the B uilding Maintenance ( Strata \nManagement) Regulation 2005 which allows for installing safe ty devices or \u201cany structure \nor device to prevent harm to children\u201d. In other words, By -Law 6.0 allows for the installation \nof structures or devices to prevent harm to children albeit at a limit of 2 metres. Since By -\nLaw 6.0 specifically provides that the Covers should not exceed 2 metres, this Board holds \nthat awnings which exceed 2 metres is in breach of the said by -law.  \n \n32. The Applicants have urged the Board to order the : \n \nRespondent shall notify the subsidiary proprietors of Block 911 # XXX  and \n#XXX  and Blk 913 #XXX  and # XXX  of Oleander Towers (\u201c Ground Floor \nSPs\u201d) that they are to remove the covers (the \u201c Covers \u201d) installed over the entire \nPrivate Outdoor Space (\u201c POS \u201d) of their respective units and/or alternatively, if \nthe Ground Floor SPS fail to remove the Covers within 14 days of being \nnotified to do by the Respondent and that the Respondent proceed to demolish \nthe Covers at its own cost with liberty to claim the s aid costs from the Ground \nFloor SPs.  \n \n33. This Board does not consider it reasonable or prudent to order that the Respondent proceed \nto unilaterally demolish the Covers within 14 days if the ground floor subsidiary proprietors \nrefuse to take down the Covers. In Mu Qi and another v Management Corporation Strata \nTitle Plan No 1849  [2021] 5 SLR 1401, Ang Cheng Hock J allowed the management \ncorporation 3 months to attempt to obtain a 90 % resolution to regularize the awnings. \nFurthermore, the learned judge contemp lated that the management corporation had to get the \nnecessary orders from the Strata Titles Board in order to get the 14th floor subsidiary \nproprietors to comply.  \n \n34. This Board orders that the Respondent shall notify the subsidiary proprietors of Block 911 \n#XXX  and # XXX and Blk 913 #XXX  and # XXX  of Oleander To wers (\u201c Ground Floor \nSPs\u201d) that  their pre -existing covers are in breach of By -Law 6.0, and they are to remove these 1) Foo Siang Yean 2) Leong Fong Meng Irene     STB No. 109 of 202 2 \u2013 Oleander Towers   \n3) Tay Kheng Lock and Lim Hai Imm Doris vs  \n     the MCST Plan No. 2245  \n                               \n \n14 \n covers. If the Ground Floor SP s refuse to remove the Covers, then the Respondent sh ould \ntake the necessary civil proceedings against the Ground Floor SP s to remove the Covers.  \n \n35. This Board  notes that certain representations may have been made to the Ground Floor SP s \nwhich may be relevant in the civil proceedings  by the Respondent against the Ground Floor \nSPs.  \n \n36. Finally, this Board thanks Counsel for the Applicants, Ms Roslina  bte Baba and Mr Haziq \nIka and Respondent, Mr Justin Chia, Mr Charles Ho and Ms Toh Ming Wai for their effective \nadvocacy, helpful submissio ns and collegiality which led to this matter being heard in less \nthan two days. This Board would like to acknowledge and thank the young amicus curiae, \nElias Khong Ngai Hum, for his research assistance.   \n \n37.

Tan Chin Pei (the \u201c Applicant \u201d) is the subsidiary proprietor (\u201c SP\u201d) of 3 Jalan Anak Bukit, #XXX, \n(S) 588998, in the development known as Bukit Timah Plaza/Sherwood Towers. Robert Francis \nDe Rozario (the \u201c Respondent\u201d)  is the SP of the unit situated immediately above the Applicant in \nthe same stack, i.e., 3 Jalan Anak Bukit, #XXX, (S) 588998. Both units are studio apartments. \n2. In this case of alleged inter floor leakage, the orders sought by the Applicant are as follows:  \ni. The Respondent to engage, at his own cost, a Building and Construction Authority (BCA) \nregistered building contractor to carry out repairs to resolve the water leakage into and \nwater damage caused to the Applicant\u2019s unit, to the satisfaction of a building surveyor /    Tan Chin Pei vs Robert Francis De Rozario                        STB No. 99 of 2022 \u2013  Bukit Timah Plaza/Sherwood       \nTowers  \n                                \n \n3 \n water seepage specialist engaged by the Applicant. Such corrective works shall be \ncompleted within ten (10) weeks of the date of the Board\u2019s order. \nii. The Respondent to pay the Applicant damages for inconvenience, anxiety and/or loss of \nenjoyment. \niii. The Respondent to bear the Applicant\u2019s costs and disbursements of and incidental to  this \nApplication including legal fees, STB fees and surveyor\u2019s fees. \nISSUES BEFORE THE BOARD \n3. There were four main issues to be decided \u2013 one preliminary issue and three substantive issues \nthat arose from the hearing.  \nThe Preliminary Issue \n4. The significance of the Agreement dated 21 December 2022 (\u201cthe Agreement\u201d) which was signed \nby the Parties (the \u201cPreliminary Issue\u201d) arose because of a submission made by the Respondent at \nthe 11th hour \u2013 on the first day of the hearing on the morning of 2 May 2023. In short, the \nRespondent took the view that the hearing need not be conducted as the parties had in the \nAgreement, already agreed to appoint one Eddie Chong Keng Wee (\u201cMr. Chong\u201d), a Professional \nEngineer (PE), and be bound by his findings and recommended rectifications to be carried out. \nThe Applicant did not object to the application and the Board considered the submission and \nrendered its decision orally, ruling against the Respondent. As there may have been no necessity \nof a hearing had the Board accepted the Respondent\u2019s submissions on the Preliminary Issue, these \nGrounds of Decision (\u201cGD\u201d) reiterate the oral reasons given by the Board regarding the \nPreliminary Issue. \n5. The material words in paragraph 1 of the Agreement state that the \u2018 Parties are to jointly appoint \nEddie Chong\u2026 failing which parties will jointly source and appoint a professional Building \nSurveyor.\u2019 While the Respondent took the view that this meant that the parties had already agreed \nto appoint Eddie Chong, the Board took the view that the words \u2018failing which\u2019 contemplated \nscenarios where Mr. Chong failed to be jointly appointed \u2013 either because he was unable to \nunwilling to take up the job, or because either party did not agree to have him so appointed.  \n \n6. The various emails exhibited by the Respondent dated 29 and 30 December 2022 show that the \nApplicant never acquiesced to the appointment of Mr. Chong. Tellingly, in an email dated 3 \nJanuary 2023 written by the Respondent\u2019s counsel which purports to confirm Mr. Chong\u2019s \nappointment, the email materially states \u2018 We are instructed by our client  that he accepts  the    Tan Chin Pei vs Robert Francis De Rozario                        STB No. 99 of 2022 \u2013  Bukit Timah Plaza/Sherwood       \nTowers  \n                                \n \n4 \n revised quotation and accordingly, we return and enclose herewith a softcopy of the same duly \nexecuted by us on behalf of our client \u2019[emphasis added]. It is patent that the Respondent\u2019s counsel \ntook the position that only their client \u2013 the Respondent \u2013 had agreed to appoint Mr. Chong, and \nthey never, rightly in our view, took the position that the appointment of Mr. Chong was endorsed \nby the Applicant.  \n7. The Board\u2019s view is further buttressed by the fact that while the parties entered into the Agreement \non 21 December 2022, Mr. Chong only presented a quotation, and subsequently a revised \nquotation, for his professional services on 28 and 30 December 2022 respectively. It would be \nunreasonable and unduly onerous to say that the parties were irrevocably bound to appoint Mr. \nChong without even seeing his quotation, assuming only that he was willing and able to take on \nthe project. \n8. As the Agreement entered between the parties was legally valid but the parties had failed to jointly \nappoint either Mr. Chong or a professional building surveyor, the Board took the view that both \nparties were prima facie  in breach of the Agreement. In the many months since entering into the \nAgreement, both parties could have done more, such as seeking guidance from the Board via a 3rd \nmediation session, to ensure that someone was appointed.  \n9. After the Board rendered its oral decision on the Preliminary Issue, the Respondent invited the \nApplicant to jointly appoint any professional building surveyor of her choice, pursuant to the \nAgreement. The Applicant did not wish to do so, citing the long delay regarding the leak which \nshe claimed was attributed to the Respondent. While the Respondent\u2019s offer was made pursuant \nto a validly entered Agreement, the Board was mindful that under section 92(9) of the Building \nMaintenance and Strata Management Act 2004  (\u201cBMSA\u201d), it is duty bound to make a final order \nor determination within six months from the date it is constituted, i.e., by 28 May 2023. \nAccordingly, having disposed of the Preliminary Issue, the Board proceeded to hear the \nsubstantive merits of the case.         \nSubstantive Issues \n10. An arbitration hearing involving five witnesses \u2013 the Applicant, Respondent and three expert \nwitnesses, was conducted before the Board on 2 and 3 May 2023. As with cases of this nature, the \ncase turned on the views of the experts, rather than the opinions of the parties. Neither party sought \nto discredit the credentials of each other\u2019s experts, and the Board took the view that all three \nexperts \u2013 Goh Choong Siong (\u201cMr. Goh\u201d) and Dinesh Kumar (\u201cMr. Kumar\u201d) who gave evidence \nas the Applicant\u2019s witnesses, and Paul Crispin Casimir-Mrowczynski (\u201cMr. Casimir\u201d) who gave    Tan Chin Pei vs Robert Francis De Rozario                        STB No. 99 of 2022 \u2013  Bukit Timah Plaza/Sherwood       \nTowers  \n                                \n \n5 \n evidence as the Respondent\u2019s witness, had professional demeanours and appeared candid with \ntheir evidence. Upon hearing the parties and considering their respective submissions, the Board \nconsidered that there were three substantive issues arising from the hearing: \ni. Whether the statutory presumption under section 101(8) of the BMSA applied in favour \nof the Applicant. \nii.  If the answer to (i) is \u2018Yes,\u2019 whether the Respondent has rebutted the presumption on the \nbalance of probabilities. \niii.  If the answer to (i) is \u2018No,\u2019 whether the Applicant has nonetheless proven that the cause \nof the leak in her unit is attributable to the Respondent\u2019s unit.    \nAPPLICANTS\u2019 CASE \n11. Being the SP of the unit affected by the leak, the affidavit of evidence-in-chief (AEIC) of the \nApplicant (A2) states that she had been suffering from water seepage since September 2022, as \nwell as dampness and moisture from the ceiling, and along the walls of her kitchen and bedroom. \n12. The Applicant engaged IGM Integrated Pte Ltd (\u201cIGM\u201d), a water intrusion specialist company and \na Leak Condition Survey Report (\u201cSurvey Report\u201d) dated 22 February 20231 was tendered as \nevidence. Both reports were prepared by Mr. Kumar, an IGM water intrusion engineer, and \nvalidated by Mr. Goh, a chartered building engineer and consultant at IGM. \n13. IGM\u2019s Survey Report utilised a combination of radio-waves, ultra-waves and visual observations \nperformed by Mr. Kumar. Materially, the Survey Report noted that in the Applicant\u2019s unit, there \nwere \u2018water stains observed at kitchen concrete ceiling adjoining affected kitchen wall \u2019 (Survey \nReport Fig 2.2). Mr. Kumar also explained that the radio wave imaging confirmed this visual \nobservation (Fig 2.3). The report also observed that there was \u2018 dampness and discoloration  (sic) \nof cement observed at bathroom RC ceiling \u2019 (Figs 2.10 and 2.11) in the Applicant\u2019s unit. \n \n14. IGM performed a water spray test at the Respondent\u2019s (upper floor) unit by continuously spraying \nwater for 20 minutes at the left corner of the wall of the long bath (Fig 2.28). After approximately \nan hour and a half later, water was seen \u2018 oozing out \u2019 from the flooring below the affected kitchen \nwall in the Applicant\u2019s unit (Fig 2.29 and conclusion of Survey Report).                   \n \n1 While the Survey Report was dated 22 February 2023, Mr. Kumar explained that this was the date that IGM was first \nengaged by the Applicant. Mr. Kumar visited the units to perform the leak assessment on 1 and 4 March 2023. There was \nalso an IGM Supplementary Report based on a site visit done on 24 March 2023.

The Respondent\u2019s position is that there is no evidence of an inter-floor leak. \n16. The Respondent\u2019s expert is Crispin Casimir, a Chartered Building Surveyor, of CC Building \nSurveyors Pte Ltd (\u201cCC\u201d), Mr. Casimir\u2019s eponymous company. CC conducted its inspection on 2 \nFebruary 2023 and the Respondent subsequently submitted CC\u2019s Inspection Report (\u201cCC\u2019s \nReport) regarding the alleged inter-floor leakage between the parties\u2019 units. \n17. CC\u2019s observation of a pool of water in the Applicant\u2019s kitchen corroborated the existence of a leak. \nHowever, CC took the view that \u2018 there was no evidence that the water was emanating from the \nupper wall level, soffit or the unit above \u2019 (para 3.1 of CC\u2019s Report). Instead, CC suggested that the \nsource of water emanated from the air-conditioning pipework condensate within the Applicant\u2019s \nunit and/or the refuse chute, which is part of the common property (paras 3.1 and 4.0). \n18. On 24 March 2023, CC conducted a further inspection on both units and issued a Further \nInspection Report (FIR). Notably, this was done after the bathtub sealant in the Respondent\u2019s unit \nhad been recently replaced (para 3.1, FIR). According to the FIR, there was no moisture staining \nat the kitchen ceiling, and the bathroom ceiling void \u2018 appeared dry \u2019 albeit with \u2018 localised \nstaining.\u2019 CC\u2019s FIR also stated that there was no evidence of any leakage or calcium carbonate \nbuild-up (para 3.1, FIR). CC also repeated the water spray test done by IGM earlier in that month \n(where the Respondent\u2019s shower head was turned on and directed towards the tiled wall and \nbathtub interface for 20 minutes). According to the FIR, there was no leakage at the bathroom \nceiling or soffit an hour after the water spray test. CC\u2019s FIR reiterated that the water damage \nsuffered by the Applicant\u2019s unit is attributed to condensate relating to that unit\u2019s air-conditioning \nsystem and/or water from the refuse chute (para 4.0, FIR).   \nANALYSIS OF THE ISSUES \nI. The statutory presumption  \n19. The first substantive issue that emerged from the hearing is whether the statutory presumption \nunder section 101(8) of the BMSMA applies in favour of the Applicant. The sub-section materially \nreads: \n(8) In any proceedings under this section with respect to any alleged defect in a lot\u2026 situated \nimmediately (whether wholly or partly) above another lot\u2026, it is presumed, in the absence of \nproof to the contrary, that the defect is within that lot\u2026 above if there is any evidence of \ndampness, moisture or water penetration \u2013     Tan Chin Pei vs Robert Francis De Rozario                        STB No. 99 of 2022 \u2013  Bukit Timah Plaza/Sherwood       \nTowers  \n                                \n \n7 \n (a) On the ceiling that forms part of the interior of the lot\u2026 immediately below; or \n(b) On any finishing material (including plaster, panel or gypsum board) attached, glued, laid \nor applied to the ceiling that forms part of the interior of the lot\u2026 immediately below.   \nPurpose of the Presumption    \n20. Parliament made statutory changes in 2004 to enact the presumption of inter-floor leakages. The \nSelect Committee noted that \u2018in disputes over inter-floor leakages, the fault is usually with the \nupper floor unit\u2019, and that upper floor unit owners tend to be uncooperative. As noted by the then \nMinister for National Development (MND), the presumption of liability will make upper floor \nunit owners more responsive to lower unit owners who have to bear with the inconvenience and \ndistress so long as the leakages remain unresolved.2 The presumption is thus meant to facilitate \nand expedite the resolution of such disputes.3         \nApplicability of the Presumption  \n21. As the learned District Judge in Lim Chuen Khen v Ho Li Ming  [2011] SGDC 160 rightly noted \nhowever, this presumption only applies in relation to proceedings before the Strata Titles Board, \nand not the courts. The court in that case came to this conclusion because of the words \u2018in any \nproceedings under this section\u2019 stated in section 101(8), as well as the words in section 101(1): \n\u2018\u2026a Board may\u2026\u2019 Applicants who seek recourse before the court for inter-floor leakages must \ntherefore positively prove their case, as they do not have recourse to the statutory presumption. As \nstated by the Minister at the third reading of the 2004 bill, at paragraph 31: \u2018 \u2026the Bill attributes a \nrebuttable presumption of liability to the upper floor unit owner for such cases that are handled \nby the STB .\u2019 Indeed, this comports with the policy intent to have strata matters quickly and \nefficiently handled by the Board.  \n22. A survey of the case law indicates that while the presumption is fairly frequently invoked before \nthe Board, it may be instructive to more fully articulate when the presumption arises. In respect of \nalleged inter-floor leakages, it should first be noted that there is an evidential  burden on the part \nof the lot below to show \u2018evidence of dampness, moisture or water penetration\u2019 on the lower lot\u2019s \nceiling or on any finishing material attached to the ceiling of the lower lot. As the word \u2018ceiling\u2019 \nunder section 2 of the BMSA does not include any false ceiling, the language of subsection \n101(8)(b) of the Act provides that if any finishing material attached to the actual ceiling (e.g., a \n \n2 Singapore Parliamentary Debates ; Vol. 78, Sitting No. 6; (19 Oct 2004) at cols. 931-2 (Minister Mah Bow Tan). \n3 ibid.    Tan Chin Pei vs Robert Francis De Rozario                        STB No. 99 of 2022 \u2013  Bukit Timah Plaza/Sherwood       \nTowers  \n                                \n \n8 \n false ceiling) showed evidence of dampness, moisture, or water penetration, that this would be \nsufficient to invoke the presumption.  \n23. The words \u2018defect in a lot\u2019 are inseparable from the leak or moisture and need not be separately \nshown. As noted by Teo Keang Sood\u2019s Strata Title in Singapore and Malaysia  (6th edn)4, the \nBoard in Ng Kim Kee v Chee Yeok Fhoon5 rightly noted that the ceiling of one apartment is the \nfloor of the apartment immediately above it and is intended not merely to separate one apartment \nfrom another but to insulate it against incursions of anything whatsoever from the apartment above \ninto the apartment below. In that case, the Respondent had argued that the Applicant had not \nreferred to broken pipes or cracked pipes or wall cracks but simply to water leakage. The Ng Kim \nKee Board however noted that if moisture percolates through the floor/ceiling for any reason, then \nthe floor of the upper apartment is defective. Accordingly, a SP in the lower lot who can show \nevidence of dampness, moisture or water penetration on their ceiling or finishing material attached \nto their ceiling would also be showing that there is a defect in the upper lot.  \n24. In the Board\u2019s view, the words \u2018in the absence of proof to the contrary\u2019 and \u2018any evidence of \ndampness, moisture or water penetration\u2019 are interrelated and bear analysis. The phrase \u2018any \nevidence of dampness, moisture or water penetration\u2019 places an evidential burden on the SP on \nthe lower lot to show the needful, and it is a question of fact whether such moisture existed on the \nlower lot\u2019s ceiling or ceiling\u2019s finishing material. Thus, a mere allegation on the part of the lower \nlot SP without proof of some dampness or moisture is insufficient to trigger the presumption. \nAssuming this evidential burden is discharged, the legal burden is then placed on the SP of the \nupper lot to prove, on the balance of probabilities, that it is not liable to the lower lot. The phrase \n\u2018in the absence of proof to the contrary\u2019 emphasises the effect of this presumption \u2013 if there is an \nexistence of a ceiling leak but neither party adduces evidence of its source, or the evidence is \nunclear about the nature of the leak\u2019s source, the presumption applies in favour of the Applicant. \nClearly, it is the Respondent who has the legal burden to show \u2018proof to the contrary,\u2019 once the \nevidential burden on the part of the Applicant has been discharged. \nHas there been \u2018any evidence of dampness, moisture or water penetration on the applicant\u2019s ceiling \nor   ceiling\u2019s finishing material\u2019? \n25. Here, the Board was faced with experts from both sides who took opposing views whether there \nwas any evidence of dampness or moisture on the applicant\u2019s ceiling or ceiling\u2019s finishing \nmaterial. In answering this question of fact, the Board is of the view that the Applicant had indeed \n \n4 (LexisNexis, 2019), [17.134]. \n5 STB No. 15 of 1989.    Tan Chin Pei vs Robert Francis De Rozario                        STB No. 99 of 2022 \u2013  Bukit Timah Plaza/Sherwood       \nTowers  \n                                \n \n9 \n discharged her evidentiary burden of showing \u2018evidence of dampness or moisture\u2019 on her ceiling \nand that this was sufficient to trigger the presumption. IGM\u2019s report showed paintwork \ndiscolouration and water stain marks in her kitchen (false) ceiling. This was observed using both \nvisual inspections, as well as radio-wave imaging which registered medium to high moisture \naccumulation at the kitchen concrete ceiling adjoining the kitchen wall (IGM Report, Figs 2.2 and \n2.3). Further, IGM also observed that there was dampness and discolouration of cement observed \nin the bathroom ceiling (above the false ceiling), with radio-wave imaging registering high \nmoisture accumulation within the ceiling when inspecting the bathroom void ceiling space (IGM \nReport, Figs 2.10 and 2.11). Mr. Kumar\u2019s evidence on the use of radio-wave imaging was largely \nleft unscathed in cross-examination. Tellingly, the Respondent\u2019s own expert (who did not see the \nneed to use any equipment to measure the moisture content), also did not challenge or critique the \nuse of IGM\u2019s radio-wave imaging. Thus, after the close of the Applicant\u2019s case, there was certainly \na prima facie  case showing that there was evidence of dampness or moisture on the applicant\u2019s \nceiling (in the bathroom) and ceiling\u2019s finishing material (in the kitchen). \n26. The Board was alive to the possibility that the Respondent\u2019s expert\u2019s evidence could displace the \nApplicant\u2019s evidence of dampness or moisture, even at the evidentiary stage. As mentioned \nhowever, CC\u2019s report merely stated that Mr. Casimir did not observe (visually and to a certain \nextent using his sense of smell) any moisture or dampness. CC did not employ any tools or \ntechnology \u2013 while the Board does not hold that against the Respondent per se, CC did not criticise \nthe use of the tools utilised by IGM in any way; CC\u2019s opinion based on Mr. Casimir\u2019s observations \nrather was that there was no need to use any tools as there was no moisture or dampness on any \nof the applicant\u2019s ceilings or ceiling\u2019s finishing materials. In this vein, the fact that the statutory \nprovision uses the word \u2018any\u2019 is not insignificant. Pitching the thoroughness of the IGM report \nagainst CC\u2019s bare assertions based on Mr. Casimir\u2019s sight and smell meant that the Board would \nbe hard pressed to hold that there was not \u2018 any evidence\u2019 of dampness or moisture on the \nApplicant\u2019s ceiling and ceiling\u2019s finishing material.  \n27. Having concluded that there was evidence of dampness and/or moisture on the Applicant\u2019s ceiling \nand ceiling\u2019s finishing material, the Board held that the statutory presumption under section 101(8) \nof the BMSA does indeed apply in favour of the Applicant. \nII. Has the Respondent rebutted the presumption on the balance of probabilities? \n28. During their respective cross-examinations, both parties questioned the opposing expert why they \nfailed to conduct a water ponding test using fluorescent dye. Indeed, had this test been done, there \nwould have been a good possibility that this would have settled the matter conclusively as the    Tan Chin Pei vs Robert Francis De Rozario                        STB No. 99 of 2022 \u2013  Bukit Timah Plaza/Sherwood       \nTowers  \n                                \n \n10 \n absence or presence of dye in the lower unit speaks for itself. As the Respondent bore the burden \nof proof however, it is insufficient for the Respondent\u2019s expert to merely state that he saw no need \nfor further testing and equipment, relying only on his own senses. The failure by both experts to \nconduct a water ponding test is not ideal, but it is the Respondent who has the legal burden to \ndisprove the presumption, and in failing to conduct such a test, the Respondent could not be said \nto have discharged its legal burden. \n29. The Board also considered CC\u2019s hypotheses that the moisture found in the applicant\u2019s unit may \nhave been attributable to condensate from her air-conditioning piping and rubbish chute \u2013 the \nchute is part of the common property. Taking the case of the Respondent at its highest and even \nassuming these alternate sources of leakages were true however still does not rebut the \npresumption. Given the multiple zones of moisture found in the Applicant\u2019s unit, and the overall \ncondition of the Respondent\u2019s unit (as evidenced from the photographs taken by both the \nApplicant\u2019s and Respondent\u2019s experts), it is possible that there may be more than one source of \nleakage. CC\u2019s report suggesting alternate moisture sources is thus insufficient to displace the \npresumption on the balance of probabilities. \n30. Another point made by Mr. Casimir when he gave evidence in the hearing is that the water spray \ntest conducted by IGM in the Respondent\u2019s toilet was unrelated to the water seen oozing out from \nthe Applicant\u2019s flooring in her kitchen some 1.5 hours later. The Respondent argued that this \nwould mean that the water travelled horizontally for an improbable distance, as the Respondent\u2019s \ntoilet is not immediately above the Applicant\u2019s kitchen. On the other hand, the expert witnesses \nfrom IGM maintained that it was not uncommon for water to travel horizontally before percolating \nto the lower unit. In analysing these facts, the Board was mindful that while the presumption does \nnot apply to lateral water leakages between units, neither is there any necessity for the water from \nthe unit above to flow perfectly vertically to the unit below. Indeed as Mr. Kumar explained during \ncross-examination, water finds the path of least resistance and it is impossible to predict the exact \npath taken by the water as there may be lines of internal weakness in the ceilings, floors, and walls \nof the units. Indeed, the Board considered that while not impossible, the likelihood of the water \nseen oozing on the Applicant\u2019s floor some 1.5 hours after the water spray test being unrelated to \none another is highly improbable. The fact of the water spray test being done and the observed \noozing subsequently, being unchallenged by the Respondent, the Board cannot come to the \nconclusion that the Respondent has rebutted the statutory presumption on the balance of \nprobabilities.    Tan Chin Pei vs Robert Francis De Rozario                        STB No. 99 of 2022 \u2013  Bukit Timah Plaza/Sherwood       \nTowers  \n                                \n \n11 \n III. In the absence of the presumption, has the Applicant nonetheless proven that the cause of \nthe leak in her unit is attributable to the Respondent\u2019s unit?    \n31. As the Board finds that the Applicant has successfully made out her case on reliance of the \nstatutory presumption, there is no need for the Board to consider the third issue, i.e., whether the \nApplicant in the absence of the presumption is nonetheless able to prove that the cause of the leak \nin her unit is attributable to the Respondent\u2019s unit.                        \nBOARD\u2019S DECISION \n32. The Board finds that the Respondent has not rebutted the statutory presumption under section \n101(8) of the BMSA and remains liable to the Applicant. \n33. The Board hereby orders that: \n(A) The Respondent shall engage, at his own cost, within two (2) weeks from the date of this \norder a Building and Construction Authority (BCA) registered building contractor to carry \nout repairs to resolve the water leakage into and water damage caused to the Applicant\u2019s \nunit, to the satisfaction of a building surveyor / water seepage specialist engaged by the \nApplicant provided that such works are as stated in the last three (3) pages of IGM\u2019s \nsupplementary report (\u201c RECOMMENDATION \u201d). \n(B)  Such corrective works shall be completed within ten (10) weeks of the date of this order. \n34. The Applicant claims damages for \u2018inconvenience, anxiety and/or loss of enjoyment\u2019 in the sum \nof $2,000, disbursements of $10,600 inclusive of all STB fees and legal costs of $16,500. \n35. While the Respondent submitted that the Applicant failed to adduce evidence to prove the damages \nsought, the Board notes that in relation to trespass to property and nuisance, there have been \nawards for mental distress and anxiety ( McGregor on Damages , 21st edn, [5-013]). Many of these \ncases relate to the unreasonable behaviour of landlords. In Barr v Biffa Waste Services Ltd  [2012] \nEWCA 312 however concerned itself with a dispute between two neighbours. In that case, the \nEnglish Court of Appeal regarded that disposing of certain pre-treated waste on the defendant\u2019s \nown land, and despite having a waste management permit to do so, was nevertheless an actionable \nnuisance because of the strong odours which emanated. In this case, the leak deemed to originate \nfrom the Respondent\u2019s unit caused nuisance to the Applicant. Indeed, the Board previously \nawarded a sum of $2,500 as damages for \u2018inconvenience, anxiety, and loss of enjoyment\u2019 in Zainal \nAbidin de Silva v Choy Kok Meng  [2021] SGSTB 5 at [37]. There, the Board reduced the sum \nsought for special damages to $2,500 as the Applicants in that case continued to reside in the    Tan Chin Pei vs Robert Francis De Rozario                        STB No. 99 of 2022 \u2013  Bukit Timah Plaza/Sherwood       \nTowers  \n                                \n \n12 \n affected unit and were not deprived of the use of any part of the unit at any time. In this case, the \nBoard notes inter alia, the relatively short period of time (since September 2022) that the Applicant \nhas suffered from the leak, and similarly that the Applicant could continue to reside in her unit. \nPursuant to its jurisdiction under section 101(3) of the BMSA, the Board thus awards $500 to the \nApplicant to mark the anxiety and inconvenience suffered by her. \n36. The Board orders the Respondent to fully reimburse the Applicant the sum of $10,600 for the \nexpert reports and attendance at the hearing, as well as for the STB fees. \n37. In relation to the legal costs sought by the Applicant, the Board awards $7,000 to the Applicant. \nThis is slightly less than what the Respondent sought had he prevailed in the case, and the Board \nnotes its appreciation of the articulate submissions made by Mr. Philip Ling, the lead counsel for \nthe Respondent. In this regard, the reduced costs given to the Applicant also considered the fact \nthat the Respondent had given the Applicant an opportunity, albeit, at the 11th hour, to agree to \njointly appoint a professional building surveyor of her choice, in fulfillment of the Agreement that \nthe parties had signed on 21 December 2021. \n38. Accordingly, apart from ordering the Respondent to comply with the order as stated in paragraph \n33, the Respondent is to pay $18,100 to the Applicant within seven (7) days of this order.  \n \nDated this 23rd day of May 2023 \n ______________________________\n MS LEE LAY SEE  \n Deputy President \n ______________________________ \n DR EDWARD TI \n Member  \n______________________________ \n MR LEE COO \n Member \n \n Mr Daniel Li (M/s Ramdas & Wong) for the Applicant                  \n                                                                  Mr Philip Ling & Ms Patricia Kang (M/s Wong Tan & \nMolly Lim LLC) for the Respondent \n    Ms Michelle Yap Ching Hua as young amicus curiae "

Before the commencement of the hearing, the Applicant sought and was granted leave to amend \nthe orders sought as follows3: \n \n\u201c1) To order the Respondents to make rectifications to unit #XXX to resolve the water seepages in the \nmaster bedroom, second bedroom, and living room of the Applicant\u2019s unit #XXX. \n2) To order the Respondents to pay all of the Applicant\u2019s damages and costs arising out of or in \nconnection with the water seepages in the Applicant\u2019s master bedroom, second bedroom, and living room \n \n1 Form 8 submitted by the Applicant dated 30 March 2022, Section E, page 4. \n2 Form 8, Section D, page 4. \n3 Applicant\u2019s Interlocutory Application to amend Application or other document furnished to a Board (\u201cForm 11\u201d) dated \n5 August 2022. Vivien Chong Ee Mei vs Chew Wee Heong and Woon Lai Leng STB No. 29 of 2022 \u2013 Mount Faber Lodge  \n                                \n \n4 \n including, but not limited to, the loss of rental, claims made by the Applicant\u2019s tenant against the \nApplicant, repairing or replacing damaged properties and areas of the Applicant\u2019s unit, all STB fees, \nbuilding surveyor\u2019s fees, legal fees, and expenses. The Applicant reserves the right to provide the full \nextent of damages and costs incurred at the conclusion of this Application .\u201d \n \nAPPLICANT\u2019S CASE \n \n7. According to the Applicant, the water seepage from the Respondents\u2019 Unit into the Applicant\u2019s \nMaster Bedroom\u2019s ceiling and walls first occurred in late 2014 or early 2015 and had persisted \nthrough the years.  \n \n8. The Applicant therefore filed an application with Strata Titles Boards on 4 April 2022. After 2 \nfailed mediation attempts, the matter proceeded to two (2) days of hearings. \n \n9. The Applicant submits that the Wavescan Micro Holographic Imaging technology (\u201cWavescan\u201d) \nimages from the Wavescan technology produced by the Applicant\u2019s expert, Mr Chin Cheong \n(\u201cMr Chin \u201d) during the joint inspection conducted on 26 and 27 July 2022 with the \nRespondents\u2019 expert Mr Alexander Arditti (\u201c Mr Arditti \u201d) clearly shows there is water seepage \nin the Applicant\u2019s ceiling. \n \n10. The Applicant submits that the presumption under Section 101(8)(a) BMSMA therefore applies \nand Respondents have failed to rebut this presumption.  \n \n11. The Applicant also avers that during the joint water ponding test of 27 July 2022, there is active \nwater seepage of the fluorescent-dyed water clearly egressing from the brickwork column in the \nMaster Bedroom and Living Room. The Applicant opined that the water leaked from the \nRespondent\u2019s balcony into the brickwork column causing water saturation within the column \nand water would egress into the Master Bedroom and living room. This can be seen from the \nWavescan images showing the presence of water within the brickwork column, as submitted by \nthe Applicant. \n \n12. The Applicant seeks damages for the following: \na. Extensive paint debonding and damages: $1,050.00 \nb. Replacement of water heaters: $ 999.00 \nc. Housing agent fees: $ 6,099.00 and $ 5,644.00 \nd. Replacement of aircon compressor and bracket: $ 2,450.00 \ne. Replacement of termite infested door: $ 1,050.00 \n Vivien Chong Ee Mei vs Chew Wee Heong and Woon Lai Leng STB No. 29 of 2022 \u2013 Mount Faber Lodge  \n                                \n \n5 \n  \nRESPONDENTS\u2019 CASE \n \n \n13. The Respondents oppose the Applicant\u2019s Application on the basis that the presumption under \nSection 101(8)(a) BMSMA does not apply as the Applicant did not show dampness, moisture or \nwater penetration on the ceiling. \n \n14. The Respondents take the position that the photographs relied on by Applicant alleging damage \nfrom ceiling onto the floor are irrelevant as they were taken in October 2020 and January 2021. \nThe Respondents submit that these photos, at best, show past damage, but do not show \ndampness/moisture/water penetration on the ceiling of the master bedroom. \n \n15. According to the Respondents, the blue dyed stains are irrelevant as there is no evidence that it \ncame from the water ponding tests in January 2021. Neither parties\u2019 experts investigated the \nblue-dyed stains.  \n \n16. Furthermore, no fluorescent-dyed stains, which was used for the joint water ponding test in July \n2022, was detected in the same area as the alleged blue-dyed stains. Both experts confirmed that \nthe joint water ponding test in July did not show water seepage from the Respondents\u2019 balcony \nto the Applicants\u2019 Unit. In fact, neither expert sighted fluorescent-dyed stains within the \nApplicant\u2019s Unit. \n \n17. The Respondents further submit that the Wavescan images are static and limited to specific areas \nthat Mr Chin selected. They do not show the origins of water or a flow, but at best pockets of \nwater at certain locations.  \n \n18. The Respondents also highlight that the Applicant\u2019s own expert Mr Chin confirmed that there \nwas no water seepage in the 2nd bedroom.  \n \n19. The Respondents also emphasize there is no evidence of water seepage in the living room, which \nis in any event on the 1st floor and not immediately below the Respondents\u2019 Unit.   \n \n20. Respondents submit that even if they are found liable, damages should be nominal as the \nApplicant had failed to prove them.  \n \nBOARD\u2019S FINDINGS  Vivien Chong Ee Mei vs Chew Wee Heong and Woon Lai Leng STB No. 29 of 2022 \u2013 Mount Faber Lodge  \n                                \n \n6 \n  \n21. The issues before the Board are as follows: \n \na. Whether the statutory presumption under Section 101(8)(a) applies in view of the \nallegations of water seepage in the Applicant\u2019s unit which is situated directly below the \nRespondents\u2019 Unit; \nb. If so, whether the Respondents had rebutted the statutory presumption; and if not, whether \nthe Applicant had nevertheless established that the alleged water seepages at the master \nbedroom, second bedroom, and living room of the Applicant\u2019s Unit were caused by a \ndefect in Respondents\u2019 Unit; and \nc. What damages, if any, should the Applicant be entitled to. \n \n22. The Board will examine each of these issues below. \n \na. Whether the presumption under Section 101(8)(a) applies \n \n \n23. The presumption under Section 101(8)(a) applies when there is  any evidence of dampness, \nmoisture or water penetration on the ceiling that forms part of the interior of the lot, common \nproperty or limited common property (as the case may be) immediately below. \n \n24. In this regard, Section 101(8)(a) of the BMSMA provides in relevant part: \n \n\u201c(8) In any proceedings under this section with respect to any alleged defect in a lot or in any \ncommon property or limited common property situated immediately (whether wholly or partly) \nabove another lot or any common property or limited common property, it is presumed, in the \nabsence of proof to the contrary, that the defect is within that lot or common property or limited \ncommon property (as the case may be) above if there is any evidence of dampness, moisture or \nwater penetration \u2014 \n(a) on the ceiling that forms part of the interior of the lot, common property or limited common \nproperty (as the case may be) immediately below;\u2026 \u201d \n \n25. The Board notes that Respondents\u2019 expert Mr Arditti takes the view that although the unit #XXX \nbalcony waterproofing has failed, it has caused water seepage to the external wall/brickwork \ncolumn only. The Board has also examined the reports of the Applicant\u2019s expert Mr Chin and  \n Vivien Chong Ee Mei vs Chew Wee Heong and Woon Lai Leng STB No. 29 of 2022 \u2013 Mount Faber Lodge  \n                                \n \n7 \n Respondents\u2019 expert Mr Arditti and notes that both experts agree that following the joint water \nponding test of 27 July 2022 using the fluorescent-dyed water, there was no fluorescent dyed \nstains inside the Applicant\u2019s Unit at all4.  \n \n26. The Board is not satisfied that the Applicant has established there is any evidence of dampness, \nmoisture or water penetration at the locations complained of in the Applicant\u2019s Unit (i.e. master \nbedroom, second bedroom and living room) as a result of water seepage from Unit #XXX. \n \n27. The Board finds it regrettable that despite the experts\u2019 agreed view that sometimes it takes time \nfor water stains to show, no follow-up inspection was conducted at the Applicant\u2019s Unit after the \nJuly water ponding test even though this was suggested by Respondents\u2019 expert but not agreed \nto by the Applicant\u2019s expert. To-date, the Board has not received any evidence of fluorescent-\ndyed water stains inside the Applicant\u2019s Unit. \n \n28. As such, the Board finds that the statutory presumption under Section 101(8)(a) does not apply. \n \nb. Whether the alleged water seepages at the master bedroom, second bedroom, and living \nroom of the Applicant\u2019s Unit were caused by a defect in Respondents\u2019 Unit \n \n29. The Board also finds that the Applicant has failed to establish that the alleged water seepages  at \nthe master bedroom, second bedroom and living room of the Applicant\u2019s Unit were caused by a \ndefect in the Respondents\u2019 Unit. \n \n30. Water ponding tests are generally used to detect inter-floor water seepage issues, and in this case, \nwas the agreed methodology between both parties\u2019 experts to investigate the alleged inter-floor \nwater seepage issues at the Applicant\u2019s Unit. \n \n31. The Board finds it persuasive therefore that following the joint water ponding test of 27 July \n2022 using the fluorescent dyed water, both parties\u2019 experts agree that there was no fluorescent \ndyed water inside the Applicant\u2019s Unit at all.  \n \n32. Even if the Board considers the Wavescan images, these scans at best only show the presence of \nwater, but did not show the source. The Board also notes that the Wavescan images of the \nApplicant\u2019s Unit was taken only on 26 July 2022 before the joint water ponding test on 27 July \n \n4 AW-2 page 11; RW-3 page 26.  Vivien Chong Ee Mei vs Chew Wee Heong and Woon Lai Leng STB No. 29 of 2022 \u2013 Mount Faber Lodge  \n                                \n \n8 \n 2022, but not after, and as such, there is no basis for any comparison to be made. In any case, the \nBoard accepts Respondents\u2019 submissions that the Wavescan images are static and limited to \nspecific areas selected by Mr Chin. They do not show the origins of water or a flow.  \n \n33. The Board therefore finds that the Wavescan images are of little utility and that the path of the \nwater seepage, if any, therefore cannot be ascertained from the Wavescan images provided.  \n \n34. The Board also accepts Respondents\u2019 submissions that the blue-dyed stains are a red herring. \nAccording to the Applicant, the blue-dyed stains resulted from a water ponding test conducted \non 13 January 2021. However, Respondents had carried out waterproofing works to the balcony \nin Respondents\u2019 Unit on 22 January 2021, and the subsequent water ponding test following the \nwaterproofing works established that there were no more water seepage issues for almost a year \nuntil January 2022.  \n \n35. The Board also finds it pertinent that following the most recent water ponding test conducted in \nJuly 2022, there were no fluorescent dyed water stain in the areas where the blue dyed water \nstains were found. \n \n36. The Board therefore finds that the Applicant has failed to establish that the alleged water \nseepages at the master bedroom, second bedroom, and living room of the Applicant\u2019s Unit were \ncaused by a defect in Respondents\u2019 Unit. \n \n           c. What damages, if any, should the Applicant be entitled to. \n37. In light of the Board\u2019s findings on issues (a) and (b) above, it is not necessary for the Board to \nmake any finding in relation to issue (c).  \n \n38. In any case, the Board finds that the Applicant has failed to establish her entitlement to the \ndamages sought. \n \nBOARD\u2019S DECISION  \n \n39. The Board hereby orders that: \na. Applicant\u2019s application pursuant to Form 8 submitted by the Applicant dated 30 March \n2022 (as amended)  is dismissed; and \nb. The Applicant shall pay the Respondents total costs and disbursements of this Application \nfixed at $7,500.00.

The present dispute concerns the 19 th  Annual General Meeting (\u201c19 th  AGM\u201d) of MCST \nPlan No. 2553, held on 20 th  November 2021. The property forming the setting fo r the \ndispute is Palm Gardens (\u201cthe Property\u201d), a strata title development comprising 695 strata \nlots \u2013 specifically 694 separate residential units and one separate shop unit (the \u201cShop\u201d). \n2.  At the 19 th  AGM, members for the 19 th  Management Council were elected. While 13 \nmembers of the Management Council were elected thro ugh the regular nomination \nprocess, one seat on the Management Council was res erved for Mr Zhang Zhibin (\u201cMr \nZhang\u201d), the subsidiary proprietor of the Shop. Acc ordingly, Mr Zhang became a \nconfirmed member of the Council without having been  nominated. Although not \nformally recorded in the minutes of the 19 th  AGM, it was not disputed by the parties that \na seat on the Management Council was reserved for M r Zhang.  It was also not disputed \nthat the representative of the managing agent who a ssisted in the conduct of the AGM \nadopted the position that the Property was a mixed development and hence Sections \n53(A)(1) and 53(A)2 of the Building Maintenance and  Strata Management Act \n(\u201cBMSMA\u201d) applied. Under these provisions, in a cas e of a mixed development there \nmust be reserved for each class of use at least one  office as member of the council of the \nmanagement corporation.  The owner of the sole comm ercial unit, Mr. Zhang, was \nappointed to the reserved council office. \n3.  The Applicants, being subsidiary proprietors of thr ee residential units in the Property, \nbrought these proceedings against the Respondent th e MCST challenging, inter alia,  the \nreservation of the seat for Mr. Zhang, certain cons equential outcomes of the 19 th  AGM \nand documents to be furnished pursuant to Section 4 7 Building Maintenance and Strata \nManagement Act 2004 (\u201cBMSMA\u201d).  \n4.  During the 19 th  AGM, one of the Applicants, namely Mr. Randy Chiu,  sought to amend \nResolution 10.1. This Resolution was to empower the  Management Council to appoint a \nmanaging agent.  Mr. Chiu proposed at the AGM to am end Resolution 10.1 by inserting \nthe word \u201caccredited\u201d before the words managing age nt. However, Mr. Chiu\u2019s proposal \nto amend the Resolution was disallowed by the Chair man on the basis that the proposal \nwould change the whole intent of the said resolutio n.   \nThe Applicants also sought orders relating to the M CST\u2019s failure to produce various \ndocuments which were requested sometime in October 2021 prior to the 19 th  AGM.  \n \nORDERS SOUGHT BY THE APPLICANTS \n5. The Applicants are seeking the following orders:  \n \n  4 (A)  Order No. 1 \u2013 \nPursuant to Section 103 (1)(a), the Applicants seek  an order from the Board to \ninvalidate the election result of the 19 th  Annual General Meeting (19 th  AGM) of \nMCST 2553, which was held on 20 th  November 2021. \n(B) Order No. 2 - \nPursuant to Section 103 (1)(a) and Order No. 1, the  Applicants seek an order from \nthe Board to direct the Respondents to make immedia te rectification by notifying \neach and every subsidiary proprietor, via notices t o be displayed on the MCST \nnotice boards (physical and electronic) and via let ters mailed by post, that the \nnomination and election proceedings, concluded at t he 19 th  AGM, were in breach \nof Section 53(A)(1) & (2) and Section 61(1). \n(C) Order No. 3 -   \nPursuant to Section 103 (1)(a) and Order Nos. 1 & 2 , the Applicants seek an order \nfrom the Board to direct the Respondents to hold an  Extraordinary General Meeting \n(EOGM) at the first available date & time, no later  than the 30 th  day from the date \nof the order made by the Board, for the purpose of re-nomination and re-election \nof council members to the 19 th  Management Council. \n(D) Order No. 4 - \nPursuant to Section 101 (1)(c), the Applicants seek  an order from the Board to \ndirect that the then-Chairperson, Mr. Eric Ng, who was presiding at the 19 th  AGM \nheld on 20 th  November 2021, had made a completely unwarranted d ecision to \ndisallow an amended proposal made orally at the sai d meeting by one of the \nApplicants, Mr. Randy Chiu, with respect to the mee ting resolution 10.1. Mr. Ng\u2019s \ndecision and actions were completely unwarranted an d constituted a wilful breach \nof Section 1 (4)(b) of the First Schedule. \n(E) Order No. 5 - \nPursuant to Section 101 (1)(c) and Order No. 4, The  Applicants seek an order from \nthe Board to direct the Respondents to make immedia te rectification by conducting \na new tender exercise at the first available date/t ime, no later than the 30 th  day from \nthe date of the order made by the Board, to select and appoint an accredited \nmanaging agent with respect to Resolution 10.1 of t he 19 th  AGM, in accordance \nwith the accreditation schemes that are recognized by the BCA. \n(F) Order No. 6 - \nPursuant to Section 113, the Applicants seek an ord er from the Board to direct the \nRespondents to make available the full list of docu ments to one of the Applicants, \nMr. Randy Chiu, with respect to Mr. Chiu\u2019s applicat ion on 4 th  October 2021 to the \nRespondents made pursuant to Section 47(1)(b)(viii) .  5 (G) Order No. 7 -  \nPursuant to Section 113 and Order No. 6, the Applic ants seek an order from the \nBoard to determine that the Respondents have commit ted a breach to Section 47 \n(2) and Section 56 (d), (e) & (g). \n(H) Order No. 8 - \nPursuant to Section 117 (1), the Applicants seek an  order from the Board to direct \nthat all relevant and incidental costs incurred by the Applicants, with respect to this \napplication, be fully borne by the Respondents.  \n \nISSUES BEFORE THE BOARD \n 6. The 8 Orders sought by the applications can be categorized under 3 issues: \n(1)  The first issue that the Board considered was on th e applicability of Section 53A \nof the BMSMA to the Property. The issue centered on  whether the presence of one \nshop unit, particularly one in the form of a minima rt or a like use, is sufficient to \nrender an otherwise fully residential development t o be a mixed-use development \nfor the purposes of Section 53A BMSMA and hence ent itling the only non-\nresidential subsidiary proprietor an automatic seat  in the Management Council. \n(2)  The second issue was whether the MCST was wrong in disallowing the amendment \nto Resolution 10.1 which was sought by one of the A pplicants to stipulate that only \naccredited managing agents would be eligible for se lection.   \n(3)  The third issue  was  whether the MCST  ought to have furnished the  documents that \nwere requested by the Respondents. The Board was, h owever, informed at the \nhearing of the matter  that the documents which are  in the possession and or control \nof the MCST were being made available to the Respon dents upon payment of the \nprescribed fees. \n \nAPPLICANTS\u2019 CASE \n7.  The Applicants maintained that the Property is not a mixed-use development. Hence, if \nthe Property is not a mixed-use development, Sectio n 53(A) BMSMA would not be \napplicable.  Accordingly, the Applicants maintained  that the Respondents have erred in \nreserving the one seat for Mr. Zhang on the Managem ent Council.  \n8.  The Applicants adduced evidence of the written permission obtained for the \ndevelopment of a condominium on the land \u2013 constitu ting residential use of the land. \nThey also maintained that subsequent approval of an  ancillary shop within the said  6 development does not alter the use of the land from  residential to mixed-use \ncommercial and residential.  \n9.  The Applicants also highlighted the definition of \u201cdevelopment\u201d under Section 3 \nPlanning Act 1998 (\u201cPA\u201d).  \n10.  Section 3 PA, inter alia , states: \n\u201c3 \u2014 (1) Subject to subsections (2) and (3), in thi s Act, except where the context \notherwise requires, \u201cdevelopment\u201d means the carryin g out of any building, \nengineering, mining, earthworks or other operations  in, on, over or under land, \nor the making of any material change in the use of any building or land, and \n\u201cdevelop\u201d and \u201cdeveloping\u201d are to be construed acco rdingly. \n \u2026 \n(2)  The following operations or uses of land are n ot to be deemed for the \npurposes of this Act to involve development of land : \n\u2026. \n(h) in the case of any building or land which is us ed for a purpose of any \nclass specified in any rules made under section 61,  the use of the \nbuilding or land or any part thereof for any other purpose within the \nsame class.\u201d \n11. As regards Section 3 above, the Applicants subm itted that the first Grant of Written \nPermission (\u201cWP 1\u201d), dated 19 th  February 1997, permitted the erection of a \ncondominium housing development, but not the erecti on of a mixed-use development. \nThe Applicants\u2019 witness, AW2, testified that the wr itten permission obtained was for \nthe development of a condominium on the land, which  constitutes residential use of the \nland. In addition, the Applicants also contended th at the URA Space \u2013 Interactive Map \nof the Master Plan also zoned the site of the Prope rty as residential. \n12. AW2\u2019s testimony also referred to the subsequent  Grant of Written Permission (\u201cWP 2\u201d) \ndated 1 st  October 2000. This permitted the subdivision of th e development to include \none shop unit that was specified to be part of the club house. The Applicants maintained \nthat WP 2 was merely an approval for an additional shop unit within the said \ndevelopment and that in itself, did not amount to a  change of use of the land from \nresidential to mixed-use commercial and residential . \n13. The Applicants also relied on the Planning Act \u2013 Master Plan Written Statement 2019. \nThis provides that the competent authority may allo w ancillary or non-residential uses \nin a condominium development without altering its d evelopment class.  \n14. The Applicants also highlighted the guidelines on ancillary shops under the \nDevelopment Control Guidelines of URA. These Guidel ines state, inter alia , that \u201c[a]  7 limited number of units for shops to provide person al services may be allowed in flats \nand condominium developments subject to evaluation. \u201d  \n15. It was also adduced in evidence that following the said AGM, the Applicants wrote to \nthe Building Construction Authority (\u201cBCA\u201d) and Urb an Redevelopment Authority \n(\u201cURA\u201d) to seek clarification on matters related to  the issue in question. Notably, the \nBCA confirmed that Section 53(A) BMSMA only applies  to mixed-use developments, \nand both the BCA and URA unequivocally indicated th at the Property is classified as a \nresidential development. \n16. Based on the foregoing, the Applicants contende d that the Shop is ancillary to the \nresidential estate. This, they reasoned was so, bec ause the shop is meant for the provision \nof personal services to its residents of the Proper ty. Additionally, it was established \nduring the hearing that only residents and their au thorised guests are permitted to enter \nthe condominium. References were also made to Palm Garden\u2019s Handbook which states \nthat the club house, where the Shop is located, is in its entirety a common property for \nthe exclusive use and enjoyment of the residents an d invited guests. In other words, it is \nnot intended to be accessible to the general public .  \n17. The Applicants drew references to the Grant of Written Permissions of neighbouring \ndevelopments, to reiterate their point that the abs ence of the words \u201cmixed development\u201d \nin WP 1 and WP 2 indicates that the Property was no t approved as a mixed-use \ndevelopment.  \n18. The Applicants further adduced in evidence the Commercial Handbook under the \nDevelopment Control Guidelines of URA, which states  that \u201c[t]he residential component \nwithin a mixed commercial and residential developme nt will not be accorded \ncondominium status  as it is not developed in accordance with condomin ium guidelines\u201d \n[ emphasis added].  Therefore, the Applicants submi tted that it would be contradictory to \nthe said Guidelines to categorise the Property as a  mixed-use development. \n19. The Applicants also relied on the decision in Bayfront Realty Pte Ltd v MCST Plan No. \n4404 (\u201c Bayfront Reality \u201d) in support of their case. In Bayfront Realty , a condominium \nhousing development comprising 582 residential unit s and three commercial units was \nheld to be a residential development, instead of a mixed development. \n \nRESPONDENT\u2019S CASE \n20. The Respondent\u2019s position was that the Shop is a commercial unit. The Property is hence \na mixed-use development for the purposes of Section  53A BMSMA. Consequently, \npursuant to Section 53A(4) BMSMA, as the only perso n eligible for election in the \ncommercial class of use, Mr Zhang was rightly allot ted a reserved seat on the \nManagement Council without having to be elected by voting.   8 21. The Respondents also made the following submiss ions. Firstly, that the Shop falls under \nthe category of \u201ccommercial\u201d use specified in Secti on 53A(1)(c) BMSMA.  The \nRespondent further submitted that Section 53A BMSMA  applies, and that it is in \naccordance with Parliamentary intent. Secondly, the  Respondent took issue with the \nApplicant\u2019s arguments premised on the BCA and URA e mails, the comparison with other \nneighbouring developments, and the decision in Bayfront Realty .  \n22. The Respondents in their submissions highlighte d that under WP 2, the Shop was \napproved for use as a minimart under the Planning A ct. Later it was granted temporary \npermission for change of use from a minimart to a p izza making and delivery outlet for \na period of three years.  Mr Zhang\u2019s resolution at the 19 th  AGM for the MCST\u2019s approval \nto change the use of his shop was rejected, the Sho p has remained as a minimart. The \nRespondent therefore maintained that irrespective o f whether the Shop is a minimart or \na pizza making and delivery outlet, its use is stil l commercial in nature, and it falls under \na separate class of use from the other residential units. The Respondent further \nmaintained that the Property has strata lots author ised by the URA for two classes of use \nspecified under Sections 53A(1) BMSMA \u2013 residential  units (Section 53A(1)(a) \nBMSMA), and a commercial unit (Section 53A(1)(c) BM SMA). Consequently, the \nRespondent has argued that the Property is a mixed- use development for the purposes of \nSection 53A BMSMA. \n23. The Respondents additionally submitted that thi s interpretation of Section 53A BMSMA \nis also consistent with the Parliamentary intent un derlying its enactment \u2013 to give a voice \nto subsidiary proprietors of different classes of u se, especially when they are the minority \nin a strata development. This would address problem s of the underrepresentation of \nparticular classes of use on the Management Council .  \n24.  As regards the email correspondences from BCA and URA to the Applicants, the \nRespondent submitted that these emails are merely o pinions of the Authorities. \nAccordingly, the Board is not obliged to act in acc ordance with them. Additionally, the \nRespondent also raised the issue of the URA not hav ing a category for Mixed-use \ndevelopments, to argue that the zoning categories u nder the URA Master Plan differ from \nwhat is contemplated under the BMSMA. It was conten ded that the URA Master Plan \nwas never meant to fetter the Authorities\u2019 power to  approve a use of land differing from \nwhat the land in question is zoned as. Therefore, l and zoned residential may be used for \na different class of use, as long as such use is ap proved under the Planning Act. The \nRespondent also highlighted that notwithstanding it s zoning, the land in question may be \nused for other uses that are ancillary, related or compatible with the permissible \npredominant use.  \n25. The Respondent also wrote to the BCA. Notably B CA in their reply did not state that \nSection 53A BMSMA is not applicable in the case of the Property. Instead, the BCA \ninstructed the Respondent to ascertain the class of  use corresponding to the Shop with \nreference to the Grant of Written Permission. From this response, the Respondent \nattempted to reinforce its argument that the approv ed use of the Shop as a minimart or \npizza making and delivery outlet constitutes commer cial use.   9 26. Regarding the neighbouring developments, in res pect of two of the properties cited by \nthe Appellants, the Respondent has argued that the interests of subsidiary proprietors \nengaged in different classes of use have already be en protected by Section 80 BMSMA, \non account of the two-tier MCST operating within th ose properties. For the remaining \nproperty with a single-tier MCST, the Respondent ha s asserted that Section 53A \nBMSMA should operate to protect the interests of su bsidiary proprietors engaged in \ndifferent classes of use.  \n27. On the Bayfront Reality case , the Respondent has argued that judgment in that c ase \nturned on a different issue altogether. It has take n the position that the Board did not \nmake a finding on whether Section 53A BMSMA was app licable, but merely stated that \nthe property in question was a residential developm ent and not a \u201cmixed development\u201d.  \n28. Lastly, the Respondent submitted that having di fferent classes of use in the same \ndevelopment is not uncommon, notwithstanding the fa ct that an area of land may be \nzoned residential or commercial. To substantiate th is, the Respondent cited examples of \ncondominiums with shops, cafes and commercial schoo ls permitted under the Planning \nAct, in areas zoned residential. The Respondent als o highlighted developments zoned \ncommercial with different classes of use present wi thin each of them.  \n \nBOARD\u2019S FINDINGS  \nThe Board\u2019s findings are as follows:  \n29. Sections 53(A) and 53A(1) BMSMA apply to a parc el in a strata title plan consisting of \nbuildings authorised under the Planning Act 1998 fo r 2 or more of the stated classes of \nuse. Such classes include residential and commercia l use.  Examples of commercial use \nwould include the operation of a shop, food establi shment or theatre. Section 53A(2) \nshows that such a parcel as detailed under Section 53A(1) is a \u201cmixed-use development\u201d. \nThe definition of a \u201cmixed-use development\u201d under S ection 2(1) of the Building \nMaintenance and Strata Management (Strata Units) Re gulations 2005 (\u201cBMSMA (Strata \nUnits) Regulations\u201d) is substantially similar to Se ction 53A(1) and reads : \u201c a \ndevelopment that consists or is to consist of 2 or more different classes of use \u201d. The \nclasses of use under the BMSMA (Strata Units) Regul ations are also substantially similar \nto those stated in Section 53A(1) BMSMA, and need n ot be distinguished for present \npurposes.  \n30. The Board did not agree with the Respondent\u2019s s ubmission that the presence of both \nresidential units and a commercial unit in the Prop erty would render it a mixed-use \ndevelopment for the purposes of Section 53A BMSMA.  The Board noted that the statute \ndoes not specify the requisite number of lots or un its for the constitution of a different \nclass of use, or even whether there is a minimum sc ale required. Against this context, the \noverarching issue to be addressed is thus whether t he presence of one shop unit, \nparticularly one in the form of a minimart or a piz za making and delivery outlet, is \nsufficient to render an otherwise fully residential  development a mixed-use development  10 for the purposes of Section 53A BMSMA. Based on the  facts before us, the Board was \nof the view that the Property is not a mixed develo pment. \n31. The Board agreed with the submission of the App licants that the grant of written \npermission is a pre-condition for a development to be a mixed-use development. \nHowever, the presence of such permission does not n ecessarily mean that a development \nis a mixed-use one. As mentioned above, Section 53A  applies in relation to a parcel in a \nstrata title plan \u201cconsisting of buildings authorised under the Planning Act 1998  for 2 or \nmore of the [stated] classes of use\u201d [ emphasis added ].  Hence, the grant of written \npermission does not in itself resolve the ambiguity  surrounding the requisite scale of a \ndistinct use for a given development to be regarded  as mixed-use. \n32. The Board also noted that although the BMSMA is  administered by the Commissioner \nof Buildings of the BCA, the BCA itself does not ap pear to have an independent authority \non use or zoning of land. The absence of such autho rity is unsurprising as land use \nplanning falls under the purview of the URA. Hence,  any examination of land zoning \nshould be conducted with reference to the Master Pl an published by the URA.  \n33. The Board also considered the replies that the Applicants received from both BCA and \nURA following the 19 th  AGM. Both the authorities unambiguously stated tha t the \nProperty is classified as a residential development . Notably, BCA in its reply also \nhighlighted that 53(A) of the BMSMA only applies to  mixed-use development.   \n34. The Board also agreed that in line with these p rinciples, the applicable guidelines for \ncondominium developments on land zoned \u201cResidential \u201d indicate that shops are only \npermitted to operate in such developments under lim ited circumstances. Such shops, \nknown as \u201cancillary shops\u201d, are limited to a maximu m of 0.3% of the proposed \nresidential gross floor area, and may only engage i n personal service trades, such as that \nof a mini-mart or laundromat business. Independent offices are not allowed. Further, the \npermissibility of such a shop\u2019s operation hinges on  considerations such as the character \nof the surrounding developments, and the planning i ntention of the surrounding area. It \nwas established at the hearing that only residents and their authorised guests are permitted \nto enter the condominium. As the shop is not open t o the public, the Respondent\u2019s \ncontention that the Property is a mixed-used develo pment is not supported.   \n35. The Respondent sought to cast doubt on the sign ificance of URA\u2019s zoning categories in \nthe present case, by observing that a mixed-use dev elopment under the BMSMA could \nbe developed on land zoned \u201cCommercial\u201d by the URA and arguing that the URA\u2019s \nzoning categories consequently differ from what is contemplated under the BMSMA. In \nso doing, the Respondent has sought to dismiss the URA\u2019s and BCA\u2019s recognition of the \nProperty as a residential development. However, the  URA\u2019s zoning categories expressly \nprovide for the development of \u201cmixed commercial an d residential developments\u201d on \nland zoned \u201cCommercial and Residential\u201d or \u201cCommerc ial\u201d. Hence, rather than \nunderstanding the URA\u2019s zoning categories as being entirely different from the \ncategories contemplated under the BMSMA, it is best  to understand the URA\u2019s system \nas having allocated mixed-use developments to these  two categories instead. Such an  11 understanding, then, would render the URA\u2019s recogni tion of the Property as a residential \ndevelopment to be significant, especially in light of its situation on land zoned \n\u201cResidential\u201d, from which mixed commercial and resi dential developments have been \nexcluded. Separately, the Board also noted that the re is no meaningful distinction \nbetween \u201cmixed-use developments\u201d and \u201cmixed develop ments\u201d, contrary to the \nRespondent\u2019s case. \n36. In summary, Section 53A BMSMA only applies to m ixed-use developments. Since the \nProperty is not a mixed-use development, Section 53 A BMSMA does not apply and there \nis no reserved seat for the owner of the commercial  unit to sit in the Management Council. \nThe applicable section in such a case would be Sect ion 53 BMSMA, which has no \nprovision for reserved seats. Section 53(4) states that \u201c[a]ll the members of the council \nof a management corporation must be elected at each  annual general meeting of the \nmanagement corporation.\u201d The other provisions only contain stipulations on the parties \nineligible for election as members of the Council, rather than stipulating any parties that \nmust be elected.  \n37. On the second issue of the proposed amendment t o the Resolution 10.1 which was \ndisallowed at the 19 th  AGM, the Board took the view that the proposed ame ndment to \nthat resolution by adding the words \u201caccredited\u201d di d not alter the substance of the \nResolution that was original proposed and circulate d to the subsidiary proprietors.  \n38. Any proposal to amend a Resolution at a meeting  prior to the passing of the Resolution \nmay be undertaken with a qualified person proposing  the motion to amend. This proposal \nmust then be seconded by another qualified person. This process was not followed during \nthe 19 th  AGM.  \n39. The Board was also of the view that the substan ce of the amendment to have an accredited \nmanaging agent would not be detrimental in any way to the subsidiary proprietors. The \nBoard also agreed with the submission that Mr. Joe Oh of the managing agent was also \nin a position of conflict when he advised the presi ding chairman Mr. Eric Ng on the ruling \non the proposed amendment of Resolution 10.1. This is on account of the fact that the \nmanaging agent, Smart Property Management Pte Ltd, was at the material time not an \naccredited managing agent. Mr. Joe Oh ought to have  disqualified himself from advising \nMr. Eric Ng given that he was an employee of an una ccredited managing agent.  \n40. On the third issue as previously mentioned, it was brought to the Board\u2019s attention that \nall the documents in the possession and control of the MCST are now available to the \nApplicants upon the payment of the prescribed fee.  \n \nBOARD\u2019S DECISION \n41. As regards the various Orders sought by the App licants the Board\u2019s decision is as follows:  \n  12 (A)     Order No: 1  \nThe Board finds that the decision to entitle Mr Zha ng to the reserved council seat \nis wrong in law as Section 53(A) BMSMA does not app ly. No reserved seat is \npermitted as the Property is not a mixed developmen t. Mr Zhang does not have \nautomatic right to be on the council and his appoin tment should therefore be \ninvalidated. Therefore, he must cease with immediat e effect to be a member of the \ncouncil. The existing council members can continue to operate and manage the \nProperty without the need to call for an election t o fill the vacancy and this will not \nbe detrimental in any way to the management of the Property, although they are at \nliberty to do so.  \n (B) Order No: 2  \nAs regards to the Applicants\u2019 2 nd  order sought, the Board makes no order. This \nGrounds of Decision, which is a public document is accessible to all. This would \nmore than sufficiently address the concerns raised in Prayer 2. \n (C) Orders No: 3 and 4 \nThe Board is fully in agreement with the Applicants  that the council has erred in \nreserving the seat for Mr Zhang. However, the Board  notes that the current office \nbearers\u2019 term will expire on 24 September 2022, and  it would be a waste of time, \neffort and money to call for an EOGM to elect a rep lacement for Mr Zhang, \nalthough they are at liberty to do so. As such, the  Board will decline the application \nto order a replacement for Mr Zhang. The Board make s no order on Prayers 3 & 4. \n (D) Order No: 5 \nThe Board finds that the decision not to allow an a mendment to the Resolution 10.1 \nby inserting a requirement that the proposed managi ng agent must be accredited \ndid not comply with the due process which is applic able to meetings. The fact that \nSmart Property Management Pte Ltd was granted accre dited status by the \nassociation of strata managers on 29 June 2022 was irrelevant as it cannot have \nretrospective effect. However, although the Board w as in full agreement with the \nApplicants on this irregularity, it will not grant the order requested, i.e. that a new \ntender be conducted in accordance with the accredit ation scheme recognised by the \nBCA. Accordingly, the Board will make no order on P rayer 5. \n (E) Order Nos: 6 and 7 \nThe Board finds that the Respondents have failed in  their obligations to comply \nwith the requirement to furnish the documents sough t. As these documents have \nsince been made available and if in the event any o f the documents have not been \nprovided, the Respondent shall supply such document s within 14 days on payment \nof the prescribed fees by the Applicants.   13  (F) Order No: 8  \nThe Applicants are justifiably aggrieved by the man ner in which the AGM was \nconducted. The Board having heard parties on costs,  order that the Respondent to \npay the Applicants a total sum of $1,600.00.  \n \nDated this 11 th  day of August 2022 \n \n    \n ______________________________ \n MR ALFONSO ANG  \n President \n \n \n ________________________________ \n MR TAN KIAN HOON \n Member \n           \n       \n________________________________ \n  MR RAJARAM RAMIAH \n       Member \n \n                      Randy Chiu C K for the Applic ants.      \n                  Toh Kok Seng (M/s Lee & Lee) for the Respondent. \n                           Desiree Chong Ci En as y oung amicus curiae. \n "

The Applicant is the management corporation of  the development known as Skies \nMiltonia ( \u201cDevelopment \u201d).         \nThe Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 4407    STB No. 45 of 20 21 (Skies Miltonia)  \nv Lin Meiyi Sophie  \n \nPage 3 of 24 \n 2. The Respondent  is the subsidiary proprietor of one of the penthouse units in the \nDevelopment at Block 33, Unit # XXX , Singapore 768064 (the \u201c Unit \u201d).  By way of a \npower of attorney, t he Respondent  was represented by her father Mr Victor Lim in these \nproceedings.   \nEarlier  proceedings  \n3. The substantive dispute is over the works and structures that the Respondent has erected \nat the lower roof terrace of her Unit and the open terrace outside the Respondent\u2019s \nstudy/family room sometime in 2018  (AWS Tab 9) , and whether the Respondent should \nbe allowed to retain the same. It is the Applicant\u2019s case that these works are unauthori sed \nin that no proper approval has been sought nor granted by the MCST  or relevant \nauthorities.  \n4. For clarity, the Board will refer to the alleged unauthorised works as set out in the \nApplicant\u2019s Interlocutory Application to Amend dated 7 January 2022, and the \nworks/structures that the Applicant has identified to -date shall collectively be referred to \nas the \u201c Respondent\u2019s Works/Structures \u201d.  \n5. The Board notes that the renovation works erecting the Respondent\u2019s  Works/Structures \nwere done in 2018, and since then, the Respondent and/or her father have appeared \nmultiple times before the Strata Titles Board s as well as the Courts on this issue .   \n6. Given the long history between parties, it is appropriate to revisit in brief the sequence \nof events that have led parties to these proceedings : \n(a) On 24 October 2012, the Respondent signed  a Sale & Purchase Agreement \npurchasing the Unit from the developers.  Notably, and as pointed out by the \nApplicant, she acknowledges that she is not allowed to enclose the open t o sky \nareas of the Unit without prio r written approval from the relevant authorities and \nthe MCST (see clause 22E and also clauses 22A, 22D , 22G of Sale & Purchase \nAgreement ).   \n(b) On 10 November 2017, the 1st Management Council of the MCST held its 2nd \ncouncil meeting.  The minutes (exhibited in the Applicant\u2019s Written Submissions \n(\u201cAWS \u201d) Tab  14) state that the Management Council had ratified the information \nprovided by the developer regarding the approved and utilized gross floor area for         \nThe Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 4407    STB No. 45 of 20 21 (Skies Miltonia)  \nv Lin Meiyi Sophie  \n \nPage 4 of 24 \n the Developme nt, and noted that \u201c Skies Miltonia has fully utilized the GFA allotted \nfor the site\u201d.   The Respondent\u2019s father Mr Victor Lim was Chairman of the \nManagement Council at the time and was in attendance at the said meeting.  \n(c) On 27 November 2017 and 23 January 2 018, the Respondent submit ted 3 plans to \nURA for approval to build what is described as a \u201c Proposed Roof Covering to \nexisting balcony and roof terrace \u201d of her Unit.  URA gave condition al approval  by \nway of a Grant of Written Permission dated 25 January 2017  (this appears to be a \nclerical error and should be dated 2018) ; the approval was  subject to conditions \ninter alia that there would be no increase in gross floor area, and that the private \nroof terrace and balcony areas were to remain open -sided, and not enclosed ( AWS  \nTab 10).   \n(d) The Respondent proceeded with her renovation works thereafter .  It then came to \nthe attention of the other subsidiary proprietors of the Development that the \nRespondent w as proceeding with extensive renovation works at her Unit for which \nno approvals had been sought  from the MCST .  \n(e) Accordingly, o n or around 11 January 2019, Mr Harry Ho, a subsidiary proprietor \nand the developer\u2019s representative filed STB 5  of 2019 against the management \ncorporation of the Development (\u201c MCST \u201d) (of which the Management Council \nwas then helmed by Mr Victor Lim as chairman) for inter alia  disclosure of \ndocuments relating to the Unit\u2019s renovation works.   \nIn STB 5  of 2019, it was alleged that the Respondent had failed to obtain the \nnecessary renovation approvals from the Applicant, or URA before the proceeding \nwith the Respondent\u2019s  Works/Structures.  In addition, that the Respondent\u2019s  \nWorks/Structures had caused an increase i n the gross floor area of the Development.  \n(f) Belatedly, among documents that were disclosed by  the MCST post filing of the \nproceedings in STB 5  of 2019 , a renovation form submitted on behalf of the \nRespondent to the MCST dated 26 March 2018  was also produced .  The renovation \nform had a scanty description of the concluded or intended works, which \ndescription read \u201c Installation of ACT canopy on  steel structure on roof terrace \u201d \n(\u201c2018 Renovation Form \u201d).   Further descriptions of the intended wo rks were also \nset out in the Respondent\u2019s letters to the MCST on 5 March 2018 and 16 September \n2018.           \nThe Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 4407    STB No. 45 of 20 21 (Skies Miltonia)  \nv Lin Meiyi Sophie  \n \nPage 5 of 24 \n (g) On conclusion of the Respondent\u2019s renovation works however, it became apparent \nthat what the Respondent had carried out was clearly more extensive than what was \ndescribed in the 2018 Renovation Form and in the subsequent letters to the MCST, \nor even as indicated in the original plans submitted to URA.   \n(h) On or about 6 August 2019, four subsidiary proprietors in the Development filed \nSTB 75 of 2019 against  the Respondent and her father Mr Victor Lim to dismantle \nthe \u2018Unauthorised  works\u2019 in the Respondent\u2019s Lot.  \nThese Unauthorised  works were identified in a letter dated 26 April 2019 from \nvarious subsidiary proprietors to the  MCST as the following:  \n\u201ca. Enclosing the sides of the roof, resulting in an increase in the Unit\u2019s gross floor \narea at the expense of the allo cated gross floo r area of the entire condominium;  \nb. erecting a build -up supporting wall for the roof that is sitting on the common \nboundary wall, thereby encroaching on the common boundary;  \nc. extending the roof eave beyond the boundary line, thereby encroaching on the  \ncommon boundary;  \nd. hacking into the reinforced concrete party wall;  \ne. partially enclosing the yard with louvers and glass panels windows, resulting in \nthe covering of more than 50% of the ventilated areas when the windows are \nfully closed; and.  \n\u2026 \nUnauthorised discharge of condensate water into the common area.\u201d  \nThis application was eventually withdrawn pursuant to a written undertaking given \nby the respondents in STB 75  of 2019 (through Mr Victor Lim) that the said \n\u2018Unauthorised  works\u2019 would be rem oved as soon as the Lighting Protection System \n(\u201cLPS\u201d) was rectified , and that he (presumably in his capacity as then -Chairman \nof the Management Council) would expedite the rectification of the LPS.   \n(i) On or about 31 July 2020, the MCST informed the Respondent and her father, that \nthe developer had sent the PE certification for Block 33 where the Respondent\u2019 s \nUnit was located.  In addition, that \u201cLPS rectification works has been completed \nand they were c ertified in compliant (sic) with the Code of Practice for Lightning         \nThe Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 4407    STB No. 45 of 20 21 (Skies Miltonia)  \nv Lin Meiyi Sophie  \n \nPage 6 of 24 \n Protection SS 555:2010.  The BCA comments made on 13 July 2020 has been \nresponded and BCA has no further comments on the LPS matter.\u201d   \nNotwithstanding the certification and BCA\u2019s position  on the LPS , the Board notes \nthat the Respondent\u2019s father appeared to disagree that this was sufficient for his \npurposes, and maintained that he was unable to accept the above as it was \u201c not in \nline with the good LPS presentations made by ER Tan to the bui lding industries \naround Feb 2018 \u201d.   \n(j) The MCST then wrote to the Respondent and her father on 28 August 2020 and 9 \nOctober 2020 demanding that they comply with their written undertaking given in \nSTB 75  of 2019.  The Respondent made little or no attempt to comply with this \nwritten undertaking.  \n(k) For completen ess, we note that the Respondent has alleged in the course of these \nproceedings that the glass sliding doors in her Unit had been removed on 4 October \n2019 pursuant to this written undertaking or otherwise.  Further, that the Applicant \nshould have been awa re of this, inter alia, when the MCST\u2019s representatives visited \nthe roof of the Unit on various occasions, and lastly when the Respondent informed \nthe Applicant of this at the interlocutory hearing on 15 February 2022.  We \nelaborate on this below.  \n(l) The Respondent and her father Mr Victor Lim  proceeded to file STB 54  of 2020 \non 14 September 2020  against the Applicant for various orders.  The nub of the \nOrders sought pertained to the LPS .  As it is apparent that the Respondent and her \nfather were of the vi ew that the \u2018correct\u2019 LPS Code of Practice that should apply to \nthe Development was the SSS 55:2018 (\u201c2018 Code \u201d) rather than SS 555:2010  \n(\u201c2010 Code \u201d), the Respondent and her father sought orders demanding that the \nApplicant reject the rectification works done by the developer to the LPS in \naccordance with the 2010  Code , and sought orders compelling the Applicant to \ninstead do what was necessary to ensure  that the LPS of the Development was in \naccordance with the 2018  Code . \n(m) In its ground s of decision dated 23 April  2021, the Board in STB 54  of 2020 \nconclusively found that the code of practice applicable to the Development was the \n2010 Code and not the 2018  Code.  Notably, the Respondent\u2019s own expert ER Pam \nhad accepted and conceded in cross -examination that the \u201c BCA is the authority and         \nThe Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 4407    STB No. 45 of 20 21 (Skies Miltonia)  \nv Lin Meiyi Sophie  \n \nPage 7 of 24 \n has the final say whether to accept the certifications.  BCA\u2019s acceptance of the \ncertifications [by Er Lee. that the recti fication works done to the LPS, and the LPS \nitself, complied with the 2010 Code] is a decision  that is best left to that competent \nauthority.\u201d    \nThe Board further notes that the Board in STB 54  of 2020 had specifically \ndismissed the prayer that the Respondent and her father, be allowed to retain the \nroof and the Respondent and her father were reminded that having given an \nundertaking, which led to the withdrawal of STB 75  of 2019, they should properly \nabide by the same.  \n(n) Shortly after, on 26 April 20 21, the Applicant filed these proceedings STB 45  of \n2021 to compel the Respondent to remove the Respondent\u2019s  Works/Structures.  \n(o) Concurrently, the Respondent and her father appealed to the General Division of \nthe High Court on 18 May 2021 inter alia seeking  to set aside the orders made in \nSTB 54 of 2020 by way of HC/TA 12/2021.  \n(p) HC/TA 12/21 was dismissed on 27 August 2021 and we note that Maniam JC (as \nhe then  was) had rejected the Respondent and her father\u2019s request for further \narguments on 13 September 2021.  \n(q) Still dissatisfied, the Respondent and her father applied for leave to appeal to the \nAppellate Division of the High Court  vide AD/OS 48 /2021 and this application was \ndismissed on 6 December 2021.  We highlight that the Honou rable Quentin Loh \nJAD and See Kee Oon J had in their judgment recorded ,  \n(2) \u2026 \u201cIt is clear beyond peradventure  that the circular  (\u201cthe Circular\u201d)  which \naccompanied the 2018 Code did not provide for the 2018 Code to supersede \nthe 2010 Code.  O n the contrary , the Circular made it explicitly clear that the \n2018 Code would apply only to developments whose buildings plans were \nsubmitted on or after 1 May 2019 .  It is undisputed that the building plans for \nthe Development were submitted before 1 May 2019.  \n(3) For completeness, we also do not consider either the Judge or the Strata Titles \nBoard (\u201cSTB\u201d) to have erred in their reasoning and decision\u2026\u201d  [emphasis \nadded ].         \nThe Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 4407    STB No. 45 of 20 21 (Skies Miltonia)  \nv Lin Meiyi Sophie  \n \nPage 8 of 24 \n (r) In view of the proceedings vide HC/TA 12/21 and AD/OS 48/2021, STB 45  of 2021 was \nstayed twice.  We note that the Respondent and her father have  exhausted all avenues of \nappeal on this issue and the issue of which Code applies and whether it is safe and \nappropriate for such Code to apply, should be regarded as res judicata.   The Appellate \nDivision has made clear (if it were not already apparent previously) that it is the 2010 \nCode that should apply to the Development .   \nOrders sought by Applicant  \n7. The Orders sought by the Applicant, as amended by the Applicant\u2019s Interlocutory \nApplication to Amend dated 7 January 2 022, which amendments were allowed by the \nBoard on 15 February 2022  are as follows:  \n\u201c1 (i)  The Respondent be ordered to remove the unauthorized roof shelter shown  \n  at Tab 12 of the Application)  constructed over the entire lower roof terrace \n  of her penthouse located at Block 33 # XXX  including the unauthorized  \n  enclosures shown in Tab 13 -17 of the Application namely. the aluminium \n  framed glass panel resting at the edge of a party wall, the l ouvre facade \n  concealing the enclosed space and air conditioner compressor, a glass \n  sliding door (Tab 40 of the Application) and any other unauthorized  \n  structures found to have been installed to enclose the entire lower roof \n  terrace;  \n(ii) The Respondent  be ordered to remove an extension built on top of an \nexisting boundary wall ( Tab 62 of the Application ) separating her strata lot \nfrom the common property;  \n(iii) The Respondent be ordered to remove a shelter installed over a steel trellis; \n(Tab 13 and Tab 17 of  the Application ) \n(iv) The Respondent be ordered to remove all pipings and electrical cables \nconcealed in  a channel hacked into a party wall to conceal air conditioner \ndrainage pipes and electrical cables and to take steps to ensure air \nconditioner condensates is not drained onto the common area ; (Tab 15, 16 \nand 62 of the Application )         \nThe Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 4407    STB No. 45 of 20 21 (Skies Miltonia)  \nv Lin Meiyi Sophie  \n \nPage 9 of 24 \n (v) The Respondent be ordered to remove the glass sliding door and side \nlouvres installed at the open terrace of her family/study room; ( Tab 18 and \nTab 19 of the Applicatio n) and  \n(vi) Where works were carried out as described above the Respondent be \nordered to restore it to its original state.  \nAll these orders applied for shall hereinafter be described collectively as \n\u201cunauthorized works\u201d  where changes were made to existing struc tures and \n\u201cunauthorized structures\u201d  where additional structures were built and added to \nexisting structures.  \n2. The Respondent shall allow and pay for the engagement of a professional engineer \nto be appointed by the MCST to conduct an audit of the restoration  work as well as \nto certify the fitness of work carried out to restore it to its original state.  \n3. Costs of this Application to be provided for. \u201d \n(N.B: Counsel for the Applicant has clarified that references to \u201cTab\u201d above refer instead \nto \u201cPage\u201d and the numbers that follow are page numbers)  \nIssues before the Board  \n8. The issues before the Board for determination are as follows:  \n(a) Whether the alleged Respondent\u2019s  Works/Structures are indeed Unauthorised ; \n(b) Even if the alleged Respondent\u2019s  Works/Structures are indeed Unauthorised , \nwhether there  are other considerations the Board should take into account;  and \n(c) Following from the above, whether the Board should order the removal of the \nRespondent\u2019s  Works/Structures.  \n9. For completeness, we note that there were several preliminary objections raised by the \nRespondent and we deal with these briefly:   \n(a) Whether the application has been filed with reference to the correct provisions in \nthe Building Maintenance and Strata Manag ement Act (\u201c BMSMA \u201d) and/or \nwhether the Applicant has failed to make out its case;  \n(b) Consequently, whether the burden of proof lies on the Applicant to make out its \ncase and what is the burden of proof required ; and          \nThe Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 4407    STB No. 45 of 20 21 (Skies Miltonia)  \nv Lin Meiyi Sophie  \n \nPage 10 of 24 \n (c) Whether the Application is frivolous , vexatious and/or brought in abuse of process, \nand so therefore should be dismissed.  \nReference provision in BMSMA  \n10. The Applicati on has been brought pursuant to section 101 of the BMSMA.  At the hearing \non 19 April 2022 and by way of the Respondent \u2019s Closing Submissions dated on 4 May \n2022 (\u201c RCS \u201d), the Respondent has sought to allege that this  is the incorrect provision \nand/or that the Applicant has failed to make out its case pursuant to section 101.  \n11. Section 101, specifically section 101 (1)(c) of the BMSMA provides,  \n\u201cSubject to subsections  (4), (6) and (7), a Board may, pursuant to an application by a \nmanagement corporation or subsidiary management corporation, a subsidiary \nproprietor, mortgagee in possession, les see or occupier of a lot in a subdivided building, \nmake an order for the settlement of a dispute, or the rectification of a complaint, with \nrespect to   \n\u2026 \n(c) the exercise or performance of, or the failure to exercise or perform, a power, duty \nor function conferred or imposed by this Act or the by -laws relating to the subdivided \nbuilding or limited common property, as the case may be.\u201d   \n12. The Applicant\u2019s position as set out in its Further Written Submissions (for ease of \nreference referred to as the  Applicant\u2019s Closing Submissions (\u201c ACS\u201d )) is that there is a \ndispute between the Applicant and the Respondent over the Respondent\u2019s alleged \ninfringement of the BMSMA and the by -laws of the Development  in proceeding with the \nRespondent\u2019s  Works/Structures without the requisite approvals from either the Applicant \nor the relevant regulatory authorities .   \n13. The Applicant goes on to cite section 29(1)(a) of the BMSMA which empowers it to \n\u201ccontrol, manage and administer \u201d the common property of th e Development and section \n29(2)(b) of the BMSMA which empowers it to \u201cdo all things reasonably necessary for \nthe performance of its duties \u2026 and for the enforcement of the by -laws\u201d.   In commencing \nthese proceedings therefore, the Applicant takes the position that it is seeking to take the \nRespondent to task for failing to comply with the BMSMA and relevant by -laws.          \nThe Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 4407    STB No. 45 of 20 21 (Skies Miltonia)  \nv Lin Meiyi Sophie  \n \nPage 11 of 24 \n 14. The Board agrees with the Applicant\u2019s position and is of the view that  the application \nhas been properly commenced pursuant to section 101 (1)(c) of the BMSMA.  \nBurden of proof  \n15. After the hearing on 19 April 2022, the Board invited parties to submit on the legal and \nevidential burden of proof in this application.  Parties have taken rather disparate \npositions on this.   \n16. With reference to the Court of Appeal case of Ng Eng Ghee and others v Mamata \nKapildev Dave [2009] 3 SLR(R) 109 (\u201c Horizon Towers \u201d), the Applicant has sought to \npersuade the Board that the Board is e xercising an inquisitorial jurisdiction over the \nproceedings , and as a result, \u201cneither party bears a burden of proof \u201d. The Board notes \nthat Horizon Towers is a case relating to an appeal arising from an arbitration heard by \nthe STB on collective or \u201c en bloc\u201d sales.  \n17. Generally, the Singapore judicial system, being under a common law system of \njurisprudence , adopts an adversarial rather than inquisitorial approach.  The Board is of \nthe view t he relevant extracts from the Horizon Towers case (at [172] to [1 75]) were \nintended to convey that for collective or en bloc  cases, the STB had to play a more \nproactive role  at an arbitration \u201c in the event that mediation has failed \u201d ([173]) , and it was \nnot sufficient for the Board to only rely on what parties had put forward, as in the case \nof a traditional adversarial approach. In fact, (at [174 and 175]) the Court of Appeal drew \nan important distinction between the types of STB proceedings ; those  affecting private \nrights  (\u201cto the extent that the STB\u2019s decisions affect the interests of contending subsidiary \nproprietors, proceedings before the STB may be said to be analogous to private \nlitigation \u201d) and those concer ning a \u201c wider public interest  involved in the implementation \nof the collective sale scheme \u201d, with the latter justifying  a more inquisitorial role .  It is \nalso important to put the Horizon Towers case in its proper perspective, that since the \namendments to the Land Titles (Strata) Act  in 2010, the STB\u2019s role in collective sale \ncases have been limited only to mediation, and when that fails, the dispute is \nautomatically referre d to be contested in the High Court. The STB therefore no longer \narbitrates  disputes involving collective sales.  \n18. In any event , we note that the Court of Appeal\u2019s comments , that the \u201cSTB must correctly \napply the appropriate  burden of proo f\u201d, and that \u201cthe absence of a strict burden of proof         \nThe Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 4407    STB No. 45 of 20 21 (Skies Miltonia)  \nv Lin Meiyi Sophie  \n \nPage 12 of 24 \n does not necessarily entail an absence of any legal standard of persuasion \u201d ([102]) are \nin line with regulation 18(1) of the Building Maintenance and Strata Management (Strata \nTitles Boards) Regulation s 2005 which provide that the \u201c Board shall not be bound to \napply the rules of evidence applicable to civil proceedings in any court but may inform \nitself on any matter in such manner as it thinks fit .\u201d  [emphasis added]   \n19. As such, t he Board is not and should not be strictly constrained by the Evidence Act  \n(\u201cEA\u201d) or the usual cases on legal and evidential burden of proof which have been cited \nto us by the Respondent.  \n20. That being said, the Board appreciates that there should nevertheless be som e logical \nbenchmark  or, as the Court of Appeal in Horizon Towers calls it,  some  \u201clegal standard \nof persuasion \u201d that an applicant should meet, in order to persuade or convince a Board \nthat an order should be made in its favour.  Regard may be had therefore to the principles \nregarding the legal and evidential burdens that parties to civil proceedings have to meet . \nThe EA, although not binding on the Board, is nevertheless a good starting point, coupled \nwith the general law on evidence developed over the years. This is especially so where \nthe parties themselves have relied on it in the proceedings before the Board.   \n21. On the facts of this case, the Applicant has alleged that the Respondent has proceeded \nwith various Respondent\u2019s  Works/Structures  without proper authorisation from the \nMCST and/or the relevant regulatory bodies .  The Respondent\u2019s beef with the \nApplicant\u2019s application herein (\u201c Application \u201d) is that it is lacking in particulars and it is \n\u201cimpossible to tell from the Application\u2026how the Works were \u201cunauthorised\u201d as \nalleged \u201d.    \n22. The Board should therefore inform itself on the consideration s as to the relevant burdens \nof proof. The legal burden falls on  the party who asserts the existence of any fact in issue , \nwhile the evidential burden of proof  exists in the form of a tactical onus to contradict, \nweaken or explain away the evidence that has been led  (per the Court of Appeal in \nCooperatieve Centrale Raiffeisen -Boerenleenbank BA, Singapore  Branch v Motorola \nElectronics Pte Ltd  [2011] 2 SLR 63 at [ 30] (\u201c Rabobank\u201d ). Per Britestone Pte Ltd v \nSmith & Associates  Far East Ltd  [2007] 4 SLR(R) 855 at [58] ( \u201cBritestone \u201d), the legal \nburden of proof describes the obligation to persuade the trier of fact that, in view of the \nevidence, the fact in dispute exists. The Court of Appeal added \u201c This obligation never         \nThe Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 4407    STB No. 45 of 20 21 (Skies Miltonia)  \nv Lin Meiyi Sophie  \n \nPage 13 of 24 \n shifts in respect of any fact, and only \u2018shifts\u2019 in a manner of loo se terminology when a \nlegal presumption operates \u201d.  \n23. In this regard, the Board is of the view that the discussion on burden of proof will not be \ncomplete without a reference to the presumption in section 108 EA:  \n\u201cBurden of proving fact especially within knowledge  \n108.  When any fact is especially within the knowledge of any person, the burden of \nproving that fact is upon that person.  \nIllustrations  \n  (b)   A is charged with travelling on a railway without a ticket. The burden of proving \nthat he had a ticket is on him. \u201d \n24. In Burden of Proof and Standard of Proof in Civil Litigation  (2013) 25 SAcLJ 130, the \nlearned author at ([57]  and [58] ) opined that for section  108 to come into play, the party \nwho has the legal burden of proof would have to prove  the inference from its evidence \nthat unless there is rebuttal evidence from the other side, the inference of knowledge as \nasserted by the  plantiff  (Applicant) would prevail, and places the burden on the defendant \n(Respondent) to prove a fact \u201c especia lly within the knowledge \u201d of the  defendant  \n(Respondent).  \n25. On the facts, the Respondent did not set out with sufficient detail the renovations works \nthat she intended to, and did carry out to her Unit in 2018, by way of  the renovation \napplication form that is required under the Development\u2019s Resident Handbook \n(\u201cHandbook \u201d) (AWS Tab 11) . Further, it is not uncommon in cases of alleged \nunauthori sed works that the offending  subsidiary proprietor may have been less than \ncandid in  submitting relevant details to the MCST  with the risk that it be rejected outright. \nIt is also not uncommon that subsidiary proprietors in such situation may also be reluctant \nto and/or make it difficult for the MCST to inspect the subsidiary proprietor\u2019s  premises \nto verify such works. The Board notes that the Applicant has alleged that the Respondent  \nhad \u201c never allowed anyone from the management office or council member to inspect the \nlower terrace \u201d (AWS paragraph 16) , which is where the Respondent\u2019s  Works/Structures \nare. In RCS at 18.5, the Respondent\u2019s counter was that she did not \u201c actively stop or \nprevent the Applicant\u2019s representatives from being apprised of the of the Works in any \nway\u201d, and \u201ceven if this were so, this would be fatal to the Applicant\u2019s case as it         \nThe Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 4407    STB No. 45 of 20 21 (Skies Miltonia)  \nv Lin Meiyi Sophie  \n \nPage 14 of 24 \n demonstrates the Applicant itself is unsure of the basis of its case \u201d. Having essentially \nignored the relevant provisions in the Handbook, and failed to come clean as it were \nabout her intended renovation w orks, it is disingenuous for the Respondent to suggest \nthat she is unable to now know the case she has to meet.   \n26. Insofar as there is a legal burden that the Applicant has to meet, the Applicant has to \nsufficiently show that the fact in dispute , i.e. the issue of the Respondent\u2019s  \nWorks/Structures , exists (per Britestone ). The Board is of the view that this has been met \nby the Applicant on the facts a s to (a) the Respondent\u2019s  Works/Structures, (b) providing \nparticulars  and evidence thereof , to the best of the Respondent\u2019s knowledge  and \ninformation available , and (c) the Respondent not disputing she had works done to the \nroof terrace of her Unit, allegedly for lightning protection , but putting  the onus on the \nApplicant to identify with clarity what the Respondent\u2019s  Works/Structures are. It is not \ndisputed that the onus is upon the individual subsidiary proprietor to seek such approval \nfrom the relevant authority, be it BCA, URA , etc and/or the MCST, for renovation and/or \nalteration works. The onus is thus on the Respondent to prove the Respondent\u2019s  \nWorks/Structures were in fact authorized, but she has proffered no evidence of the same.  \n27. The Board notes that the Respondent also relies on other provisions in the EA as \u201csound \nprinciples of law \u2026 which this Honorable Board may be guided by \u201d (RCS paragraph 6).  \nThe Board agrees and is of the view that the principle in section 108 EA is persuasive  in \nthis case. In cases of this nature, where the fact in dispute is whether one party has \nobtain ed the necessary approvals, the Board is of the view that section  108 EA will place \nthe onus on such party, in this case, the Respondent to then prove that she has in fact \nsought and obtained the necessary approvals from both the MCST and the relevant \nauthorities.  Illustration (b) of s ection  108 EA is instructive ; just as the person charged \nfor travelling without a ticket ha s the burden to prove he or she has a ticket, the \nRespondent here is alleged to have done renovation works without the requisite approval, \nand the burden of proving she had the said approvals  should therefore  fall on her.  \n28. The Board notes that the Respondent remained cagey about whether she has obtained \napprovals from the MCST or the relevant government authorities all throughout these \nproceedings , even during the hearing on 19 April 2022.  Beyond technical arguments, \nthe Re spondent has made no attempt to satisfy the Board that the Applicant is wrong, and \nthat the Respondent\u2019s  Works/Structures were in fact authorized.          \nThe Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 4407    STB No. 45 of 20 21 (Skies Miltonia)  \nv Lin Meiyi Sophie  \n \nPage 15 of 24 \n 29. By way of example, when it was pointed out by the Applicant \u2019s counsel that there was \nan email from BCA dated  25 June 2020 referring to an Order made by BCA with a \ndeadline of 1 August 2020, and that this deadline had already been extended twice (p age \n39 of Form 9), the Respondent was content to merely say that this email was not sent to \nthe Applicant and it is u nclear what the aforesaid Order was referring.  As the email in \nquestion was sent to the Respondent and her father, it is clear that the  Respondent (of all \nparties) should be well -acquainted with the contents thereof  and the Board notes the \nRespondent\u2019s reticent conduct even before the Board .   The Board reiterates that it is not \nfor the Respondent to rely on her own breach to try and stym ie the Application  and the \nBoard finds that the Respondent has failed to discharge her legal and/or evidential burden \nof proof.  \n30. Having considered the factual matrix in this case, the Board notes that while ordinarily \nan applicant is required to state its case with sufficient clarity , in this instance it is not \nreasonable for the Respondent to advance technical arguments of this nature and demand \nthat the Applicant further particularise its case.  In doing so, the Respondent is in essence \nrelying on her own  breach to stymie the Application .   \n31. For avoidance of doubt and be that as it may, the Applicant has clarified the Respondent\u2019s  \nWorks/Structures at the arbitration hearing by marking out the same in the photographs \nfrom Page 12 to Page 19 of its Form 9, corresponding to the description of the said Works \nand page numbers mentioned in its Interlocutory Application (Form 11) (see para graph \n7 above).  \n32. On consideration of parties \u2019 submissions and to the extent necessary, with reference to \nregulation 18(1) of the Building Maintenance and Strata Management (Strata Titles \nBoards) Regulation 2005 , the Board finds that the Applicant has suffic iently discharged \nits legal and evidential burden  in this regard , whereas the Respondent has failed to rebut \nthe same even though the evidence supporting whether the Respondent\u2019s works were in \nfact authorized, if any, was within her own knowledge and possession .   \nWhether the Application is frivolous , vexatious and/or brought in abuse of process, and so \ntherefore should be dismissed.  \n33. For the reasons above, t he Board finds that there is no basis to the Respondent\u2019s \ncontention that the Application is frivolous, vexatious or brought in abuse of process.  If         \nThe Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 4407    STB No. 45 of 20 21 (Skies Miltonia)  \nv Lin Meiyi Sophie  \n \nPage 16 of 24 \n at all, t he Board notes that it might rather be said that it is the Respondent\u2019s continued \nlitigation on matters wh ich have already been decided that is an abuse of process.  \n34. We turn now to deal with each of the substantive issues set out in paragraph 8 above.  \nWhether the alleged Respondent\u2019s  Works/Structures are indeed Unauthorised   \n35. As set out above, in relation to the Respondent\u2019s  Works/Structures, the Board finds that \nthe Respondent has not discharged her burden of showing that she has complied with the \nrelevant by -laws or house rules found in the Handbook prior to constructing the same, or \nthat the Respondent obtained the requisite approvals from the relevant regulatory \nauthorities.     \n36. Ther e is in any event no evidence before the Board that the Respondent\u2019s  \nWorks/Structures have in fact, been authorized either by the MCST or even the regulatory \nauthorities.  As mentioned at paragraph  6(c) above, the URA Grant of Written Permission \ndated 25 January 2017 previously obtained by the Respondent was a conditional one, and \ndoes not assist the Respondent . On the facts, it  is sufficiently clear from the photographs \nthat the Respondent has enclosed the sides of the roof cover and an increase of floor area \nowing to the Respondent\u2019s works  is therefore likely .  \n37. For completeness, we note that while the URA circular no. URA/PB/2014/0 3-DCG \npublished on 28 February 2014 (referred to at AWS Tab 15) has revised the guidelines \nto exempt coverings on private enclosed spaces and private roof terraces from gross floor \narea (\u201c GFA \u201d) computation even for the Development for which plans were approved by \nURA before 12 January 2013, this exemption does not apply if the covered area is \nenclosed at the sides.  URA has also made clear that the owners are still required to meet \nthe requirements of inter alia BCA and FSSD, SCDF a nd comply with the applicable by -\nlaws, and seek consent of the M CST before erect ion.   \n38. The Board accordingly accepts the Applicant\u2019s position as to the Respondent\u2019s  \nWorks/Structures set out at paragraphs [14] to [27] of the ACS .  As this Board has already \ndetermined that there is no evidence that the Respondent\u2019s  Works/Structures have been \nauthorised by the MCST or the relevant authorities, it is not necessary for thi s Board to \nconclusively determine whether the Respondent\u2019s  Works/Structures have infringed any \nspecific statutory regulations/ by -laws. That being said, this Board is of the view that         \nThe Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 4407    STB No. 45 of 20 21 (Skies Miltonia)  \nv Lin Meiyi Sophie  \n \nPage 17 of 24 \n there is at least a prima facie  case that the Respondent has infringed t he following \nprovisio ns / by -laws:  \n(a) Section 33 BMSMA  \u2013 Respondent has failed to obtain approval at general body \nfor the exclusive use of the common property that part of the Respondent\u2019s  \nWorks/Structures rest on.  \n(b) Section 37(1) BMSMA \u2013 Respondent has caused an increase in GFA due to the \nerection of the un authori sed roof shelter with enclosed sides.  \n(c) Section 37(2) BMSMA \u2013 Even if it the unauthorised roof shelter were permissible, \nRespondent has to-date failed to seek and obtain 90% approval for the same at a \ngeneral meeting for the improvement in her Unit.   \n(d) Section 37(3) and 37(4) BMSMA \u2013Respondent has not requested, nor has \nApplicant approved the Respondent\u2019s  Works/Structures which detract from the \nappearance of the Development.     \n(e) With reference to section 63 BMSMA , it is apparent also that in constructing the \nRespondent\u2019s  Works/Structures, the Respondent has interfered with the common \nproperty of the Development.  There is a breach of the Regulation 20, and \nparagraph 5 of the Second Schedule of the Building Mainten ance (Strata \nManagement)  Regulations 2005.  \n39. As an aside, we address in brief the Respondent\u2019s contention that she had removed the \nglass sliding doors at the (see paragraph 6 (k) above) prior to the Application and this \nshould have been taken into account by the Applicant, or the Application amended \naccordingly.  The duty is and has always been on the Respondent to obtain the necessary \napprovals from the MCST before commencing renovation works.  This would of course \nbe in addition to obtaining the requisite regulatory approvals.  In the circumstances, it is \nhardly appropriate for the Respondent to contend that \u201c at no point did the \nRespondent\u2026actively stop or prevent the Applicant\u2019s representatives from being \napprised of the Works in any way.\u201d (see paragraph 25 above) . The MCST cannot be \nexpected to routinely go on a detective hunt or engage in a cat -and-mouse gam e with \nsubsidiary proprietors to see who has failed to comply with the law and to what extent .  \nThis would be a waste of the MCST\u2019s time and resources.          \nThe Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 4407    STB No. 45 of 20 21 (Skies Miltonia)  \nv Lin Meiyi Sophie  \n \nPage 18 of 24 \n 40. The Board is minded therefore to grant an order for the removal of all the Respondent\u2019s  \nWorks/Structures as prayed for in prayer 1 of the Applicant\u2019s Interlocutory Application; \nit is to be noted that this may be more comprehensively framed as an order requiring the \nRespondent to reinstate the entire lower roof terrace and open terrace outside  the \nRespondent\u2019s study/family room of her Unit to its as-built condition, and for the \nRespondent  to reinstate the adjoining common property to its  as-built condition as well .  \nWhether there are other considerations that the Board should take into account and hence allow \nthe Respondent to maintain the same Respondent\u2019s  Works/ Structures   \n41. The Respondent raises two points in this regard. First, that the Application is in the nature \nof a mandatory injuncti on and the Applicant has failed to show why it should be granted \nin this instance.  Second, that there are safety considerations which the Board should take \ninto account in dismissing the Application.  In support, the Respondent has cited the case \nof The M anagement Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 4188 v Lim Yeong Seng and Kam \nLeh Hong Helen [2020] S GSTB 2 (\u201c A Treasure Trove \u201d).  The Board will deal with each \nin turn.   \n42. Applying the test for grant of a mandatory injunction as reiterated most recently in A \nTreasure Trove, the Board finds that the test at [40] has been met,  \n\u201c[t]he general principle to be extracted from these cases is that the court will grant a \nmandatory injunction to redress the breach of a negative covenant, the breach of which \nis already accomplished, unless:  \n(a) The plaintiff\u2019s own conduct would make it unjust to do so; or  \n(b) The breach is trivial or has caused no damage or no appreciable damage to the \nplaintiff and a mandatory injunction would impose substantial damage on the \ndefendant with no counterbalancing benefit to the plaintiff.\u201d  \n43. There is no conduct on the part of the Applicant that would make it unjust to grant the \nprayers sought, nor can i t be said that the breach is trivial and has caused no damage to \nthe Applicant, whereas on counterbalance it would cause damage to the Respondent.   \n44. Simply put, the Respondent is in this situation of her own volition .  At the outset, she had \nelected to buy a penthouse unit with extensive private roof terraces that were clearly \ndemarcated as being \u201c open to sky \u201d.  Akin to the respondents in A Treasure Tr ove, it may         \nThe Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 4407    STB No. 45 of 20 21 (Skies Miltonia)  \nv Lin Meiyi Sophie  \n \nPage 19 of 24 \n well be that the Respondent in this case did not wish to properly describe the intended \nrenovations works at the outset to either the URA or the Applicant as she was aware that \nit would not, and in fact could not be approved \u201c as-is\u201d.  While it would not be  fruitful to \nspeculate further on the Respondent\u2019s motivations for her actions in 2018, it is apparent \nin any event that the Respondent has to-date embarked in a long running cat -and-mouse \ngame with the multiple parties: the Applicant, other su bsidiary proprietors in the \nDevelopment, and even the regulatory authorities  over the Respondent\u2019s  \nStructures/Works.   The Respondent\u2019s consistent stance throughout has been a willful \ndisregard for anyone\u2019s views other than her own.  \n45. On the related issue of  the alleged safety concerns, the Board notes that the Respondent \nfaced an insurmountable barrier in her earlier insistence that only the 2018 Code can and \nshould be applicable to the Development; which was what the Respondent\u2019s professional \nengineers have  suggested should be applied .  However the BCA, STB , the High Court  \nand even the Appellate Division of the High Court  found to the contrary on this issue, \nthat it is the 2010 Code that applies, and that the existing LPS , properly maintained \naccording  to the 2010 Code, is sufficient.   \n46. At risk of repetition, and as referred to at paragraphs 6 (m) and 6 (r) above, both the Board \nin STB 54 of 2020 and the Appellate Division in AD/ OS 48/2021 have made it clear that \nit is the 2010 Code that applies to this Development.   \n47. To deal with this constraint, the Respondent morphed her basis for keeping her alterations; \nshe distinguishes STB 54 of 2020 and the decision of the Appellate Divisi on of the High \nCourt in AD/OS 48/2021 as being limited to deciding that the 2010 Code was applicable \nand not the 2018 Code. In his oral submissions, counsel for the Respondent said that \nwhether the 2010 or 2018 Code applied \u201c doesn\u2019t really matter to us \u201d and does not require \nthis Board \u201c to offend a whole host of learned Members of the Bench and the Bar to make \na finding tha t there is a safety risk \u201d; the Respondent\u2019s position now is that, regardless of \nthe applicable code , a live lightning safety risk still exists for her (Transcript page 119).  \n48. To this end, the Respondent refers to paragraph 38 of the Fifth Schedule of the Bu ilding \nControl Regulations 2003  (\u201cBCR 2003 \u201d): \u201cA lightning protection system shall be \ncapable of protecting the building and its occupants from the effects of lightning strike \u201d. \nThe Respondent cites paragraph 38 to say that \u201c if the correct version of the LPS had been         \nThe Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 4407    STB No. 45 of 20 21 (Skies Miltonia)  \nv Lin Meiyi Sophie  \n \nPage 20 of 24 \n rectified, that would make a difference as regards the safety of the residents at the  \n(Respondent\u2019s) Unit\u201d.  The Respondent also refers to her expert as citing and applying  \nthis said paragraph 38 , which in his view , \u201cconfirmed the deficiencies with the LPS and, \nrelatedly, \u2026.. what needs to be done to live up to the requirements of paragraph 38 \u201d \n(RCS paragraphs 30 and 31).  \n49. The Applicant did not deal with this \u201cchange\u201d in the Respondent\u2019s position. However the \nBoard did not rely solely on the Respondent\u2019s submissions but informed itself on the \napplicability of paragraph 38 of the Fifth Schedule of the BCR 2003 . The Fifth Schedule \nreads as follows:  \n\u201cA. General  \n1. This Schedule sets out the objectives and performance requirements that must \nbe complied with in the design and construction of a building . \n2. The objectives and performance requirements set out herein are deemed to \nhave been satisfied if the design and construction of a building complies with \nthe acceptable solutions set out in the Approved Document. \u201d \n Paragraph 38 , which is found under Clause L of the Fifth Schedule , reads:  \n\u201cL. Lightning Protection  \n Objective  \n37. The objective of paragraph  38 is to protect a building from the direct effects \nof lightning strike and to protect its occupants from the risk of lightning current \nbeing  discharged through the building.  \n Performance requirement  \n38. A lightning protection system shall be capable of protecting the building and \nits occupants from the effects of lightning strike .\u201d \n50. Taken in its proper context, the Fifth Schedule makes it clear that Clause L would be \n\u201cdeemed to have been satisfied if the design and co nstruction of a building complies with \nthe acceptable solutions set out in the Approved Document \u201d. What is then an \u201c Approved \nDocument \u201d? Regulation 2 of the BCR 2003 states that \u201c Approved Document\u201d means an \nApproved Document issued by the Commissioner of Building Control under \nregulation  27. Regulation 27 reads as follows:          \nThe Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 4407    STB No. 45 of 20 21 (Skies Miltonia)  \nv Lin Meiyi Sophie  \n \nPage 21 of 24 \n \u201cAcceptable solutions  \n27 .\u2014 (1)  The Commissioner of Building Control may issue, in such form as he thinks fit, \nand from time to time amend, one or more Approved Documents setting out the \nspecifications, materials, designs or methods of construction (referred to in these \nRegulations as acceptable solutions) which shall, without prejudice to any alternative \nmeans of achieving compliance, be deemed to comply with the  relevant objectives and \nperformance requirements set out in the Fifth  Schedule for the design and construction \nof buildings or endorse, in whole or in part, any document for use in establishing \ncompliance with the requirements of these Regulations.  \n(2)  The plans of any building works that are prepared in accordance with the acceptable \nsolutions and any building works carried out in accordance with the acceptable solutions \nshall be deemed to comply with the relevant objectives and performance requirements \nset out in the Fifth  Schedule .\u201d \n51. As it turns out, the Approved Document refers to SS 555:2010 \u2013 Code of Practice for \nProtection Against Lightning; i.e. the same 2010 Code in these proceedings. The relevant \nparagraphs  in the BCA Circular dated 31 December 2010  state as follows:  \n\u201c2  Clause L on Lightning Protection in the Fifth Schedule of the Building Control \n  Regulations (on Objectives and Performance Requirements for the  Design and \n  Construction of Buildings) requi res buildings and its occupants  to be protected \n  from the direct effects of lightning strike and the risk of  lightning current being \n  discharged through the building . Currently,  designs which are in accordance with \n  Singapore Standard CP 33 \u2013 Code of  Practice for Lightning Protection are deemed \n  to have complied with the above  Objectives and Performance Requirements.  \n 3  With the launch of the new SS 555:2010 \u2013 Code of Practice for  Protection against \n  Lightning in November 2010, BCA has decided to adopt it  to replace CP 33 as the \n  deemed approved solution for compliance with the  Regulations.  With effect from \n  1 July 2011, developments whose building  plans are submitted on or after this date \n  must comply with the relevant  requirements in SS 555:20 10.\u201d \nThe 2010 Code is therefore the \u201c deemed approved solution \u201d for compliance with Clause \nL of the Fifth Schedule.  A copy of the BCA Circular dated 31 December 2010 is \nappended to this ground s of decision.          \nThe Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 4407    STB No. 45 of 20 21 (Skies Miltonia)  \nv Lin Meiyi Sophie  \n \nPage 22 of 24 \n 52. It is therefore apparent that citing paragraph 38 of Clause L of the Fifth Schedule does \nnot assist the Respondent, who, as it turns out, has made a circular argument leading right  \nback to the applicable Code , and for which she has already conceded that  the 2010 Code  \napplies . \n53. The Board further notes BCA\u2019s comments  via email dated 13 December 2021 (AWS Tab \n13) on the more recent alleged lighting incidents at the Development on 18 November \n2021, \u201c there is no LPS that can fully prevent lighting from striking a building \u201d and \u201cwith \na residual damage risk from lightning strikes of 5% \u201d [emphasis added].  BCA has also \nreminded that the onus is on the residents to go indoors during bad weather, and not to \nexpect the LPS to act as an invincible shield against all lightning  strikes.  In the same \nemail, BCA had added that \u201c[w]e also wish to reiterate that, for residen t\u2019s personal safety, \nresidents should stay indoors during inclement weather to avoid being struck by lightning.  \nPlease remind residents to stay indoors during inclement weather.\u201d BCA has left it to \nthe MCST to consider if further enhancements are to be ca rried out to the LPS and to \nengage appropriate professional engineers to do so if this is the case. This does not mean \nthe LPS in the Development are unsafe and/or non -compliant with the relevant lightning \nprotection code , which in this case is the 2010 Co de. \n54. The Board is of the view therefore that the Respondent\u2019s concerns as to safety are \nunfounded . The Board does not agree that the Respondent\u2019s  Works/Structures or even \nthe roof shelter in itself are safety equipment as defined in section 37A of the BMSMA  \nwhich are necessitated as a result of alleged deficiencies with the applicable lightning \nprotection code .  Certainly in the face of the consistent findings of the BCA, STB and \nthe Appellate Division  of the High Court , it would not be possible for this Board to find \notherwise.   \n55. Finally, with reference to the photograph of the Respondent\u2019s lower roof terrace taken \non 7 March 2022, the Board notes that the Respondent has placed two potted plants on \ntop of the erected roof cover  (See ACS Tab D) .   If, the Respondent is truly concerned \nabout the possibility of lightning strikes and wishes to maximise the safety of her Unit, \nit beggars belief  why the Respondent would seek to increase the height of the structures \non her Unit ;  the placement of such  plants increases that further and increases the risk of \nlightning  strikes.          \nThe Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 4407    STB No. 45 of 20 21 (Skies Miltonia)  \nv Lin Meiyi Sophie  \n \nPage 23 of 24 \n Summary of Board\u2019s Findings  \n56. In conclusion therefore, the Board notes that the Respondent has shown consistent and \nblatant disregard for the authority of the Applicant, in disregarding almost all procedures \nput in place to regulate the strata living of the Development.  In addition,  it is concerning \nthat the Respondent has displayed little to no regard for the regulatory authorities, Strata \nTitles Board\u2019s previous determinations on this issue , or even the Appellate Division\u2019s \njudgment on the issue of what is the applicable LPS Code, and what is considered safe \nfor the Development. As BCA has pointed out, if the Respondent is really concerned with \nlightning strikes on her roof terrace, she and her family and friends should stay indoors \nduring inclement weather to avoid being struck by lightning. On the facts of this case and \nhaving rega rd to the past proceedings, the Board is not convinced that the renovation \nand/or alteration works undertaken by the Respondent was meant solely or even \nsubstantially for this purpose.  \n57. The Board therefore allows the Application in its entirety  and orders  as follows:  \n(1) that the Respondent dismantle all the Respondent\u2019s  Works/Structures as identified \nin Prayer 1(i ) to (v) of the Applicant\u2019s Interlocutory Application dated 7 January \n2022 and reinstate the entire lower roof terrace and open terrace  outside the \nRespondent\u2019s study/family room  of her Unit to its as-built condition, and \nconsequently to reinstate the adjo ining common property to its as-built condition \nas well , within two ( 2) months from the date of this Order .    \n(2) The Respondent to pay for the engagement of a professional engineer to be \nappointed by the Applicant to confirm that the reinstatement works have  been \ncarried out as ordered by this Board  and to allow access to the Respondent\u2019s \npremises for this purpose .  The professional engineer\u2019s findings shall be deemed \nconclusive.  \n58. On the issue of costs, costs should follow the event and the Board accepts the Applicant\u2019s \nsubmissions  that costs on an indemnity basis is applicable .  Both the Renovation Form \nsigned by the Respondent, and the by -laws and Handbook provide for the subsidiary \nproprietor to bear t he MCST\u2019s costs on an indemnity basis if the subsidiary proprietor \nacts in breach of the law and by -laws.

Beauty World Centre is a 25 -level commercial cum residential development constructed in \n1984 by the Urban Redevelopment Authority. The complex was transferred to Pidemco Land \nLtd (\u201cPidemco \u201d) in 1989 and after MCST Plan No . 2121 was constituted on 8 October 1997, \nit took over the control, management and administration of the complex. It is the applicant in \nthis case.  \n2. According to the applicant, there are 16 lots on the 4th level. There is one Strata Certificate of \nTitle for Lot MK 16 -U2096L which is one of the lots on the 4th level and there are 41 food \nstalls on the lot which are numbered as #04 -18 to #04 -28 and #04 -38 to #04 -67. The registered \nsubsidiary proprietors of the lot, which covers an area of 1255sqm and has 737 sh are values \nout of a total of 10000 are Tan Kok Meng and Lai Chong Lee. They are the trustees of Beauty \nWorld Centre Merchants Association and respondents in this case . \n3. During mediation , the applicant submitted sectional drawings prepared by M /s Lander Loke  \nArchitects showing various levels of the building and locations of the horizontal and vertical    \n   \n \nThe Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 2121   STB No. 108 of 20 21 (Beauty World Centre)   \nv Lai Chong Lee and Tan Kock  Meng       \n  \nPage 3 of 6 waste discharge pipes. It could be seen from the drawings that water and other waste flowed \nout of level 4 by way of floor trap s into horizontal discharge pipes  under the floor. The \nhorizontal discharge pipes then connected to vertical waste stack pipe s that drained the water \nand other waste to a grease trap at the ground level in front of unit #01 -46. \n4. In this case the horizontal discharge pipes at the 4th level flowed into 3 vertical waste stacks. \nHowever , only one was connected to the grease trap at the ground level because at level 2 of \nthe building the other 2 vertical waste stacks joined and connected with the vertical waste \nstack pipe that ended at the grease trap.  \n5. In addition to receiving water and waste from level 4 , the grease trap at the ground level \nreceived water and waste from horizontal discharge pipes at the ground level.  \nBACKGROUND  \n6. This is an application in relation to works carried out by the applicant on a choke in the vertical \nwaste s tack pipe (\u201c VWSP \u201d) that affected a unit on the 3rd level viz #03 -34 (a foul sewerage \nodour). According to the applicant, the management agent was on 23 June 2020 informed by \na representative of #03 -34 that the VWSP that passed through the unit had begun to  leak. The \napplicant was of the view that the respondents were responsible for the necessary repair works \nbut when the respondents denied responsibility, the applicant engaged M/s AA Plumbing \nEngineering Pte Ltd to do the necessary on 26 June 2020. From th e particulars in the invoices \nat pages 105 and 106 in Form 9 of the Application, a hydraulic machine was used to clear the \nchoke at level 4 at a cost of $1800 and a 150m section of the pipe at level 2 was cut and \nreplaced at a cost of $1500. The total cost  for repairs was $3,300.  \n7. The applicant has applied for various orders in relation to the maintenance of the VWSP and \ngrease trap and for costs incurred when the VWSP was repaired. It is the case for the applicant \nthat the VWSP and grease trap belong to the  respondents because they served the respondents \nexclusively and are not common property. On the part of the respondents, they oppose to the \napplication because it is their case that the VWSP and grease trap are common property.  \n8. It was a common ground that  a finding by the Board as to whether or not the VWSP and grease \ntrap were common property would determine the outcome of the application.  \n9. Common property is defined in section 2 of the Building Maintenance and Strata Management \nAct Cap 30C and in respect of parts of land and the building, it must not be comprised in any \nlot and must be used or capable of being used or enjoyed by the occupiers of 2 or more lots. \nThere was no dispute that the VWSP and grease trap were not comprised in the respondents\u2019 \nlot. T he dispute was as to whether it was used or capable of being used by the occupiers of 2 \nor more lots.  \n10. There was no dispute that when the application was filed the VWSP was draining water and \nwaste from not only the respondents\u2019 lot but also from a horizon tal discharge pipe from a lot \nat #02 -33. It was also not in dispute that the grease trap was servicing water and waste not \nonly from the respondents\u2019 lot but also water and waste from a discharge pipe from lot at #01 -\n39/40 which had been constructed at som e point of time when the building was owned by \nPidemco. Also not in dispute was the fact that in the common area of level 4 outside of the    \n   \n \nThe Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 2121   STB No. 108 of 20 21 (Beauty World Centre)   \nv Lai Chong Lee and Tan Kock  Meng       \n  \nPage 4 of 6 respondents\u2019 lot, there was a floor trap with a horizontal discharge under it that was connected \nto the VWSP. At the point of time when repairs were being carried out on the VWSP, this floor \ntrap was covered up. According to the applicant (paragraph 27 of AW1), a Mr Siva, who was \na technician working for the managing agent, had been instructed to seal the floor trap with  \nsilicone sealant sometime between 2015 to 2016. On 28 August 2020, it was discovered that \nsomeone had removed the seal without authorisation and steps were taken to reseal the trap \non 31 August 2020.   \n11. Accordingly, when the application was filed, the fact s from the physical evidence was that the \nVWSP and grease trap were being used and capable of being used by the occupiers of 2 or \nmore lots.  \nTHE APPLICANT\u2019S  SUBMISSION  \n12. The submission of the applicant that the VWSP  was not common property was based on the \nevidence in the original building drawings, which did not show the VWSP servicing drainage \nof water and waste from sources other than the respondents\u2019 lot. The applicant submitted that \nthe VWSP was constructed sole ly for the use of the respondents\u2019 lot.   \n13. The applicant could not deny that it was a fact that there was a water trap in the common area \nof level 4 that allowed for water and waste to be drained from that area via the VWSP to the \ngrease trap i.e. the VWSP w as not servicing the discharge of water and waste solely from the \nrespondents\u2019 lot. It was the contention of the applicant that discharge from this area had not \nbeen provided for when the building was constructed i.e. the developer did not intend for the \nVWSP to be used by the owners of lots other than the respondents\u2019.  \n14. The applicant could also not deny that there was a horizontal pipe that provided for the \ndischarge of water and waste from unit #02 -33 via the VWSP to the grease trap. In this case, \nit was the applicant\u2019s submission that this connection from #02 -33 was a p rivate arrangement \nbetween the subsidiary proprietor of the unit and the respondents. The applicant exhibited a \nletter (Tab J of AW1) dated 15 March 2015 from the owner of #02 -33 to the respondents to \ninform that there was a need on his part to connect a d ischarge pipe from his unit to the VWSP. \nThe letter inter alia informed that the applicant had been informed of the connection and terms \nof an agreement between the owner of #02 -33 and the respondents.  \n15. In relation to the connection of the discharge pipe fr om #01 -39/40 to the grease trap, this \nconnection was made before the applicant was constituted and was constructed by Pidemco \nwho was the owner of the complex at that point of time. It was the submission of the applicant \nthat there was, at the time when th e connection was constructed, a private arrangement \nbetween the owner of #01 -39/40 and the respondents for the maintenance of the grease trap.  \nTHE RESPONDENTS\u2019 SUBMISSION  \n16. The respondents referred to the fact that the VWSP and grease trap were  in fact used by the \noccupiers of 2 or more lots. Whilst the respondent, Lai Chong Lee, did not dispute that he \nsigned the letter dated 15 March 2015 (Lai Chong Lee had initially disputed having any \nagreement with the subsidiary proprietor of #02 -33 but admitted that he  did sign the letter \ndated 15 March 2015), it was submitted that the fact of the connection proved that the VWSP    \n   \n \nThe Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 2121   STB No. 108 of 20 21 (Beauty World Centre)   \nv Lai Chong Lee and Tan Kock  Meng       \n  \nPage 5 of 6 was capable of being used by occupiers of 2 or more lots. They also denied that there was an \nagreement with the owner of #01 -39/40 for them to maintain the grease trap and denied having \nany knowledge of the construction of the floor trap at level 4 that was outside the boundary of \ntheir lot. It was the case for the respondents that from the materials used and the location of \nthe floor trap, it wa s constructed when the building was constructed.  \nDECISION OF THE BOARD  \n17. Before dealing with the submissions, it will be in order to note that there was no evidence that \ni) the construction of the discharge pipe from #01 -39/40 to the grease trap, ii) the construction \nand connection of the horizontal pipe from #02 -33 to the VWSP , and iii) the construction of \nthe floor trap in the common area at level 4   was illegal or not in accordance with the \nrequirements of any regulatory body.  \n18. There was no evidence as to when exactly the discharge pipe from #01 -39/40 was constructed \nbut there  is no dispute that this took place before the applicant was constituted. After the pipe \nwas constructed, the grease trap was servicing water and waste from #01 -39/40.  \n19. From the contents of the letter (Tab J of AW1), the applicant was, in March 2015, inform ed of \nthe connection of the discharge pipe from #02 -33 to the VWSP and the VWSP was, after the \nconnection, used to drain water and waste from that lot to the grease trap.  \n20. Before the floor trap in the common area at level 4 was sealed on the instruction of the \nmanaging agent at some point of time between 2015 and 2016, water and waste were being \ndrained from the common area at level 4 to the grease trap at ground level via the VWSP. The \napplicant had, inter alia, applied for an order for the respondents to r emove the floor trap and \nreinstate the affected common area. Other than the fact that the trap was not in the original \nbuilding drawings, there was no evidence as to when, how and why the trap and pipe beneath \nwere constructed. There was absolutely no evid ence that the respondents had anything to do \nwith the construction and installation and no evidence to find that it was installed and \nconstructed at some point of time after the applicant was constituted on 8 October 1997. It \nwas clearly not possible for t he Board to make the order sought.  \n21. The reliance of the applicant on the original building drawings in support of its submission \nthat the VWSP and grease trap were not \u201ccommon property\u201d because it was the intention of \nthe owner at that time that they were i ntended solely for the use of the food court, was not \nhelpful. It is not the definition of \u201ccommon property\u201d that it must be a part of a building that \nwas, at the time of construction, intended to be used by 2 or more occupiers and that if it was \nat the ti me of construction used by the occupier of only one lot, it cannot be common property.  \n22. There was no evidence that when the complex was constructed, the owner of the land intended \nthat it was to be a \u201csubdivided building\u201d and it will be in order to assume that at that point of \ntime a schedule of strata units was not filed and accepted by the Commissioner of Buildings \nand a strata title plan was not registered by the Registrar of Titles. A finding as to whether or \nnot a part of a building is common property can only be made after the strata title plan had \nbeen registered .    \n   \n \nThe Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 2121   STB No. 108 of 20 21 (Beauty World Centre)   \nv Lai Chong Lee and Tan Kock  Meng       \n  \nPage 6 of 6 Once the strata title plan is registered, the Registrar will issue a subsidiary strata certificate \nof title for each lot shown on the strata title plan. Each such title is registered in the subsidiary \nstrata land register which is prepared and maintained by the Registrar. Furth er, on \nregistration of the strata title plan, the Registrar shall enter a memorial in the land register \non the volume and folio of the parcel to the effect that a subsidiary strata land register has \nbeen created. This leads to the fourth effect of registra tion of the strata title plan which is that \nthereupon the common property will be held by the subsidiary proprietors as tenants -in-\ncommon proportional to their respective share values and for the same term and tenure as \ntheir respective lots are held by th em (s  13(1)). The common property thus is vested in the \nsubsidiary proprietors and not in the management corporation. Once the subsidiary strata \ntitle certificate of title for each lot has been issued, a purchaser of a lot can be registered as \nthe subsidia ry proprietor of that lot and his share of the common property. - Choo Kok Lin \nand Another v The Management Corp Strata Title Plan No 2405 [2005] SGHC 144 at 26.  \n23. Even if it was the intention of the owner when the complex was being constructed that the \nVWSP and grease trap were to be used solely by the respondents, they could not be other than \n\u201ccommon property\u201d if they were such when the applicant was constituted on  8 October 1997.  \n24. The VWSP and grease trap are in this case not comprised in the respondents\u2019 lot and will be \n\u201ccommon property\u201d if they are \u201cused or capable of being used by the occupiers of 2 or more \nlots\u201d. They were in fact being used by the occupiers of 2 or more lots and this would confirm \nthat they are capable of being used by the occupiers of 2 or more lots. It is the finding of the \nBoard that the VWSP and grease traps are common property.  \n25. The applications for the orders applied for are dismissed . \nDate d this  13th day of May 2022  \n  _______________________  \nMr Remedios F.G  \nDeputy President  \n_______________________  \nMr Lai Huen Poh  \nMember  \n_______________________  \nMs Elaine Chew  \nMember  \n   Mr Kyle Leslie Sim (Wee, Tay & Lim LLP ) for the  Applicant . \nMr G.

The Applicant  is the Subsidiary Proprietor  (\u201cSP\u201d) of the unit at 28 Bukit Batok East \nAvenue 2 #XXX , Singapore 659921  (\u201cthe Applicant\u201d ). The Respondent is  the \nmanagement corporation of the development known as Hillview Regency  (\u201cthe \nRespondent \u201d).  \n \n2. Due to the incidents  of objects  falling into the Applicant\u2019s PES , the Applicant at the 14th \nAnnual General Meeting (\u201cAGM \u201d) on 19 September 2020  moved a private motion  for \nthe installation of a cover / shelter  at his PES  by way of special resolution  but failed to Nishad Ahmad Narod v   STB No. 80 of 20 21 (Hillview Regency)  \nThe MCST Plan No. 3044    \n \n3 \n obtain at least 75% of t he total share value of the votes for the special resolution  to be \npassed as a by -law.1 \n \n3. The Applicant had on 1 December 2020 submitted a Renovation Works Application Form \n(\u201cRWAF \u201d) for the installation of the retractable awning, described in the RWAF as \nfollows:  \n \n\u201cTo install structure on balcony to prevent harm to our child Propose to install \nretractable awning below the metal trellis , anchored to the fa\u00e7ade wall using wall \nbrack ets.  Awning to extend along the length of the balcony not exceeding 2m from \nbuilding line with the awning to remain within the boundary of the PES when fully \nextended .\u201d 2 \n \n4. This application was filed on 9 July 2021 after the Applicant failed to obtain the  \nRespondent\u2019s approval for the installation of a retractable awning  at the Private Enclosed \nSpace (\u201c PES\u201d) of his unit.  The Applicant  sought the following order(s)  from the Board : \n \n\u201c(i) that the Respondent consents to the Applicant's installation of a retractable \nawning at his private enclosed space; and  \n \n(ii) that the Respondent pays the Applicant costs for this application. \u201d \n \nThe Applicant \u2019s Case \n \n5. The Applicant\u2019s case was that since September 2020, the Applicant had informed  or \nreported to  the Respondent about  incidents of objects  falling into his PES and he referred \nto these as \u201ckiller litter\u201d incidents  (i.e. the \u201cFirst Rope Incident\u201d, the \u201cFlower Pot Incident\u201d \nand \u201cS econd Rope Incident \u201d).3  As a result, the Applicant  is of the view that he is entitled \nto install the awning as an exception under paragraph 5(3) of the prescribed by laws in the \nSecond Schedule of the Building Maintenance (Strata Management) Regulations 2005  \n(\u201cBMSMR 2005 \u201d).4  Under the said paragraph, h e argues that the cover / shelter is \nnecessary to ensure the safety of his daughter in relation to the  issue of \u201ckiller litter \u201d at \nhis PES.  \n \n6. After  the Applicant failed to obtain the resolution for the installation of a cover / s helter , \nhe requested the Respondent to provide guidelines for installing a safety cover over his \n \n1 Affidavit of Evidence -in-Chief (\u201cAEIC\u201d) of Ahmad Ibrahim Bin Mohd Tahir dated 6 December 2021 at 24 \nand AEIC of Nishad Ahmad Narod dated 2 December 2021 at paragraphs [14] & [15].  \n2 Applicant\u2019s application dated 30 June 2021 at page 10 and at Annex L, infra n 3, 67-73.  \n3 AEIC of Nishad Ahmad Narod dated 2 December 2021 at paragraph [10].  \n4 Id, at paragraph [7].  Nishad Ahmad Narod v   STB No. 80 of 20 21 (Hillview Regency)  \nThe MCST Plan No. 3044    \n \n4 \n PES.5 The Applicant also called the police with respect to the incident of the flower pot \nfalling into his PES  6 and his  wife made police report s with respect to incident s of  ropes \nfalling into the Applicant\u2019s unit\u2019s PES  7, enquired  of the Building and Construction \nAuthority  on the installation of a covering at the Applicant\u2019s PES  8, enquired o f the Urban \nRedevelopment A uthority  on the addition of a retractable awning  9; and also sought \nassistance from  a Member of Parliament  on the same. 10   \n \nThe Respondent\u2019s Case  \n \n7. The Respondent \u2019s case was  that the Applicant is required to meet the statutory \nrequirements under section 33 of the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act \n(\u201cBMSMA \u201d) at the General Meeting,11 and the Respondent had installed CCTV to curb \nthe instances of high -rise littering.12  The Respondent denies that there was \u201ckiller litter\u201d \nand submits that there is no evidence to substantiate the Applicant\u2019s allegations of \u201ckil ler \nlitter\u201d .  The Res pondent submitted  there is only \u201chigh rise littering\u201d and the Applicant \nchose to use the terms \u201ckiller litter\u201d to justify his request for the installation of the cover / \nshelter as a safety device under paragraph 5(3) of the BMSMR 2005.13  The Respondent\u2019s \nunderstanding of the term \u201ckiller litter\u201d is that it is limited to intentional or \u201cconscious\u201d \nwrongful acts; i.e. someone knowingly throwing something dangerous down a high -rise. \n14  This accounted for their response that the police had not been able to identify anyone \nguilty of such  acts and also for their insistence that the installation of CCTV to catch the \nculprit would be the appropriate response.  \n \nIssues and Board\u2019s Findings  \n \n8. The Board noted in the Applicant\u2019s Affidavit of evidence -in-chief  (\u201cAEIC \u201d) that (a) the \nsecond incident of the rope falling into the Applicant\u2019s PES which occurred on 29 \nSeptember  2021 ,15 (b) the Extra-Ordinary General Meeting (\u201c EOGM \u201d) which was held \non 13 November 202116, and (c) the Respondent\u2019s proposal on 7 December 2021 for an \ninvisible tightly knitted  wire netting above the Applicant\u2019s PES  17 had all occurred  after \n \n5 Id, at paragraphs [16] and [19].  \n6 Id, at pargraphs [28] and [29].  \n7 Id, at paragraphs [17] and [39].  \n8 Id, at paragraph [18].  \n9 Id, at paragraph [22].  \n10 Id, at paragraph [27].  \n11 Respondent\u2019s Written Submissions at  2-3, 5-9, 12 -13 and 18 -19. \n12 AEIC of Ahmad Ibrahim Bin Mohd  Tahir dated 6 December 2021 at 78, 101 & 122.  \n13 Supra n 11  at 12.  \n14 Transcript hearing on 29 December 2021 at page 164 Lines 3 -22 and page 166 at Lines 12 -17. \n15 Supra n 3 at paragraphs [38] and [39].  \n16 Supra n 3 at paragraph [40].  \n17 Supra n 3 at paragraph [43] and 214 -215.  Nishad Ahmad Narod v   STB No. 80 of 20 21 (Hillview Regency)  \nThe MCST Plan No. 3044    \n \n5 \n this application was filed.  The Respondent chose not to cross -examine the Applicant or \nto object to the evidence  at the hearing . The duty of the Board is to examine all the relevant \nevidence put forward by the parties which is material and relevant to the dispute between \nthe parties.    \n \n9. In response to the RWAF  referred to in paragraph [3] above , the Respondent\u2019s suggestion \nwas for the installation of CCTV to resolve the issue of objects  falling into the Applicant \u2019s \nunit\u2019s PES. 18  Further, the  Board noted in the Respondent\u2019s letter dated on or about 13 \nJanuary 2021  / 14 January 2021  the following : \n \n\u201cThus, for your application on 1 December 2020 , Council [sic] opines that it will \nbe acting ultra vires and beyond its powers, authority to grant consent and allow \nyour application for awnings on this matter, as to do so, would mean that Council \nupturns the decision at the last general meeting on 19 September 2020 that had \nalready disapproved of similar matters (coverings / awnings) raised by you in your \nprivate motion .\u201d  19 \n \n10. The Board also noted that on 24 May 2021, the Applicant\u2019s counsel wrote to the \nRespondent about the incident of the  flower pot  falling int o the Applicant\u2019s PES on 21 \nMay 2021  i.e. the Flower Pot Incident  and requested for a copy of the guidelines on the \ninstallation of retractable a wnings.20 In their letter dated 17 June 2021, the Respondent \nreplied to the Applicant\u2019s counsel for the Applicant to wait for the outcome of the police \ninvestigation on the flower pot incident and that:  \n \n\u201c\u2026as investigations are ongoing\u2026we herein propose your client together with \nManagement  await the conclusion of the ongoing police investigation on this matter \nand latter\u2019s findings thereto and thereafter for Management Council to review your \nclient\u2019s request  to have guidelines on installation of retractable awnings vis a vis \nthe findings from the concluded police investigation \u2026\u201d21 \n \n11. The Board will address the following issues with respect to this application:  \n \n(a) Whether the Applicant had discharged his burden of  proof in showing that there was \nkiller litter / high rise littering for which an installation of retractable awning (\u201cthe \nrenovation works \u201d) would be allowed under paragraph 5(3) of the Second \nSchedule of the BMSMR 2005 ; and  \n \n18 Supra n 3 at paragraph [23].  \n19 Supra n 12  at 80, 103, and 124.  \n20 Supra n 3 at 100 -104.  \n21 Supra n 12 at 89.  Nishad Ahmad Narod v   STB No. 80 of 20 21 (Hillview Regency)  \nThe MCST Plan No. 3044    \n \n6 \n  \n(b) Whether the Respondent had unreasonably refused to consent to the Applicant\u2019s \nproposal on 1 December 2020 with respect to the installation of the retractable \nawning at the Applicant\u2019s PES pursuant to section 111  of the  BMSMA . \n \nWhether the Applicant had discharged his burden of proof in showing that there was killer \nlitter / high rise littering for which an installation of retractable awning would be allowed \nunder paragraph 5(3) of the Second Schedule BMSMR 2005  \n \n12. Paragraph 5(3) of Second Schedule  of the BMSMR 2005 states as follows:  \n \n\u201cAlteration or damage to common property  \n \n5-(1) A subsidiary proprietor or an occupier of a lot shall not mark, paint, drive \nnails or screws or the like into, or otherwise damage or deface, any structure that \nforms part of the common property except with the prior written approval of t he \nmanagement corporation.  \n \n(2) An approval given by the management corporation under paragraph (1) shall \nnot authorise any additions to the common property.  \n \n(3) T his by -law shall not prevent a subsidiary proprietor or an occupier of a lot or \na person authorised by such subsidiary proprietor or occupier from installing \u2013 \n \n(a) any locking or other safety device for protection of the subsidiary proprietor\u2019s \nor occupier\u2019s lot against intruders or to improve safety within that lot;  \n \n(b) any screen or other device to prevent entry of animals or insects on the lot;  \n \n(c) any structure or device to prevent harm to children; or \n \n(d) any device used to affix decorative items to the internal surfaces of the walls in \nthe subsidiary proprietor\u2019s or occupier\u2019s lot.  \n \n(4) Any such locking or safety device , screen, other device or structure must be \ninstalled in a competent and proper manner and must have an appearance, after \nit has been in stalled, in keeping with such guidelines as the management \ncorporation may prescribe regarding such installations, and with the \nappearance of the rest of the building.  \n \n(5) The subsidiary proprietor and occupier of a lot shall \u2013 Nishad Ahmad Narod v   STB No. 80 of 20 21 (Hillview Regency)  \nThe MCST Plan No. 3044    \n \n7 \n  \n(a) maintain and keep in a  state of good and serviceable repair any installation \nor structure referred to in paragraph (3) notwithstanding that it forms part of the \ncommon property and services the lot; and  \n \n(b) repair any damage caused to any part of the common property by the \ninstallation or removal of any locking or safety device, screen, other device or \nstructure referred to in paragraph (3) notwithstanding that it forms part of the \ncommon property and services the lot. \u201d \n \n13. In Pang Loon Ong and others v The MCST Plan No. 4288  [2019] SGSTB 6  (\u201cD\u2019Leedon \u201d) \nat paragraph [2], the applicants in that case had used  the term \u201ckiller\u201d litter in that context  \nto refer to \u201c objects thrown or falling from high buildings which endangered the people \nbelow \u201d. The Board wishes to point out that the  BMSMA and Regulations thereunder do \nnot prescribe that the prevention of harm to children is limited to any number of defined \nrisks. That must surely be correct as the sole aim of paragraph 5(3)(c) of the 2nd Schedule \nof BMSMR 2005  is the prevention of harm to children, and the risk of harm from above \nin the context of high -rise living in Singapore is that of dangerous objects falling from \nabove, however that may arise. This will usually depend on the facts of each case. \nAlthough th e term \u201ckiller\u2019 litter has been used in a number of cases before the Board, and \nin those cases, there may well have been objects thrown from above, this should not be \nread as limiting or circumscribing the extent of the protection conferred  by paragraph \n5(3)(c) of the 2nd Schedule of BMSMR 2005 in any way. A good example on the facts of \nthis case would be the multiple cases of shattered glass falling from high as a result of \nopen windows being slammed shut with great force due to strong winds. (See paragrap hs \n[18] and [19] below ). As such, the use of the term \u201ckiller litter\u201d must be read in its proper \ncontext for applications under paragraph 5(3)(c) of the 2nd Schedule of BMSMR 2005 as \ndangerous objects falling from above.   \n \n14. In Sit Kwong Lam v Management Co rporation Strata Title Plan No. 26 45 [2018] 1 SLR \n790, the Court of Appeal held that timber decking ostensibly installed on common \nproperty without the approval of the management corporation  for the protection of \nchildren would be in breach of the relevant by -laws unless the structure fell within the \nexceptio n in by -law 5(3)(c).  The SP there contended that the exception was meant to \ninclude any structure that protected any children in any place in the development.  The \nCourt of Appeal clarified that the exception applied only where the structure was to \npreven t harm to children within the SP\u2019s lot.  The Court of Appeal did not contemplate \nthat this exception is subject to the necessary votes being obtained at an AGM (per \nD\u2019Leedon at paragraph [15]). At paragraph [72], Chief Justice Su ndaresh Menon had \ninterpret ed paragraph 5(3)(c) of the Second Schedule of the BMSMR 2005 as follows:  Nishad Ahmad Narod v   STB No. 80 of 20 21 (Hillview Regency)  \nThe MCST Plan No. 3044    \n \n8 \n  \n\u201c\u2026Reading the exception in by -law 5(3)(c) in a consistent way, we were of the view \nthat it must similarly be limited to the situation where a subsidiary proprietor \nerected a structure or device on common property in order to prevent harm to \nchildren when they were within his lot. \u201d \n \n15. The Board noted the series of cases cited in paragraph [24] of the High Court\u2019s ruling in \nMu Qi and anor v Management Corporation Strata Plan No. 1849  [2021] SGHC 180 \n(\u201cMu Qi \u201d) where awnings are deemed to be \u201csafety devices\u201d under paragraph 5(3) of the \nBMSMR 2005  (e.g. Rosalina Soh Pei Xi v Hui Mun Wai and the Management \nCorporation Strata Plan No. 4396 [2019] SGSTB 5 (\u201c Rosalina Soh Peh Xi \u201d), D\u2019Leedon , \nAhmad bin Ibrahim and Others v The MCST Plan No. 4131  [2019] SGSTB 8) . The Board \nin Rosalina Soh Pei Xi  at paragraph [27] had stated the position in relation to the law on \nthe installation of awnings in a strata development as follows:  \n \n\u201c(a) Ordinarily, a 90% resolution is required to enact a by -law in relation to the \ninstallation of an awning which is affixed to common prope rty.  If the requisite \nresolution is obtained, then the subsidiary proprietor is entitled to install the awning \nas per the terms of the resolution;  \n(b) However, if there is \u201ckiller\u201d litter problem, then the management corporation \nis empowered, indeed oblig ated, to stipulate for guidelines in respect of the \ninstallation of awnings pursuant to paragraph 5(3) of the BMSMR 2005; and  \n \n(c) In light of an insistence by the management corporation on the installation of \nretractable awnings, the Board has held that the management corporation\u2019s \nposition is justified because it was a necessary, reasonable and proportionate \nresponse to the \u201ckiller\u201d litter problem .\u201d \n \n16. The Board noted that  that parties did not dispute that the fa\u00e7ade wall was common \nproperty and that a 90% resolution had not been obtained for the installation of an awning \naffixed to common property in this case  i.e. at the 3 November 2021 EOGM .  The Board \nnoted that there was a \u201cPRIVATE MOTION BY UNIT  #XXX , TOWER 1B, MR \nNISHAD AHMAD NAROD. COVER/ SH ELTER INSTALLATION ON BALCONY \nAREA \u2013 SPECIAL RESOLUTION\u201d  22  as stated in paragraph [2] above, and while details \nwere lacking  as to the type of cover / shelter installation proposed by the Applicant  at that \nforum , for the exclusive use of common property f or more than 3 years, a 90% resolution \nwould ordinarily have been required  under section 33 of the BMSMA .

During  the trial, evidence was heard on an incident  of flower  pot and two (2) incidents of \nropes falling into the Applicant\u2019s PES.  The flower pot incident had happened when there \nwas heavy rain 23 and the rope incident (s) had happened when notice  had earlier been  \ngiven to the Applicant for the building\u2019s  fa\u00e7ade works which required the ropes  to be \nused. The Board is of the view  that these three (3) incidents of (heavy ) objects falling into \nthe Applicant\u2019s unit\u2019s PES would have caused serious harm to the Applicant\u2019s child if she \nhad unfortunately been at the PES area at the m aterial time . \n \n(b)  Shattered Glass Windows  \n \n18. The Board also heard evidence of six (6) other incidents of glass falling in Hillview \nRegenc y.24  Upon the cross -examination by the Applicant\u2019s counsel, Mr Leong, of the \nRespondent \u2019s sole witness , Mr Ahmad Ibrahim  Bin Mohd Tahir  (\u201cMr Tahir \u201d), Mr Tahir  \nconfirmed the same and testified as follows:  \n \nMr Leong:  So, at this date in September 201 8, six incidents of glass \nfrom windows have fallen, Did you or your staff report this \nto the police?  \nA. Mr Nayan did report.  Police came down.  \n\u2026 \nDeputy President:  Mr Leong, just for the tribunal\u2019s benefit, when you ask this \nquestion of the witness, you said there were six instances of \nglass falling. Can we have that sorted out so that we are \nclear?  \nMr Leong:  Oh yes, Deputy President.

These four do not include the two that you \nmentioned in your draft email on the 6th of December 2018, \nis that correct?  \nA:  Based on the email, it\u2019s correct.25 \n \n19. Mr Tahir further gave evidence that for one (1) incident of the six  (6) incidents of gl ass \nfalling in the estate , the police was alerted and it was more likely than not that the glass \nwindow had fallen from the upper floor units. The Respondent dealt with all six (6) \ninstances by issuing a notice reminding residents to close their windows du ring heavy rain \nor storms.  He testified:  \n \nA:  We find out aft -- when the police came down, then the \npolice went upstairs.  \nQ.  Yes and then -- \nA.  After that, the y come down and see me, then they mentioned \nthat the slam of the win d. \nQ.  So the police told you that the wind slammed the -- \nA.

And that was one instance, right? Did you call the \npolice for the other five instances?  \nA.  Normally, this case is happened fast, because raining season \nand it\u2019s \u2013 \nQ.  So would you agree that this happens quite freque ntly, that \nglass falls from a highrise onto the bottom units. Because of \nrain and it\u2019s frequent. So there\u2019s no need to report to the \npolice, right, because it happens quite often, are you saying \nthat?  \nA.  I mean we put up the notice to inform the residents  to close \ntheir windows whenever there\u2019s a heavy downpour that kind \n \n25 Supra n 14 at page 150 Line 3 to page 152 Line 7.

And to be frank, that until today, there\u2019s no break \nglass already. It\u2019s the owner responsibility to ensure that the \nglass \u2013 whenever there\u2019s a storm, heavy storm, they need to \nclose the window.  \nQ: So close your windows so that the window doesn\u2019t slam, the \nowner.

I mean at the moment because of the design, that kind of \ndesign in our estate, you know.26 \n \n(c) History of High -Rise Littering  \n \n20. The Board finds that there is evidence of a history of high -rise littering in Hillview \nRegency given that the Respondent had put up a notice to inform / warn reside nts on the \nsame.27 Mr Tahir personally put up the notice which included items like pen and \ncutter/penknife, lighted cigarettes and cigarette boxes, faeces, etc found on ground floor \nareas, balconies, aircon ledges and drains. He agreed that objects thrown from high floors \nare dangerous and can cause harm to anyone below, including children and property.28    \nPolice reports had also been made on the objects falling into the Applicant\u2019s PES, i.e. the \nFlower Pot Incident on 21 May 2021  as well as the two (2) instances of falling ropes,  and \nthere was no evidence from the Respondent to refute t he Flower Pot Incident  beyond \nstating that \u201cinvestigations are ongoing\u201d as stated in paragraph [10] above. The Board also \nnotes that the Mr Tahir a greed that the Applicant\u2019s daughter would have been seriously \nharmed by the flower pot and the debris falling from it . 29  \n \n21. In view of the evidence of the falling objects from high, including the multiple instances \nof shattered windows falling, the flower pot and heavy ropes as well as the history of high -\nrise littering as stated above, the Board f inds on the facts that the  Applicant  has shown, \non a balance of probabilities, that there is evidence  of dangerous objects falling from \nheight  at his PES with a real and not fanciful risk of possible harm caused to his daughter . \n \n22. Whether the risk of possible harm to children is a real and not fanciful one would depend \non the facts of each case. The Board would add that a strong dose of common se nse is \nalways helpful, and when in doubt, to err on the side of caution where safety of children \nis concerned . It would be a sad day when management corporations ignore warning signs \n \n26 Supra n 14 at page 15 3 Line 1 5 to page 154 Line 22.  \n27 Supra n 3 at 30, 231.

The Board heard evidence from Mr Tahir that umbrellas had been used at other units\u2019 PES \nbut even Mr Tahir concedes that  there were no guidelines on these umbrellas and they \nwill not adequately protect  against \u201ckiller litter\u201d  such as glass .  He testified:  \n \nMdm Zahara:  Ok. You gave evidence earlier that in your view, the \numbrella should be --- should offer sufficient protection, \nright?  \nA. I mean for me, it\u2019s to protect the littering.30 \n\u2026 \nMdm Zahara:  Material of the umbrella?  \nA. Yes. Because they got two types, which actually previously \nwe order one local one, and one from the States.  So the \nmaterial totally the price is different.  So we spent that kind \nof different material and it\u2019s proven.  And even actually, we \nalso designed such a way that on top, we made like a small \nhole with another top to get the wind to \u2013 \nMdm Zahara:  This is your guidelines for the umbrella for use by the \u2013 \nA. No, this one \u2013 \nMdm Zahara:  - - second floor units? \nA. Yah, most of the units, they have this centre t o open, to \nmake some \u2013 when the wind they will just - - because the \nproblem is sometimes there\u2019s nobody in the house or the \nflats.  \nMdm Zahara:  Of course, yes. So you are saying that there are guidelines \nissued by MCST, is it, for the type of umbrellas to b e used?  \nA. By right, we just gave umbrella as the sheltered area.  \nMdm Zahara:  So there are no guidelines?  \nA. Don\u2019t have. We open to everyone else to - - we do - -  as \nmentioned just now, the design we don\u2019t really - -  \nMdm Zahara:  Right, so there are no guidelines on the design of the \numbrellas.  \nA. I mean you can put so many,  but must be presentable that \nkind of don\u2019t - - if you put so many, but you don\u2019t maintain \nit also looks so unsightly., which actually we - - \nMdm Zahara:  Okay.  \n \n30 Supra n 14 at page 186 Line s 3-6.

I have encountered people \u2013 they don\u2019t just - - they just \u2013 at \nthe end, they closed the thing, they don\u2019t want to use \nanymore.31   \n\u2026 \nDeputy President:  Okay, earlier we heard evidence that Mr Nayan had \ncomplained that the glass shards had damaged his umbrella \nand I think Mr Leong asked you a question or two on it, and \nyou accepted that the falling glass m ay damage the umbrella \nand can I just ask you, in your view, would the umbrella be \nsufficiently - - would it be a sufficient safety device to \nprotect anyone from falling glass?  \nA, If falling glass, we are talking about canvas, it will still go \nthrough.  I mean it must be the facts. So because it just one \n- - even one pole come down from anywhere also, it just \npoke through.32 \n \n24. It was not disputed between the parties that the Applicant resides in a building comprising \n25 storeys; and has a 10 -year daughter who resides in the Applicant\u2019s unit with PES which \nis within the lot .  In the absence of any guidelines on the installation of any structure / \ndevice at the Applicant\u2019s unit\u2019s PE S for the protection of children , the Board  finds the \nApplicant\u2019s proposal for a retractable awning at his PES to be a necessary , reasonable and \nproportionate response  33 to the risk of dangerous  objects  falling into his PES, which may \nendanger the lif e of the Applicant\u2019s 10-year-old daughter. The installation of a retractable \nawning would be allowed under the said paragraph 5(3)(c) of the BMSMR 2005 as a \nstructure / device to prevent harm to his 10 -year-old daughter from the  risk of the  said \ndangerous objects falling from above.  \n \n25. Notwithstanding the above, th e Board will proceed to consider whether the Respondent \nhad unreasonably refused to consent to the Applicant\u2019s proposal made on 1 December \n2020 on the renovation works for the installation of the retractable awning  at the \nApplicant\u2019s PES  under  section 111 of the BMSMA.   \n \nWhether the respondent had unreasonably refused to consent to the Applicant\u2019s proposal on \n1 December 2020 with respect to the installation of the retractable awning at the Applicant\u2019s \nPES pursuant to section 111 of the BMSMA  \n \n \n31 Supra n 14 at page 188 Line 10 to page 189 Line 18.  \n32 Supra n 14 at page 190 Line s 14-25. \n33 See Pang Loon Ong and others v The MCST Plan No. 4288  [2019] SGSTB 6 at paragraphs [20] -[25] and \nAhmad bin Ibrahim and Others v The MCST Plan No. 4131  [2019] SGSTB 8 at paragraphs [16], [22] and [25].

Besides  the submission of a RWAF for the installation of the said awning as stated in \nparagraph [ 3] above, t he Board noted that with respect to the Applicant\u2019s first request on \n20 September 202 0 for guidelines on the installation of a safety cover over his PES , the \nRespondent had replied that approval via resolution was needed for the covering at the \nApplicant\u2019s PES .34  The Applicant thereafter made a similar re quest  for guidelines on 25 \nSeptember 2020  to which there was no substantive response.35   \n \n27. There were also requests made by the Applicant on 1 November and 4 November 2020  \nfor a cover at his balcony to which the Respondent replied that it was unable to accede to \nthe request in view of the private motion mov ed by the Applicant at the 14th AGM ; that \nthe Respondent would be taking steps to install a CCTV at the Applicant\u2019s balcony to \nverify the incidents of littering at his PES ; and that the Applicant could \u201capply for \nrecourse at Strata Title Board \u201d. 36 \n \n28. In view of above paragraphs [2 6] and [2 7], the Board notes that the Respondent  had taken \nthe position that  approval for installation of retractable awning  must be given by the \ngeneral bod y. This is also as testified by Mr Tahir  as follows:  \n \n\u201cMr Leong:  Yes. An d I am grateful for the tribunal giving me another \nchance as well, because that put question to you is, do you \nthink it\u2019s reasonable, given the history of dangerous objects \nfalling from a highrise in Hillview Regency, do you think \nit\u2019s reasonable for the M CST to just blatantly deny an \napplication for retractable awning.  Do you think it\u2019s \nreasonable?  \nA. Reasonable is what I \u2013 \nDeputy President:  Do you agree, disagree or don\u2019t know, then explain.  \nA. No. Yah, I disagree on that, okay. So can I explain why I \ndisagree?  \nDeputy President:  Yes. \nA. I mean for the retractable awning.  I mean to conduct a \nmajority like we go through AGM, you know.  Then \nEOGM, we go through again, you know.  So, the floor said \ncarry out.  So we would do the next step.  This is what we \nwanted, we got to be fair with the unit below, the unit above, \nfew floors on top.  That\u2019s where we caught in between, we \nstill got to serve all other residents above, second floor and \n \n34 Supra n 3 at 42 -43. \n35 Supra n 3 at 53 -54. \n36 Supra n 3 at 58 -61.

So, the AGM was conducted and was failed, and \nafter that, EOGM gave second chance again, also it was not \ncarried out. So the position now, if I say, \u201cEh, can fix, but I \ngot no authorise to ask them to ask them to go and fix, install \nit.  I just say it must do some thing on the owner\u2019s side, see \nwe can come out with something like okay, we still want to \ndo this, so must have something to prove to us that it\u2019s been \napproved by someone, professional engineering \u2013 engineer \nto give us the drawings or anything which actua lly relevant, \ncan suit the PES area.  Which I think is every \u2013 every \u2013 even \nwe want to do something, we must spend money to \u2013 \nwhether it is worth to do the job.  \nMr Leong:  So you disagree, you say that it\u2019s reasonable for the MCST \nto deny it, because go to general meeting. That\u2019s your \nposition in summary, right?  \nA. That\u2019s what been all the years being doing that.  \nQ. And if there\u2019s harm being done to children, go to general \nmeeting, right?  \nA. I mean I cannot sa y that because at the moment \u2013 \nQ. There\u2019s no harm ye t.  So let\u2019s wait till harm is done to \nchildren, then go to general meeting, is it?  \nA. I mean I am a person to be execute whatever the decision -\nmaking by the MCST towards me.  \nQ. Yes, yes, yes, that\u2019s my point.  \nA. It\u2019s that it\u2019s just direction only, okay.  If the Board find that \nthe MCST need to do what you\u2019ve been telling me all this \nwhile, so for all means.  I mean we also wan t to have the \ndirection also.  \nQ. Because MCST says \u201cI don\u2019t have power even if safety is \nan issue\u201d, right?  Is that the posit ion. Go to general meeting. \nIs that the position?  \nA. At the moment, anything you want to do, you need to get \napproval.   \nQ. From general meeting, anything you want to do must get \nfrom general meeting?  \nA. Must see case by case.  It doesn\u2019t mean like everythi ng you \nwant to do, go general meeting.  \nQ. So some things no need to general meeting, some things go \nto general meeting. But safety must go.

Further, Mr  Tahir testified that the Respondent knew under paragraph 5(3) of BMSMR \n2005 the Applicant  could install the retractable awnings for his daughter\u2019s safety but \nexplained that this contradicted another section in the legislation requiring the Applicant \nto go  the general assembly to seek its approval : \n \nQ: Page 85, and that particular passage I want to refer you to \nsays:  \n \u201cWe have also recently advised by BCA in late December \n2020 that MCST shall refer to Sections 37(3) and 37(4) of \nthe BMSMA, aside from paragr aph 5(3) of the prescribed \nby-laws of the regulations.\u201d   \n Can you tell me what paragraph 5(3) of the regulations say?  \nA.

And in this letter, it refers to paragraph 5(3) of the  \nregulations, you say that, \u201cWe have been advised that we \nshall refer to Sections  37(3) and 37(4), aside from paragraph \n5(3) says?  \nA.

Nishad Ahmad Narod v   STB No. 80 of 20 21 (Hillview Regency)  \nThe MCST Plan No. 3044    \n \n17 \n what paragraph  5(3) says?  It\u2019s okay.  I think the clear \nanswer is you don\u2019t know. Paragraph 5(3) says - -  paragraph \n5(3) provides the subsidiary proprietor, my client, with the \nabilit y to install structures or devices to prevent harm to \nchildren.  Does that surprise you? I am saying to you there\u2019s \na rule in paragraph 5(3) that allows my client to install \nstructures or devices to prevent harm to his child.  Do you \nknow there\u2019s such a ru le? \nA. Yes. \nQ. You know there\u2019s such a rule?  \nA. Yah, it\u2019s my concern that\u2019s a rule for that under the \nBMSMA.  \nQ. Yes. But earlier, you have said that no, must go to general \nmeeting.  \nA. No, general meeting is to get the current, I mean the motion \nto be carri ed out, to get the floor to approve for the \u2013 \nQ. So you don\u2019t know what rule 5(3) says. Because rule 5(3) \nsays he can install it and doesn\u2019t need to go to general \nmeeting.  \nA. That one a bit contradicting, because I\u2019m not sure.  For me, \nit\u2019s the by -law for the BMS is still there.  But after what we \nhave to do under this \u2013 and another section which actually \nwe must go through to the floor for the approval.  \nQ. So you see, you don\u2019t know.  Or you are sure that need to \ngo to the general meeting?  \nA. Yah, anything to install or anything to be done, I mean \u2013 \nQ. So you don\u2019t know what rule 5(3) says, because rule 5(3) \nsays he can install it without going to general meeting, but \nyet you made him go to general meeting, right?  \nA. This one, this one I don\u2019t comme nt this one. I can\u2019t \ncomment this one.38 \n \n30. The Respondent can be taken to have  conceded that the safety of the Applicant\u2019s child is \nat stake when  very late in the course of these proceedings  on 7 December 2021  after the \nAEIC deadline of 2 December 2021 which the Applicant complied with , it belatedly  \nproposed for the Applicant \u201c to install \u201cinvisible\u201d tightly knitted wire netting (or the \nlikes) ...placed or erected horizontally above Mr. Nishad or your PES area instead, as a \nviable, reasonable and effective  safety device for Mr. Nishad and your child\u2019s safety \u2026\u201d39 \n \n38 Supra n 14 at page 173 Line 8 to page 176 Line 5.  \n39 Supra n 3 at 215 at paragraph [2]. Nishad Ahmad Narod v   STB No. 80 of 20 21 (Hillview Regency)  \nThe MCST Plan No. 3044    \n \n18 \n  \n31. The Board notes the Respondent\u2019s understanding  of killer litter as stated in paragraph [6] \nabove  is misguided . As per paragraph [ 13] above, the rationale for  paragraph  5(3)(c) of \nthe 2nd Schedule of the BMSMR 2005 is the protection of children, and children can be \nharmed by falling objects from height regardless whether someone has intentionally \nthrown them down or not and whether or not the person has actually been identified, as \nthe fac ts of the present case show .  To that extent, the Board agrees with the Applicant\u2019s \nsubmission that the Respondent had abdicated its responsibility to ensure the safety of the \nApplicant\u2019s daughter to the general assembly.40 \n \n32. The Resp ondent  should have considered the exception under paragraph 5(3)(c) of the 2nd \nSchedule of the BMSMR 2005  in deciding whether to consent to the Applicant\u2019s RWAF \nfor the installation of the retractable awning at the Applicant\u2019s PES  without the need to \ngo the gene ral assembly to seek its approval.41  \n \n33. In so far as the Respondent\u2019s remaining objection was premised on section 33 of the \nBMSMA, this was incorrect as the provision is not triggered where there is a real and not \nfanciful risk of  possible  harm to children and the proposed structure to be installed to \nprevent the said harm is a necessary, reasonable and proportionate response. Of course, \nthe Applicant cannot install any structure he wishes and wash his hands off thereafter. \nParagraphs 5(4) and 5(5) of the 2nd Schedule of the BMSMR 2005 provide the requisite \nbalance to an SP\u2019s right to install a safety device under paragraph 5(3)(c) of the 2nd \nSchedule of the BMSMR 2005 with the interests of the management corporation  in that  \nthe structure must be installed i n a competent and proper manner and must have an \nappearance, after it has been installed, in keeping with such guidelines as the management \ncorporation may prescribe regarding such installations, and with the appearance of the \nrest of the building.  The SP  must also maintain the structure and repair any damage \ncaused to common property by the installation and subsequent removal of the structure, \nnotwithstanding that it may form part of common property . \n \n34. The Respondent had  therefore taken into account  an irrelevant consideration  in \nwithholding its approval to the Applicant\u2019s application in his RWAF for the installation \nof an awning at his PES . The Board therefore finds the Respondent to have acted \nunreasonably and orders the Respondent to approve  the Applicant\u2019s application for the \ninstallation of a retractable awning at his PES and to provide the necessary guidelines in \naccordance with paragraph 5(4) of the Second Schedule of the BMSMR 2005  within \nforty -five (45) days of this Order . \n \n \n40 Supra n 29 at par agraphs [36] to [39].  \n41 Supra n 29 at paragraphs [34] and [35].  Nishad Ahmad Narod v   STB No. 80 of 20 21 (Hillview Regency)  \nThe MCST Plan No. 3044    \n \n19 \n 35. The Board notes that the Respondent had submitted a 70 -page closing submission on 25 \nJanuary 2022 well past the deadline  of 13 January 2022  and just two ( 2) days before the \ndelivery of the Board\u2019s decision. The contents  suggest there is animosity between the \nRespondent council and the Applicant in their dealings over the issue of the awning \nrequest. The Board in coming to its decision relies solely on the evidence adduced  by way \nof the affidavits of the parties and the a rbitration hearing. We would urge subsidiary \nproprietors and council members to put personal feelings aside and focus on the real issues \nat stake in a rational and calm manner, and not let that be side -tracked by personal feelings . \n \n36. The Board wishes to remind management corporations  like the Respondent to play a more \nactive role where children\u2019s safety is concerned and provide guidelines for its subsidiary \nproprietors  pertaining to the installation of device s to prevent harm to childr en. The Board \nwishes to draw the Respondent\u2019s attention to another Strata Titles Board\u2019s  decision in Zou \nXiong v MCST Plan No. 2360 [2017] SGSTB 5  (an application where the subsidiary \nproprietor applied to  install invisible grilles at his balcony pursuant  to section 111(b) of \nthe BMSMA)  at paragraphs [31] \u2013[32] as follows:  \n \n\u201c31. The Respondent submits that it cannot give approval for the Applicant\u2019s \napplication to install invisible grilles because the proposed works affect the fa\u00e7ade \nof the building and such approval is to be given by the general body and not by the \nRespondent.  T he Board takes the view that this reasoning is unsatisfactory because \nit is within the Respondent\u2019s power to give such approval. It is the Respondent\u2019s \nrole to put in place a set of design guidelines for the installation of safety grilles \nthat address both  the safety issues and the issues regarding the fa\u00e7ade of the \nDevelopment, so that the subsidiary proprietors can comply with such guidelines. \nWhere there is no design guidelines, the subsidiary proprietor\u2019s application for the \ninstallation of invisible gr illes have to be decided on a case -by-case basis.  In \nexercising its power, the Respondent should not defer its responsibility to the \ngeneral body.  \n \n32.\u2026.Even if the Respondent\u2019s position was correct, the Respondent should have \nadopted a more active role t o facilitate the Applicant in his application, especially \nin a case such as this where children\u2019s safety is concerned . The Respondent ought \nto take the initiative to provide guidelines for its subsidiary proprietors and it is not \nfor the Applicant to initi ate an approval for such guidelines .\u201d \n \nBoard\u2019s Order (s) \n \n37.

In the case, applications were filed by the subsidiary proprietors (\u201c the SPs \u201d) of #XXX  and \n#XXX   (STB 25 of 2021) in the development known as Aljunied Industrial Complex and by \nthe management corporation (\u201c the MC \u201d) of the  development (STB 36 of 2021) i n relation    \n   \nKoh Tian Soon and Tan Muay Lan                     STB No. 25 and 36  of 202 1  \nv The Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 826    (Aljunied Industrial Complex)\n   \nPage 3 of 9 \n to legal fees incurred by the MC when enforcing a breach of the by -laws on the part of the \nSPs when they installed CCTV cameras on the external wall of their units without approval \nfrom the MC.  \n2. There were other prayers in the two (2) application s - when the applications were filed , the \nSPs had prayed for four (4) orders and the MC had prayed for five (5) orders. The SPs filed \nan interlocutory application to make an amendment to their application and whilst an \ninterlocutory application was not fil ed on the part of the MC to amend, the parties in the \ncourse of mediation/directions agreed that only orders in relation to legal fees would be \nsought from the Board.  \nBACKGROUND  \n3. From the submissions filed , the following facts were not in dispute  \n3.1 The SPs are subsidiary proprietors of two ( 2) units viz # XXX  and # XXX  in Aljunied \nIndustrial Complex. The units are tenanted to a company viz KTK Beauty Pte Ltd and \nthe SPs are the directors and shareholders of the company. References to the SPs in \nthese grounds will include the tenants.  \n3.2 Inter alia, the following by -laws and resolutions were passed by the MC:  \n3.2.1 22 June 1999 - MCST Plan 826 By  - Laws  (\u201cthe MC By -laws \u201d) \n\u201c3.14: Occupiers/Tenants shall not make any additions/alterations to the \nfa\u00e7ade and windows of their units without prior written approval of the \nManagement Corporation. Any alteration/replacement of the windows must \nfollow the common designs as specified by  the Management Corporation \u201d \n3.2.2  28th Annual General Meeting (\u201c AGM \u201d) on 27  April 20 12 - By-Law on \nEncroachment of Common Areas ( \u201cthe Encroachment By -laws \u201d) \n\u201c\u2026to empower the management corporation in the event of a breach or \nviolation of the By-Laws, to take such action as it considers appropriate under \nthe circumstances.... \u201d \n\u201cAll expenses and costs arising from or in connection with or from the action \ntaken...shall be borne by the subsidiary proprietor \u201d \n3.2.3 Special Resolution passed on 28  May 2015  \n\u201cTo authorise the Management Council to approve applications by Subsidiary \nProprietors/Tenants to install CCTV/Sign Boards (with or without \nillumination) within the common areas on a case to case basis and as deemed \nfit by the Management Committe e. The Management Committee shall reserve \nthe rights to disapprove any applications without providing any reasons \u201d \n3.2.4 Resolution passed at 33rd AGM on 2 June 2017  \n\u201c6.2 It was unanimously resolved that where a subsidiary proprietor or \noccupier of a lot has bre ached any\u2026by -laws passed \u2026and /or defaulted in \npayment of any contributions levied\u2026and or interest thereon and where the \nManagement Corporation incurs any cost fees or expenses whatso ever in    \n   \nKoh Tian Soon and Tan Muay Lan                     STB No. 25 and 36  of 202 1  \nv The Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 826    (Aljunied Industrial Complex)\n   \nPage 4 of 9 \n enforcing \u2026the Management Corporation shall recover all such cos ts\u2026on an \nindemnity basis \u201d \n3.2.5 Resolutions passed at the 34th AGM on 31  August 2018  \n8.0 Legal Action and Recovery of Legal Fees  \n8.1 Arrears in Contributions.  \n\u201cThe meeting resolved that all legal fees including those on solicitor -and-client \nbasis, disbursements and all other costs, charges and expenses incurred in the \nrecovery of arrears of any contributions or such other sums owing to the \nmanagement corporation by any subsidiary proprietor be recovered on full \nindemnity basis from the subsidiary pr oprietor concerned \u201d \n 8.2 Breach of By -laws.  \n\u201cThe meeting resolved that where a subsidiary proprietor or occupier of a lot \nhas breached any prescribed by -laws set out in the Second Schedule of the \nBuilding Maintenance (Strata Management) Regulations 2005 an d/or \nbreached any by -laws passed by the management corporation at it general \nmeetings and where the management corporation incurs any costs, fee or \nexpenses whatsoever in enforcing the said by -laws, the management \ncorporation shall recover as a debt all su ch costs, fee and expenses from the \nsubsidiary proprietor or occupier on full indemnity basis \u201d \n4. In and around February 2019, four (4) security cameras were installed outside the SPs \u2019 units. \nThe cameras were, according to the SPs, to ensure safety of the vehicles parked in the \ncommon carpark.  \n5. On 1 March 2019, the SPs were, by way of a letter sent by Absolute Properties Pte Ltd,  for \nand on behalf of the MC , advised to remove the camera s within seven ( 7) working days \nfailing which legal proceeding against you will be commenced without further recourse. The \nSPs did not reply or respond.  \n6. Via a letter dated 2 April 2019, a  demand was made by the MC for the cameras to be removed \nby 16  April 2019, inter alia, on the ground that the SPs had in breach of the MC By -laws \nfailed to obtain prior written approval for the installation; and the installation contravened \nsection 37(3) o f the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act Cap 30C (\u201cthe Act \u201d) \nbecause it affected the appearance of the building. The demand was made in a letter sent by \nlawyers acting for the MC . \n7. On 17  April 2019 , the SPs via their lawyers contended that the c ameras were required for \nreasons including security; that there was no basis for the contention that the cameras had \naffected the appearance of the building; highlighted that others had installed cameras on \nexternal walls and no action had been taken against them. The SPs in the last paragraph of \nthe letter informed that they would on a without prejudice basis and without any admission \nof liability whatsoever and to close the chapter on your client\u2019 s demands , unfounded as they \nmay be, our client has already removed the camera portions of the CCTVs\u2026.     \n   \nKoh Tian Soon and Tan Muay Lan                     STB No. 25 and 36  of 202 1  \nv The Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 826    (Aljunied Industrial Complex)\n   \nPage 5 of 9 \n 8. There is no dispute that the cameras were removed, but it appeared to be the case that the \nbrackets of the cameras had not been removed at the same time and on or about 3 June 2019, \nthe MC\u2019s lawyers informed the SP\u2019s lawyers that the brackets had to be removed and \nconsequential repairs carried out by 17  June 2019 . There is no dispute that the brackets were \nremoved and whilst there is no evidence as to the date when they were removed, there is no \nevidence that the MC had to ask or demand removal of the same after the  deadline date.  \n9. On 17 June 2019, t he SPs by way of a letter from their lawyers, inter alia requests that your \nclient forthwith drop its objections to and do approve the installation of the 4 CCTV \nCameras . The MC did not reply.  \n10. Via a letter dated 12  Novembe r 2019 , a claim for $11,374.52 was made by the MC against \nthe SPs as costs, fees or expenses incurred in enforcing the by -laws. It was the contention of \nthe MC that it was entitled to claim all costs, fees and expenses incurred in enforcing the by -\nlaws as a debt (from the SPs) on a full indemnity basis. This is pursuant to, inter alia the \nfollowing provisions (the MC referred to the resolutions passed at the 33rd and 34th AGM  of \nMCST 826 and By -law No 1 of the Encroachment By -laws) which you should already be \naware of. A demand was then made for payment of the $11,374.52 being the costs \nincurred\u2026in enforcing the by -laws.  \n11. Between 2 August 2019 and 22  October 2019 , the MC\u2019s lawyers sent invoices and a credit \nnote to the MC for the amount that the MC had deman ded from the SPs in the 12  November \n2019 letter. The lawyers had billed the MC for professional services rendered between 17  \nApril 2019 and 8  September 2019 . \n12. On 26  November 2019 , the SPs, by way of a letter from their lawyers, inter alia replied that \nthere was no basis for the claim for legal costs and that the amount claimed was excessive . \n13. Between 1 January 2020 and 1 January 2021,  the MC included the legal fees in the \nInvoice/Statement that w ere sent to the SPs in relation to contributions to the management \nand sinking funds ($5687.26 for each of the SPs\u2019 two  (2) units) . \n14. The SPs are in this case applying for  \n\u201cAn order that the MCST be restrained from claiming from them for the Legal Fees \n(comprising of the sums of S$5,687.26 and S$5,687.26); and  \nAn order that the MCST shall amend or remove or do all that is necessary so that the legal \nfees of $5,687.26 is not reflected in the In voices Account No. 623 -05-02 dated 1 April 2020; \n1 July 2020; 1 October 2020; and 1 January 2021 and the legal fees of S$5,687.26 in Invoice \nAccount No. 623 -05-04 dated 1 April 2020; 1 July 2020; 1 October 2020; 1 January 2021 \nissued by the MCST \u201d \n15. The MC is  applying for  \n\u201cAn order that the SPs shall bear all expenses and costs arising from or in connection with \nor from the action taken by the MC in respect of the SPs\u2019 installation of the CCTV Cameras \nin the amount of S$11,374.52, or such other amount as the S TB deems fit.  \nAn order that the SPs shall bear the costs of the Consolidated Application, including the    \n   \nKoh Tian Soon and Tan Muay Lan                     STB No. 25 and 36  of 202 1  \nv The Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 826    (Aljunied Industrial Complex)\n   \nPage 6 of 9 \n legal costs and expenses incurred by the MC on a full indemnity basis, or on such basis as \nthe STB deems fit.  \nSuch further or other orders and/or relief  as the STB deems fit \u201d \nTHE SPS\u2019  APPLICATIONS  \n16. It was the submission of the SPs that the MC should be restrained from claiming the legal \ncosts becaus e (i) there was no breach of the by -laws or section 37(3) of the Act;                                  \nii) no  legal basis for the MC to make a claim for the legal costs; and iii) even if there was a \nlegal basis for the claim it was excessive and disproportionate.  \nInter alia , it was submitted that the legal costs claimed included work done by the lawyers \nfor work done between 4 June 2019 and 9 September 2019 when there were no matters in \nconnection with the cameras outstanding.  \n17. In relation to \u201c no breach of the by -laws and section 37(3) of the Act \u201d, it was the submission \nof the SPs that there was no breach of the MC By -laws because the installation of the cameras \nwas not an alteration to the fa\u00e7ade and it did not affect the appearance of the building.  \n18. The Board was satisfie d that the installation of the cameras had altered the fa\u00e7ade of the \nbuilding and affected the appearance of the building  \n19. Submissions of the SPs that they were not aware that the MC\u2019s consent was required before \ninstalling the cameras; that other subsidiar y proprietors installed cameras and no action had \nbeen taken by the MC were not relevant to the fact that there was a breach of the MC By -\nlaws when the cameras were installed.  \n20. In relation  to the submission that there was no legal basis for the claim of leg al costs the SPs \npointed out that the MC was relying on the Encroachment By -laws and the resolutions passed \nat the 33rd and 34th AGMs.  \n21. It was submitted that the Encroachment By -laws did not provide for a recovery of full legal \ncosts when there was a breac h of the by -laws and only provided for the actions that the MC \ncould take when there was a breach. In respect of expenses and costs , the SPs accepted that \nwhilst the by -law was a contract between the management corporation and subsidiary \nproprietors and pr ovided for the recovery of all expenses and costs arising from or in \nconnection with or from the action taken by the  MC, it did not provide the MC with a right \nto recover the actual legal costs on an indemnity basis which was what the MC was seeking \nin this case. As for the resolutions passed at the 33rd and 34th AGMs , these were decisions \nmade at the respective meeting s and not a record of an agreement on the part of subsidiary \nproprietors to pay costs i .e. they were not by -laws.  \n22. The SPs also submitted that even if there was a legal basis for the claim for costs, the amount \nclaimed, when considering the work done by the  lawyers was excessive and \ndisproportionate.  \n    \n   \nKoh Tian Soon and Tan Muay Lan                     STB No. 25 and 36  of 202 1  \nv The Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 826    (Aljunied Industrial Complex)\n   \nPage 7 of 9 \n THE MC \u2019S APPLICATIONS  \n23. When STB 36 of 2021 was filed by the MC , it informed that the $11,374.52 was costs \nincurred in enforcing the by -laws against the SPs (Form 8 Para graph  17)  and it was applying \nfor an order from the Board because the SPs are liable to indemnify the Applicant for the  \nentire costs of enforcement pursuant to the by -laws and resolutions passed (Form 8 Para graph  \n24 to 28). It did not in the written submissio ns of the MC appear that it was, in respect of the \nfirst order applied for, submitting that an order should be made by the Board for the SPs to \npay because of a liability under the by -laws and the resolutions. During mediation, the \nattention of the parties  had been drawn to the decision of the Board in MCST Plan 3127 v \nTay Boon Yong [2018] SGSTB 2 ( \u201cTay Boon Yong \u201d) where a by -law that \u201c all costs, \nincluding legal costs on an indemnity basis, disbursements and incidental costs incurred by \nthe management corpo ration to enforce or to  try to enforce any party\u2019 s compliance with the \nBuilding Maintenance & Strata Management Act, other statutes, subsidiary legislation, by -\nlaw shall be recoverable from the party concerned .\u201d was considered. The management \ncorporation s ubmitted that this by -law amounted to a contractually binding clause between \nsubsidiary proprietors and the management corporation and that the Board should award \ncosts on an indemnity basis. The Board at paragraphs [11] and [12] pronounced   \n\u2026the Board is of the view that nothing in the provisions of BMSMA indicates that the MCST \nis empowered to pass by -laws which would interfere with the discretionary powers to award \ncosts under section 117 of the BMSMA  \nWe are of the opinion that even if the 8th AGM by -law was passed by the subsidiary \nproprietors, the presence or existence of such by laws relating to the recovery basis of legal \ncosts would not bind or restrict the Board\u2019 s discretion to award costs under section 117 of \nthe BMSMA  \u2026\u201d \n24. Whilst it was n ot the submission of the MC that the SPs should be ordered to bear all the \nexpenses and costs because they were required or obliged to do so by the by -laws and \nresolutions, it was submitted that the Board should exercise its discretion and order the SPs \nto do so because they had agreed to do so and the agreement should be upheld unless it was \nmanifestly unjust to so. It was submitted that it is just in the circumstances for the SPs to be \nliable for all the costs incurred by the MC given their unreasonable a nd wanton conduct of \nwilfully breaching the by -laws.  \n25. It would be in order to note that whilst the SPs had not responded immediately to the advice \nand demands in relation to the removal of the cameras and were initially opposed to removal, \nthey had complie d without exceptional delay. It was not the finding of the Board that the \nconduct of the SPs was unreasonable and wanton when they breached the by -law. \n26. As an alternative to the application for the SPs to bear all the expenses and costs amounting \nto $11,374 .52, the MC had applied for the Board to make an order for the SPs to pay such \nother amount as the STB deems fit. In response to the SPs \u2019 submission that this was in essence \nan application for an order to \u201ctax\u201d the legal fees , the MC replied that it was no t asking the \nBoard to review its bill of costs but was leaving it to the Board to determine reasonable costs.     \n   \nKoh Tian Soon and Tan Muay Lan                     STB No. 25 and 36  of 202 1  \nv The Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 826    (Aljunied Industrial Complex)\n   \nPage 8 of 9 \n 27. The submission of the MC in its application for the second  (2nd) order i .e. for the SPs to bear \nthe costs of STB 25 and 36 of 2021 incurred by the MC on a full  indemnity basis or on such \nbasis as the STB deems fit was that the SPs should be ordered to pay (i) $5000 as costs \nthrown away when the orders initially applied for were w ithdrawn and new orders \nintroduced; and (ii) $25,000 as costs for STB 25 and 36 of 2021 . \nDECISION OF THE BOARD  \n28. The installation of the CCTV cameras was an addition/alteration to the fa\u00e7ade of the SP\u2019s \nunits and there was a breach of the MC By -laws. Accordi ngly, it was in order for the MC to \nrequire that they be removed and whilst the SPs had not complied immediately, the necessary \nwas done and there was no evidence that they were going to object to the removal. By virtue \nof the Encroachment By -law, the SPs had agreed that they would bear all expenses and costs \narising from the enforcement on the part of the MC. The MC now wants an order for the SPs \nto pay $11,374.52 as expenses and costs. The application is for the Board to make an order \nfor the SPs to pay t he legal costs incurred by the MC when it had appointed lawyers in \nrelation to the SPs breach of the MC By -laws.  \n29. The Board is a statutory body established for the settlement of disputes with jurisdiction and \npowers identified in the Act and the types of orders that it can make are set out in Part VI \nDivision 2 of the Act. It cannot make determinations on matters over  which the Act has not \ngiven it any jurisdiction. The MC did not submit that there was a provision in the Act that \nprovided for the making of the order that it was seeking. It was its \u2019 submission that the Board \nhas a discretion to make the order applied for and it would be just in the circumstances of \nthis case for the order to be made.  \n30. Under section 117 of the Act , the Board can make an order for costs to be paid by the \napplicant, a management corporation, a subsidiary management corporation or any person \nagainst who m the order is made or costs to be paid by a party for making a frivolous \napplication to the Board . In Tay Boon Yong , it was the decision of the Board at paragraph \n[9] that the discretionary power to award costs arose once a Board has made a determination \nregarding the matters before  them i.e. the Board has powers to award costs in connection \nwith matters before the Board.  \n31. The application of the MC for the Board to order the SPs to pay its legal costs in this case \nwas not an application in connection with a matter or any matter that was pending when the \ncosts were incurred. The application (STB 36 of 2021) was filed on 30  March 2021 when \nthere were no outstanding matters in connection with the CCTV cameras. The claim for the \nlegal fees that had been incurre d was in respect of a contractual obligation that was based on \na by -law. The SPs have not and had never accepted the validity of the claim and a \ndetermination will have to be made as to whether the SPs are liable to pay the $11,374.52 \nclaimed by the MC. A determination as to whether the by -law is enforceable or not is, as \npointed out in the Board in Tay Boon Yong at  paragraph  [13] for another forum to decide.  \n32. The Board is not aware and it has not been shown that there are any provisions in the Act \nthat allo ws for the Board to make an order for a subsidiary proprietor or anyone to pay the \nmanagement corporation or anyone legal costs incurred in matters that were not before the    \n   \nKoh Tian Soon and Tan Muay Lan                     STB No. 25 and 36  of 202 1  \nv The Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 826    (Aljunied Industrial Complex)\n   \nPage 9 of 9 \n Board. Accordingly, the application of the MC for the SPs to pay the costs and expe nses in \nthe amount of $11,374.52 or such other amount is dismissed.  \n33. Regarding the orders applied for by the SPs, they had breached the by -law in relation to \naddition/alteration of the fa\u00e7ade. Whilst the Board does not have the power to order that legal \nfees incurred by the MC to be paid by them, there is no reason whatsoever for the Board to \nmake an order (assuming that it has the power to do so) to restrain the MC for making a \nclaim against them. The application for an order to restrain the MC from claiming legal fees \nis dismissed.  \n34. The legal fees of $11,374.52 incurred by the MC have been included in invoices dated \nbetween 1 January 2020 and 1 January 2021. Whilst the Board has dismissed the application \nof the MC for the Board to make an order for th e SPs to pay the legal fees and the \nconsequence of this is that there is, at this point of time, no obligation for the SPs to pay the \nlegal fees, the Board is not aware and it has not been shown that it has the power to order the \nMC to amend or remove the legal fees from the invoices that were issued between 1 January \n2020 and 1 January 2021 . The application to amend or remove the legal fees from the \ninvoices is dismissed.  \n35. The SPs and the MC have not succeeded in any of their primary applications and it wil l be \nappropriate that the Board should make no order for costs . \nDated this  30th day of  July 2021           \n  _______________________  \nMr Remedios F.G  \nDeputy President  \n_______________________  \nMr Lai Huen Poh  \nMember  \n_______________________  \nProfessor Teo Keang Sood  \nMember  \n   Mr Collin Choo  (Tan Peng Chin LLC ) for the  SPs. \nMr Nicholas Tan and Ms Tai Ai Lin (Allen & Gledhill LLP ) for the MC.

He is a subsidiary proprietor (\u201cSP\u201d) of the development \ncalled The Balmoral.  \n2 The Respondent is the MCST Plan No. 1374.  \n3 The dispute between the parties was heard by the Board over several days in July 2019. \nThe Board rendered its decision  on 31 July 2019 (\u201c1st Decision\u201d). The Applicant appealed \nagainst the 1st Decision. Th e High Court found that the RC Flat Roof and the Awning \nwere common propert ies, reversing the finding of the Board and remit ted the matter back Raman Dhir  v MCST Plan No. 1374                           STB No. 8 of 2019 ( The Balmoral ) \nPage 3 of 11 \n to the Board to consider the presumption under section 101(8) of the Building \nMaintenance and Strata Management Act (\u201cBMSMA\u201d) in coming to its decision on the \nApplicant\u2019s claim.  \n4 The rehearing was heard in July 2020 and the Board\u2019s decision was rendered on 29 July \n2020 (\u201c2nd Decision\u201d).  \n5 The Applicant appealed against the 2nd Decision and the High Court directed the \nfollowing four matters to be remitted back to the Board for the present rehearing. The \nfour matters are:  \n(a) Whether the presumption under section 101(8) of the BMSMA applies  to the \nRC Flat Roof;  \n(b) The Applicant\u2019s claim in respect of the external wall joint of the 4th storey \nbalcony and external ceiling board below the 4th storey balcony;  \n(c) The Applicant\u2019s claim of $700 for the repairs done to the Fixed Windows; and  \n(d) The issue of costs.  \n6 At the directions hearing for th is rehearing, the Board noticed that the item in [5(b)] above \nappeared to be a new matter that had not been raised by the Applicant before in the first \nappeal . The Board directed parties to address that point in their written submissions because \nthe Board ha d no knowledge if the High Court wa s aware of this fact . \n7 The Board has read the submissions of both parties and will rehear the item in [5(b)]  as the \nHigh Court ha d knowledge of this and had directed the Board to rehear it . \n \n Raman Dhir  v MCST Plan No. 1374                           STB No. 8 of 2019 ( The Balmoral ) \nPage 4 of 11 \n THE RC FLAT ROOF  \n8 There was a misunderstanding as to whether the enclosed space under the RC Flat Roof \ncontained any rooms. An undated photograph tendered  by the Applicant showing water \nstains on the ceiling under the RC Flat Roof was rejected by the Board  as the said undat ed \nphotograph was described as a room  in level 3 by Applicant\u2019s contractor. This has n ow \nbeen clarified by a joint inspection  in 2021 as suggested by the High Court.  The undated \nphoto graph  in fact showed  water  stains on the ceiling of a room directly under  the RC \nFlat roof and not a room on the 3rd level.  \n9 However, t here w ere no signs of dampness, moisture or water penetration on the ceiling \ndirectly below the RC Flat Roof on the day of a joint inspection on 22 June 2018 \naccording to witness Kalai , who was t he property site manager . He was under oath and \nthe Board had no reason to doubt him. The Applicant had also  allegedly  claimed that he \nhad painted over the ceiling. There was no mistake or a misunderstanding here.  \n10 As there was this undated photograph showing  water  stains on the ceiling  under the RC \nFlat Roof , there must have been some leak ages from the RC Flat Roof into the ceiling \nsometime before 22 June 2018.  \n11 Accordingly, the Board finds that the presumption applies to this area . The Respo ndent \nis responsible to make good the damages caused to the areas directly below the RC Flat \nRoof. The Respondent will reimburse the Applicant for the cost of repairs done to the \nabove said areas ( i.e. the ceiling and the walls).   \n12 The Respondent is disput ing the quantum of repair. The Board is of the view that it is too \nlate in the day to raise this. As we had said before, the Respondent had been reluctant to \ndo the repairs and the Applicant had no choice but to go ahead himself. It is also not in Raman Dhir  v MCST Plan No. 1374                           STB No. 8 of 2019 ( The Balmoral ) \nPage 5 of 11 \n the inte rest of both parties , in our view, to go for cost ly assessment, in the circumstances \nof this case.  However, the Boa rd\u2019s problem is that the Applicant had referred to an invoice \nfor $4,100 as the cost of repairs. The Respondent had rightly objected on the grounds  that \nthe said invoice was for \u201c Painting Works \u2026 To apply wall fillers and new paintwork \nusing Nippon Vinilex Paint. Wall Painting using Nippon Vinilex Paint. To reinstate \noriginal colour wall paint coat to Entranceway, Lvl 1 and Lvl 2 \u201d. 1 The Applicant had \nnot referred the Board to any other invoice.  \n13 The Applicant will have to provide some other evidence that t he $4,100 of repairs was \nfor the damaged areas under the RC Flat Roof  and not elsewhere .   \n14 As the Applicant is asking for reimbursement, it is  therefore  necessary for the Applicant \nto show so me proof that the amount in the  invoice had been fully paid by hi m.  \nTHE EXTERNAL CEILING BOARD AND THE EXTERNAL WALL JOINT  \n15 Section 2(1) of the BMSMA provides as follows:  \n\u201c\u201ccommon property\u201d, subject to subsection  (9), means  \u2014 \n(a) in relation to any land and building comprised or to be comprised in a strata \ntitle plan, such part of the land and building \u2014 \n(i) not comprised in any lot or proposed lot in that strata title plan; and  \n(ii) used or capable of being used or enjoyed by occupiers of 2 or more lots \nor proposed lots;  \n(b) in relation to any other land and building, such  part of the land and building \u2014 \n(i) not comprised in any non -strata lot; and  \n \n1 Affidavit of evidence -in-chief  (\u201cAEIC\u201d)  of Raman Dhir, at pg 162.

Raman Dhir  v MCST Plan No. 1374                           STB No. 8 of 2019 ( The Balmoral ) \nPage 7 of 11 \n (d) A central air\u2011conditioning system and its appurtenances, and a fire \nsprinkler protection system an d its appurtenances.  \n(e) Any chute, pipe, wire, cable, duct or facility for the passage or \nprovision of water, sewage, drainage, gas, oil, electricity, telephone, \nradio, television, garbage, heating or cooling systems, or any other \nsimilar services .\u201d \n16 An extern al wall joint is actually the area where two external walls joined. External walls \nare common propert ies and logically it follows that the joined area of the two common \nproperties  must necessarily be common property as well. We find that the external wall \njoint is a common property. It is also our view, which we had previously stated, that the \npresumption under section 101(8) of the BMSMA does not apply to lateral seepages ( i.e. \nthrough windows or walls). Therefore,  it does not apply to external wall joints  as well.  \n17 The 4th storey  balcony  floor  is a private strata area of the unit2.  \n18 There is no definition of \u201cfacade\" in the BMSMA. The ordinary meaning  of \u201cfacade\u201d is \ndefined as  \u201cthe front  of a building \u201d in the Oxford Advanced Learner\u2019s Dictionary.  The \nexternal walls and other structures facing outwards can be said to be the unit\u2019s facade,  \nhowever the piece of  suspended  ceiling board which is situated below the  soffit  of the \nbalcony slab is questionable.   Not everything visible from outside made up the facade of \nthe unit. Also, the piece of  suspended  ceiling board is not a structural element as \nenvisaged by section 2(1) of the BMSMA . \n19 \u201cStructu ral element \u201d, as defined in section 2 (1) of the BMSMA:  \n \n2 See AEIC of Low Lee Luang . Raman Dhir  v MCST Plan No. 1374                           STB No. 8 of 2019 ( The Balmoral ) \nPage 8 of 11 \n \u201c\u2026 for a bu ilding, means an internal or external load -bearing component of the \nbuilding that is essential to the stability of the building or part of the building, but \ndoes not include any door or window \u201d. \n \n20 However, the Board  is of the view that there is no necessity  to define the  piece of  \nsuspended  ceiling board  to be a common property or not within the meaning of section \n2(1) of the BMSMA to decide liability.  \n21 On the evidence available before the Board, there were only two  possible s ources of \nleakage that could have caused the damages to the  suspended  ceiling board. On e is from \nthe balcony floor directly above the  suspended  ceiling board  and the other from the \nexternal wall joint . \n22 The Board noted that there was grouting  carried out to the external wall joint, but this did \nnot mean that the wall or the wall joint itself was structurally defective and the balcony \nfloor  slab was no t defective. For the rainwater to seep through the external wall joint and \ninto the ceiling void and punch a big hole in the  suspended  ceiling board was probably \nunlikely given the extent of the water damage and stain marks around the suspended \nceiling board. Also, no expert evidence was tendered,  and no proper testing and \ninvestigation was done to the area  by an expert . The Board also noted  in this case that the \nApplicant had engaged numerous contractors to carry out grouting  and waterproofing \nworks at various locations in his unit and the  immediate  result was that the leaks were \nnot arrested.  This exercise  of grouting  by the Applicant\u2019s con tractor was another trial and \nerror  approach  to eliminate any suspected potential  water seepage at the external wall  \njoint.  \n23 As stated before, the presumption under section 101(8) of the BMSMA does not apply Raman Dhir  v MCST Plan No. 1374                           STB No. 8 of 2019 ( The Balmoral ) \nPage 9 of 11 \n for lateral seepages through walls, windows and w all joints. The Board, therefore, ruled \nout that the source of water seepage was from the common property , i.e. the external wall \njoint.    \n24 The other source of seepage would be from the balcony floor  slab directly above the \nsuspended ceiling board. There w ere evidence of ponding and chokage at the balcony \nfloor area. The presumption in section 101(8) of the BMSMA would apply in this case. \nThe Board finds that the water seepage that caused the damages to the  suspended  ceiling \nboard came from the balcony floor which is a private strata area b elonging  to the \nApplicant . So even if the  suspended  ceiling board is  a common property, the Applicant \nis responsible for its damage and must bear responsibility.   \n25 The Board  dismiss ed this claim.  \nTHE $ 700 INVOICE  \n26 The Board  had ordered that \u201c any repairs to fixed window panels will be paid by the \nRespondent \u201d.  \n27 As we had stated previously, it is too late  to dispute quantum  and it is not in the interest s \nof both parties to do an e xpensive  assessment  exercise . \n28 It appears to us that the $ 700 invoice was for repairs to the windows. The Respondent \nwill therefore reimburse the Applicant th at amount on proof that the amount in the invoice \nhad been full y paid by the Applicant.  \nCOSTS  \n29 It is clear to the Board that the fundamental issue at this rehearing was for damage s to the Raman Dhir  v MCST Plan No. 1374                           STB No. 8 of 2019 ( The Balmoral ) \nPage 10 of 11 \n various parts of the Applicant\u2019s unit because  of water  seepages.  \n30 The Applicant had succeeded  in some claims and failed in others.  \n31 In exercising our discretion in awarding costs, we are aware that costs should follow the \nevent.  \n32 However, in this rehearing, we are of the view that it would be unfair to penalize  any \nparty on co sts. The Board is of the view that fairness is an important factor in the exercise \nof the discretion.  \nTHE BOARD\u2019S ORDERS  \n33 The Board orders as follows: - \n(1) The Respondent will reimburse the  Applicant the sum of $4,100 for repairs to the \nceiling  and walls  below the RC Flat Roof upon proof that the said sum had been \nfully paid by the Applicant  and it was for repairs to the ceiling and walls below the \nRC Flat Roof.  \n(2) The claims in respect of the external ceiling board and external wall joint are \ndismissed.  \n(3) The Respondent will reimburse the Applicant the sum of $700  for the window \nrepairs  upon proof that the said sum had been fully paid by the Applicant.  \n(4)  Each party to pay its own costs in this reh earing.  \n(5) The Board\u2019s decision s in respect of costs in the other hearing  and rehearing  remain \nunchanged.  \n(6) There will be no orde r on interest.  \n Raman Dhir  v MCST Plan No. 1374                           STB No. 8 of 2019 ( The Balmoral ) \nPage 11 of 11 \n  \n \nDated this 8th day of September  2021 \n \n \n \n \n           _________________________  \n           Mr. Seng Kwang Boon   \n           Deputy President  \n \n \n \n           _________________________  \n           Mr. Kong Mun Kwong   \n           Member  \n \n \n \n           _________________________  \n           Mr. Tony Tay Chye Teck   \n           Member  \n \n \n            \n \n \nMs. Carolyn Tan Beng Hui and Mr. Kevin Leong  (Tan & Au LLP ) for the \nApplicant . \n \nMr. Lim Tat and Ms. Jasmin Kang (Aequitas Law LLP ) for the Respondent . \n \n \n "

Mr Cheng Hiap Choon, Mr  Muthu Jagannath and Mr Peter Chen Keng Or  (the \u201c Applicant s\u201d) \nare the subsidiary proprietor s (\u201cSPs\u201d), in the development known as The Warren .   \n2. The Respondent  is the Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 3001 ( the \u201c MCST \u201d).  \n 1) Cheng Hiap Choon 2) Muthu Jagannath      STB No. 19 of 2021 \u2013 The Warren  \n3) Peter Chen Keng Or  vs MCST 3001  \n                                \n \n \n3 \n 3. The Applicant s applied under section 103 of the  Building Maintenance and Strata \nManagement Act  (the \u201cBMSMA\u201d ) for four (4 ) orders in connection with the annual general \nmeeting of the management corporation that was held on 30 January 2021.  The annual \ngeneral meeting was conducted via video and audio teleconference.  Under section 103 of \nthe BMSMA , resolutions passed and elections hel d at meetings of the management \ncorporation may be invalidated by the Board when the Board considers that provisions of \nthe BMSMA  in relation to meetings of the management corporation have not been complied \nwith. The Applicants are seeking the following or ders: \na Invalidate the resolution to re -nominate election candidates for the 16th Management \nCouncil of MCST 3001 ; \nb Invalidate the  election of  council members of the 16th Management Council of MCST \n3001 that were elected after being re -nominated ; \nc The Respondent to be liable, for the reimbursement of the application fees, the \nmediation fees, the hearing fees and any other legal fees related to th e order  and \nd Reinstate the si x candidates who were nominated in compliance to Section 53  \nBMSMA , as the legitimate elected council members of the 16th Management Council.  \nBACKGROUND  \n4. The Warren comprise s 699 lots. All the subsidiary proprietors only own one (1) unit each.  \n \n5.  On 30th January 2021, the 16th Annual General Meeting ( the \u201c 16th AGM \u201d) was  held. It was \nfacilitated by the Managing Agent, Exceltec Property Management Pt e Ltd, represented by \nMr Eric Tan  and chaired by Mr Aloysius Ng Joo Liang, Cha irman of the then -incumbent \n15th Management Council ( the \u201c 15th MC\u2019).  \n \n6. On 2nd January 2021, a Notice of Agenda for the 16th AGM to be held on 30 January 2021, \nfrom 1 pm to 5 pm, v ia virtual video and audio teleconference was circulated to the residents \nof The Warren. The agenda for the AGM included the following:  \n\u201c5.1 To nominate members of the 16th Management Council.  \n  5.2 To determine number of members and thereafter, elect members of the 16th \nManagement Council.\u201d  \n 1) Cheng Hiap Choon 2) Muthu Jagannath      STB No. 19 of 2021 \u2013 The Warren  \n3) Peter Chen Keng Or  vs MCST 3001  \n                                \n \n \n4 \n 7. The 16th AGM commenced at about 1 pm on 30 January 2021 over the video -conferencing \nplatform, Zoom. 106 SPs attended the AGM in person while another 185 SP s attended by \nproxy.  \n \n8. A 5-member panel consisting of Mr Aloysius Ng, Mr William Lim (Secretary of the 15th \nMC), Mr Calvin Ng (Treasurer of the 15th MC), Ms Wu Xiaowen  (lawyer in attendance from \nLexton Law Corporation) and Mr Eric Tan regulated the meeting. The panel was situated \nphysically at the office of the managing agents at IMM.  \n \n9. Prior to the AGM, a nomination form  from one (1) SP who owned one (1) lot.  listing the \nnames of nine (9) subsidiary proprietors as prospective council members  (\u201cNine (9) Written \nNominees \u201d), was sent to the MCST . \n \n10. The 1st Applicant said that it was wrong to use one (1) form to nominate nine (9) nominees \non the grounds that the booklet `Strata Living in Singapore\u2019 states that \u2018Ownership of one \nlot entitles you to nominate one person only\u2019.  \n \n11. At the 16th AGM, another six (6) candidates were nominated orally to run for elections, (\u201cSix \n(6) Or al Nominees \u201d) making a total of fifteen ( 15) nominees. After the nominations were \ndeclared closed, a disagreement led to a Motion to re -nominate candidates  (the \n\u201cRenomination Motion \u201d), with the written nomination form containing the Nine (9) \nWritten Nominees treated as \u201cnullified\u201d.   \n \n12. The general body voted in favour of the Re -nomination Motion. Thereafter, through the oral \nnomination process, ten ( 10) candidates stood for elections  including the original Nine (9) \nWritten Nominees . Of the Six (6) Oral Nominees, only one of them stood for election, the \nrest decided not to participate  in protest.  \n \n13. Every subsidiary proprietor who was eligible to vote was permitted to vote and their vote \nwas counted.  \n \n14. The top nine ( 9) candidates with the highest number of votes were elected into the 16th \nCouncil.  1) Cheng Hiap Choon 2) Muthu Jagannath      STB No. 19 of 2021 \u2013 The Warren  \n3) Peter Chen Keng Or  vs MCST 3001  \n                                \n \n \n5 \n ISSUES BEFORE THE BOARD  \n15. The issues to be determined by the Board are:  \na Whether the Re -nomination Motion should be invalidated;  \nb Whether the election of the 16th Council should be invalidated and  \nc Whether the Six (6) Oral Nominees may be reinstated as council members.  \n \nAPPLICANTS\u2019  CASE  \n \nThe Improper Nominations  \n16. The disputed series of events begin at Agenda item number 5.1, as recorded in the  Minutes \nof the 16th AGM (\"the AGM Minutes\u201d)   \n \n17. As recorded at section 5.1.2 of the AGM minutes, the Managing Agent, represented by Mr \nEric Tan, announced that there were nine ( 9) nominees who submitted their names for \nelection. Mr Danny Chen g had asked if the  nine ( 9) nominations were all proposed by the \nsame person and seconded by the same person. This was confirmed by Mr Eric Tan. A copy \nof the nomination form was not made available to the subsidiary proprietors during the \nmeeting but it wa s later obtained by the Applicants (\" the Written Nomination Form \").  \n \n18. Mr Danny Cheng then referred to a guide titled \u201cStrata Living in Singapore\", produced by \nthe Building and Construction Authority (\" the SLS Guide \"), and stated his  understanding \nthat there was a cap on the number of persons that a person could nominate .  \n \n19. At this time, Ms Wu  Xiaowen  advised that she did not have the SLS Guide, but her \nunderstanding was that there were no limits on the number of persons that a person could \nnominate. Mr Danny Cheng disagreed, and a short discussion followed whereby Mr Danny \nCheng requested to find out the legitimate way to nominate persons, and to correct it if it \nwas erroneous .  \n \n20. Mr Aloysius Ng did not agree and decided to proceed on w hat had been the practice in \nprevious years and called for oral nominations. A further six (6) persons  (the Six (6) Original \nNominees)  were nominated orally including the Applicants, and nominations were declared \nto be closed with a total of fifteen ( 15) nominees and the motion was proposed and seconde d.  1) Cheng Hiap Choon 2) Muthu Jagannath      STB No. 19 of 2021 \u2013 The Warren  \n3) Peter Chen Keng Or  vs MCST 3001  \n                                \n \n \n6 \n The Improper Re -Nomination Resolution  \n \n21. However, shortly after the nominations were declared as closed, a side conversation was \nrecorded to take place amongst the Panel, including Mr Aloysius Ng, Mr Eric Tan and Ms \nWu Xiaowen. During this side conversation, it appear ed that Mr Aloysius Ng was re questing \nMr Eric Tan to re -nominate Nine (9) Written Nominees , including himself, due to a fear that \nthe nominations would later be challenged and nullified . \n \n22. Following the side conversation, Mr Eric Tan returned and stated that \"the Council here \nactually they would also want to consented and verify that they would want on record, since \nthey are challenged on this, they will just go through the procedures that each one nominate \neach one so that it is in order \u2014proper order, so that the names of the nine persons is not by \none person. \u201d    \n \n23. Mr Eric Tan's statem ent was promptly disputed by various subsidiary proprietors including \nMr Danny Cheng, as it would effectively be reopening the nomination process. This \nstatement also came as a surprise to the App licants, as it was a complete about -turn from Mr \nAloysius Ng's earlier position that there was no error in the form .  \n \n24. It was also confirmed by Ms Wu Xiaowen that she agreed that once nominations were \ndeclared closed, the re should b e no further oral nomina tion of candidates .   \n \n25. Despite the numerous objections, Mr Aloysius Ng and Mr Eric Tan decided to proceed with \nthe re -nomination resolution, recorded at paragraph 5.1.32 of the Minutes of the  AGM:  \n \n\"It was resolved by way of ordinary resolution that:  \n\"there be a re -nomination of candidates for election as Council members. \"  \n(\"the Re -nomination Resolution \")  \n \n26. Through out the subsequent re -nomination process, many SPs continued to raise their hands \nindicating they wished to comment. However, they were not unmuted and given limited \nopportunities to speak . It is also evident from the AGM transcript that numerous subsidiary \nproprietors did not agree with the manner in wh ich the AGM was conducted.   1) Cheng Hiap Choon 2) Muthu Jagannath      STB No. 19 of 2021 \u2013 The Warren  \n3) Peter Chen Keng Or  vs MCST 3001  \n                                \n \n \n7 \n 27. The Nine (9) Written Nominees were then orally nominated to stand for elections (\u201cNine (9) \nOral Nominees). One of the Six (6) Oral Nominees decided to take part while the other five \n(5) refused.  At the conclusion of the election , the 16th MC consisted of the Nine ( 9) Oral \nNominees .  \n \nNon-compliance with First Sc hedule of BMSMA as due notice not given  \n \n28. The Applicants \u2019 case is that the resolution to re -nominate candidates for the 16th MC during \nthe 16th AGM was not in compliance with paragraph I(4)(a) of the First Schedule  of the \nBMSMA as advance notice of the motion was not given to the subsidiary proprietors. The \nrelevant paragraph I(4) reads as follows:  \n \n\"(4) No motion shall be submitted at a general meeting unless   \n(a) notice of the motion has been given in accordance with this paragraph; or  \n(b) the motion is a motion to amend a motion of  which notice has been so given, \nprovided the amendment does not change the subject matter of  the motion .\u201d  \n \n29. According to paragraph s 1(1) and 1(2)(b) of the First Schedule of the BMSMA, notice of a \nresolution must be given pursuant to a notice of general meeting. This notice must be served \nat least fourteen ( 14) days prior and include the proposed resolutions. The relevant \nparagraphs are reproduc ed below:  \n \n\"1 .\u2014(l) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Act, notice of a general meeting of \na management corporation or subsidiary management corporation shall be served on each \nsubsidiary proprietor who is a member thereof and on the first mort gagee of a lot, as \nascertained from the strata roll, at least 14 days before the meeting.  \n(2) Every notice for a general meeting shall  \n(a) specify the place, day and hour for the meeting;  \n(b) include each proposed resolution to be considered at the meeting;  \n(c) specify any other business to be transacted at the meeting;  \n\u2026\u201d  \n 1) Cheng Hiap Choon 2) Muthu Jagannath      STB No. 19 of 2021 \u2013 The Warren  \n3) Peter Chen Keng Or  vs MCST 3001  \n                                \n \n \n8 \n 30. The Applicants said i t cannot be disputed that the Re -nomination Resolution was proposed \non the day of the AGM itself, on 30 January 2021, with the first mention of it being after \nnominations for the 16th MC were announced to be closed. This is recorded in paragraph \n5.1.17 of the AGM Minutes .  \n    \n31. The Re -nomination Resolution was not included in the Agenda, when Notice of the 16th \nAGM was circulated on or around 2 January 2021 . Therefore , due notice could not have \nbeen given to the other subsidiary proprietors, especially those who may be voting by way \nof proxy votes.   \n \n32. The Applicants say t he Re -nomination Resolution therefore does not comply with the \nrequirements set out in the  First Schedule of  the BMSMA.   \n \nNon-compliance used to \u201ccure\u201d non -compliance  \n \n33. As a result of the Re -nomination Resolution being passed at the 16 th AGM, the Respondent \nwere effectively using this non -compliant resolution to cure the defective Written \nNomination Form after the declaration of closure of nominations.  \n \n34. There is a further non -compliance in the Written Nomination Form, because the names of \nthe Nine (9)  Written  Nominees were proposed by the same subsidiary proprietor at 53 # XXX  \nand seconded  by 51 # XXX .  \n \n35. This is a non -compliance with Section 53 of the BMSMA because Section 53(12) read with \n53(8)(b) of the BMSMA provides that for the purposes of determining the eligibility of a \nsubsidiary proprietor's nominee for election, an individual wou ld \"not be eligible for \nelection\", if he had been nominated by a subsidiary proprietor whose number of nominees \nexceeded the threshold number for that subsidiary proprietor, such threshold number to be \nproportionate to that subsidiary proprietor's share va lue.  \n \n36. Sections 53(8) and 53(12) of  the BMSMA are as follows:  \n 1) Cheng Hiap Choon 2) Muthu Jagannath      STB No. 19 of 2021 \u2013 The Warren  \n3) Peter Chen Keng Or  vs MCST 3001  \n                                \n \n \n9 \n \"(8) Notwithstanding subsection (6) and without prejudice to subsection (7), the following \npersons shall also not be eligible for election as a member of the council:  \n(a) an individual who is a joint subsidiary proprietor of a lot with another subsidiary \nproprietor, if  that other subsidiary proprietor is also a candidate at that election or \nhas nominated another person for that election; and  \n(b) an individual who is nominated for election by a subsid iary proprietor who owns 2 or \nmore lots, if that subsidia ry proprietor together with any of  his nominees:  \n(i) nominated at the same election; or  \n(ii) elected or appointed to the council at the same or other election,  \nor such of his nominees, exceed the threshold n umber for that subsid iary proprietor \ndetermined in accordance with subsection (12).  \n(12) For the purposes of determining the eligibility of any subsidiary proprietor's nominee \nfor election as a member of a council under subsection (8)(b), the threshold number  for that \nsubsidiary proprietor shall be  \n(a) the number of council members that is proportional to the subsidiary proprietor's \nshare value, ignoring any  fraction; or  \n(b) 49% of the number of council members determined under subsection (1),  ignoring any  \nfraction, whichever number is lower. \u201d  \n \n37. This is explained further in the SLS Guide at page 12:  \n\"Ownership of one lot entitles you to nominate one person for election. If  you own two \nor more lots, you are entitled to nominate more persons for election, in proportion \nwith you share value, but not more than 49% of the total number of  council seats .\u201d  \n \n38. The same paragraph in the SLS Guide is also included at the base of the Written  Nomination \nForm itsel f.  \n \n39. In the Warren Condominium, there are 699 total lots, and more than 2,600 shares in the \nestate. The maxi mum number of shares that a single subsidiary proprietor holds is 5 shares, \nwhich would no t entitle any single subsidiary proprietor to nominate more than 1 person. 1) Cheng Hiap Choon 2) Muthu Jagannath      STB No. 19 of 2021 \u2013 The Warren  \n3) Peter Chen Keng Or  vs MCST 3001  \n                                \n \n \n10 \n According to Section 53(8)(b), the 9 SPs nominated by the single subsidiary proprietor \nwould therefore not be eligible for election.   \n \nInclusion of proxy votes in the vote count for the R -nomination Motion breached para graph  \n17(2) of the First Schedule , BMSMA  \n \n40. The Applicants further submit that the inclusion of the proxy votes in the vote count for the \nRe-nomination Motion was not compliant with para graph  17(2) of the First Schedule of the \nBMSMA. The proxy holders who cast their proxy votes in respect of the Re -nomination \nMotion had no authority whether by contract or statute to do so, and accordingly, the proxy \nvotes should have been excluded from the vot e count.   \n \n41. Pursuant to paragraph 17(2) of the First Schedule to the BMSMA,  the SPs who attended by \nproxy had only given their proxy votes to the proxy holders for the purposes of voting for \nor against the resolutions specifically named in the Notice of AG M and the Prescribed Proxy \nForm, and nothing more.   \n \n42. Paragraph 17(2) of the First Schedule is reproduced below : \n(2)  Where it is desired to afford subsidiary proprietors an opportunity of voting for or \nagainst a resolution, the instrument appointing a prox y shall be in the following form:  \n*I/We, ......................................... of being *a member/members of the abovenamed \nmanagement corporation, appoint ......................................................................................, \nof ......................................................., as *my/our proxy to attend at the [annual or \nextraordinary, as the case may be] general meeting of the manag ement corporation or \nsubsidiary management corporation, to be held on ......... 20 ........, and at any adjournment \nof the meeting and to vote for *me/us on *my/our behalf in the following manner  \nResolution  For Against  Abstain  \n    \nNotes:  \n1. A subsidiary pro prietor may direct his or her proxy to vote on the resolution by ticking \nthe desired box (in favour of/against the resolution or abstain from voting) in the above \ntable. An abstain vote will not be counted in the calculation of votes . 1) Cheng Hiap Choon 2) Muthu Jagannath      STB No. 19 of 2021 \u2013 The Warren  \n3) Peter Chen Keng Or  vs MCST 3001  \n                                \n \n \n11 \n 2. If the subsidiary pro prietor does not indicate his or her voting preference in the above \ntable, the proxy may vote or abstain from voting at the proxy\u2019s discretion, in relation \nto any matter which is put before the meeting (including any resolution to adjourn the \nmeeting or to  amend any resolution proposed at the meeting).  \n3. This instrument appointing a proxy is void if *I am/we are present at the meeting . \nSigned on ............................. 20 ..........  \n..............................................................  \nSignature( s) of subsidiary proprietor( s) \n..............................................................  \nSignature( s) of proxy  \n*delete whichever is inapplicable  \n43. In Lim Kim Seng v MCST  P1an No 2298  STB 1 of 2020  (Changi Green)  (\u201cChangi Green \u201d), \nthe proxy form did not provide for votes on the number of persons to be elected as members \nof the management council. It was undisputed that the proxy form was defective and the \nproxy holder did not have the authority to vote on the number of members of the \nmanagement council (at  paragraphs  [9] and [19]  of Changi Green ).  \n \n44. In Si-Hoe Kok Chun & Anor v Ramesh Ramchandani  [2006] SGHC 1576, the High Court \nheld at  paragraph  [19] that the proxy holder was not pr operly authori zed to vote as proxy on \nbehalf of his wife at the AGM where the proxy form was not timeously lodged in compliance \nwith the BMSMA provisions. The High Court also remarked at [18] as follows:  \n \n\"18 At common law there is no right to appoint a proxy, this being a right conferred \nby contract: Harben v Phillips (1883) 23 Ch D 14. Accordingly, a party seeking to \nexercise such right has to observe the requirements stipulated by the contract. \nLikewise, where the right is conferred by statute, the requirements set out therein \nshould be observed.\"    \n \n45. The Applicants argue g iven that the Re -nomination Motion was not included in the Notice \nof Agenda and the Prescribed Proxy Form, the proxy holders had no auth ority \u2014 whether \nby statute or contract \u2014 to cast their proxy votes. Notwithstanding the above, proxy votes \nwere included in the vote count for the Re -nomination Motion in breach of paragraph 17(2) 1) Cheng Hiap Choon 2) Muthu Jagannath      STB No. 19 of 2021 \u2013 The Warren  \n3) Peter Chen Keng Or  vs MCST 3001  \n                                \n \n \n12 \n of the First Schedule of the BMSMA. This is clear given that the total number of votes cast \non the Re -nomination Motion was 192 (see paragraph 5.1.31 of the AGM minutes), which \nwas more than the number of SPs who attended the AGM in -person (106 ). \n \nPrejudice caused because non -compliance affected election result  \n46. The Applicants claim that i f the nominations made pursuant to the Written Nomination Form \nwere not valid, then the nine ( 9) Written Nominees should not be eligible for election.   \n \n47. Pursuant to paragraph 8(2) of the First Schedule of the BMSMA, the MCST should have \ncontinued to the next item on the Agenda, i.e. to decide on the number of members of the \ncouncil based on the remaining Six (6) Oral N ominees who had been validly nominated  by \nway of oral nomination.   \n48. As there were six (6) remaining nominees and nine ( 9) council seats, the Applicants, who \nare amongst the Remaining Six (6) Oral Nominees, would have stood a good chance of \nelection to the 16th MC. That they were not subsequently elected shows that use of the Re -\nnomination Resolution to 'cure the defect' had a significant impact on the outcome of the \nelection.   \n \n49. It should also be noted that the defect in the Written Nomination Form was pointed out and \ndiscussed prior t o the nominations being closed. The Chairman and MA already had ample \nnotice and opportunity to be able to rectify the nominations by making oral nominations \nprior to the closure of nominations, but they chose not to do so. To allow them to be \nsubsequently  re-nominated by way of a back door would cause prejudice to the other \nnominees, given that the defective nominations would have meant a disqualification of their \ncandidateship.   \n \n50. Finally, the Applicants say that there was oppression of the minority which caused grave \ninjustice to the Six (6) Oral Nominees as Mr Aloysius Ng misused his power as Chairman \nof the AGM to favour him and his fellow Nine (9) Oral Nominees and to disadvantage the  \nSix (6) Oral Nominees.   \n \nApplication to invalidate the election of the 16th MC  \n(a) There is a non -compliance with the Section 53 of  the BMSMA  1) Cheng Hiap Choon 2) Muthu Jagannath      STB No. 19 of 2021 \u2013 The Warren  \n3) Peter Chen Keng Or  vs MCST 3001  \n                                \n \n \n13 \n 51. Further and/or in the alternative, the Applicants are seeking an invalidation of the election  \nof the 16th MC on the basis of the improper nomination process.   \n \n52. The non -compliance with Section 53 of the BMSMA is as described above, where pursuant \nto Section 53(8)(b) the Nine (9) Oral Nominees should not have been eligible for the election \ndue to their improper nomination by way of the Written Nomination.   \n \n(b) There is prejudice caused by the non -compliance because the Nine ( 9) Written  Nominees \nwere eventually elected to the 16th MC even though their nomination was invalid.  \n53. The failure to comply with Section 53(8)(b) materially affected the nomination and \nsubseq uently the  election result, since the Nine ( 9) Oral Nominees were eventually \nnominated to the 16th MC, despite the flaws with their nomination.   \n54. The Applicants say p rejudice has been caused to the Applicants as the Remaining Six (6) \nOral Nominees would have been elected should the flawed Written Nomination have been \ndeclared invalid.   \n \nApplication for the  re-instatement of the Remaining Six (6) Nominees as the 16th MC \n55. In the event that there is no council or executive committee, the Board may, according to \nSection 102(a)(i) of  the BMSMA, make an order to convene a meeting for the purpose of \nelecting or appointing person(s) to fill the vacancy.   \n \n56. Following from a null ification of the invalid Re -nomination Resolution and the invalid \nWritten Nomination, the Applicant s seek for the continuation of the general meeting, where \nthe meeting proceeds to decide on the number of council members. Given that there are only \nsix ( 6) candidates, the Applicants request for these Remaining  Six (6) Nominees to be \nappointed to the Council.  \n \n57. In the alternative, the Applicants seek an order for the Board to convene a meeting for the \nelection process to be restarted since it was flawed from the nomination stage.   \n \n58. On the issue of costs, the Applicants seek $15,000.00 plus GST & disbursements in the event \nthey succeed and no order as to c osts in the event their application is dismissed.   \n 1) Cheng Hiap Choon 2) Muthu Jagannath      STB No. 19 of 2021 \u2013 The Warren  \n3) Peter Chen Keng Or  vs MCST 3001  \n                                \n \n \n14 \n RESPONDENT\u2019S CASE  \n \n59. The Respondent say that t hroughout the AGM, as seen from the draft minutes of meeting as \nwell as the transcript of the recording of the virtual meeting, the Respondent did not waiver \nfrom its position that the Nine (9) Written Nominees were validly nominated \nnotwithstanding rigoro us challenge and objections from the Applicants and other subsidiary \nproprietor.   \n \n60. When the 1st Applicant raised his objection to the Nine (9) Written Nominees, he was in \neffect raising a \u201c point of order \u201d: \n \n\u201cA \u201cpoint of order\u201d is raised when, in the opinion of a member, the rules or \nregulations governing a meeting are being broken, or when a member has a genuine \ndoubt as to the correctness of the procedure being followed. This might include any \nnon-observance of standing orders, any defect in the procedure of the meeting e.g. the \nabsence of a quorum, the use of offensive language, the fact that the motion under \ndiscussion is not within the scope of the notice,. Or any other informality or \nirregularity. Contradiction of and requests for explanation from the person speaking \nin the debate are not points of order \u2026  \n \nThe person raising a point of order should do so by putting a briefly worded question \nto the chair stating that they wish to speak on a point of order\u2026The chair\u2019s ruling on \nthe point of orde r is final, but others present should be given an opportunity of \nspeaking upon it if they so desire\u2026\u201d  \n \n(From Shackleton on \u201cThe Law an d Practice of Meetings \u201d)  \n \n61. To this point of order, the chair accepted the view of the Respondent\u2019s lawyer and decided \nthat the procedure was not wrong and that the meeting would proceed with the elections.   \n \n62. When the managing agent's suggestion that the Nine (9) Written Nominees nominate each \nother was objected to, the chairman wanted to  proceed with the election based on the existing \n15 nominations as evident from the transcript of the ACM:  1) Cheng Hiap Choon 2) Muthu Jagannath      STB No. 19 of 2021 \u2013 The Warren  \n3) Peter Chen Keng Or  vs MCST 3001  \n                                \n \n \n15 \n  \n\u201cMS WU XIAO WEN: . I think the panel 's position now is that the issues can be taken \nup after the AGM ... and to continue with the voting on the agenda now.  \n ALOYSIUS NG\u2022. Okay gentlem en, we have decided to commence with the next \u2014 the \nvoting procedure... \u201d  \n \n63. The meeting could not proceed however, because of objections raised by, inter alia, the 1st \nApplicant, who insisted that the Nine ( 9) Written Nominees have to be disqualified. The \nRespondent, who was advised that the Nine (9) Written Nominees were correctl y nominated, \ndid not agree to disqualify them. Several attempts to close the discussion and progress to the \nelection were opposed. There was an impasse: the objectors did not want the election to \nproceed and did not agree to re -nominate the candidates. The  BMSMA and Regulations do \nnot provide for what to do in this situation.  \n \n64. Eventually, to move on, a vote was put to the floor to decide whether or not to carry out the \nnomination again. It was put to the floor in this manner:  \n \n\"We need a voting process to let the floor decide whether to proceed or not to proceed. \nIf the answer is wrong, it is \"No ' then we will proceed according to the first one ... \"  \n \nIn other words, if the floor decides not to proceed with the re -nomination, then the meeting \nwill proceed with the original fifteen ( 15) nominees. The general body voted \noverwhelmingly in favour of re -opening the nomination and carrying out the nomination \nprocess again.   \n \n65. The Respondent contends that under common law, the meeting has the power to make such \ndecisions. It was acknowledged by the Court of Appeal in the case of Chan  Sze Yin g v \nMana gement  Corporation Strata Title Plan No 2948 (Lee Chuen T\u2019nq, intervener)  [2021] \n1 SLR 841 at [39] that:  \n \n\u201cAnnual general meetings of a management corporation are governed by statute as \nwell: see section  27 of the Act and the First Schedule to the Act. At the same time, \nhowever, there is a body of  common law that applies where the express rules 1) Cheng Hiap Choon 2) Muthu Jagannath      STB No. 19 of 2021 \u2013 The Warren  \n3) Peter Chen Keng Or  vs MCST 3001  \n                                \n \n \n16 \n governing a meeting are silent. The residual  power discussed in this case is part of \nthat body of common law, which is of general application and may apply to various \ntypes of  meetings not  just meetings of  a management corporation.\u201d  \n \n66. The Applicants had objected to this motion on the grounds that no notice had been provided \nfor it, but in the case of Meow Terk Meng Edward  v MCST 2572  [2010] SGSTB 7, where \na similar objection was raised, the Board observed that it is \"not unusual for mot ions to arise \nspontaneously at business meetings. In this case, it arose at the adjourned meeting because \nof matters uncovered since the meeting was adjourned ...\". In that case, the dispute had been \nover a motion to remove the applicant as a member of cou ncil and disqualify him after the \nelection on the grounds that his proxy forms were irregular. The applicant applied to \ninvalidate the resolution as this motion had not been on the agenda contrary to the provisions \nof the BMSMA. The vote for the applicant' s removal had been overwhelmingly in favour of \nhis removal. Therefore, the Board did not invalidate  the resolution as it was of the view that \ncompliance with the BMSMA would not have affected the removal and disqualification of \nthe applicant.  \n \n67. The Responde nt say that a lternatively, the \"Re -Nomination Motion\" may be considered a \nprocedural motion because it does not propose a substantive question or point but the manner \nin which the meeting is conducted. Procedural motions, by its nature, are usually not set  out \nin an agenda of any meeting. Procedural motions propose a change to how the meeting is \nbeing run or what is happening in the meeting. An example of a procedural motion is a \nmotion to amend an existing motion.   \n \n68. In the alternative, the Respondent contends that the \"Re -Nomination Motion\" was a means \nfor the chairman to ascertain the wishes of the majority on a procedural issue so as to proceed \naccordingly. The majority of those present at a club or corporate meetin g have an absolute \nright to regulate the procedure and/or conduct of that meeting. As observed by Lord Russell \nof Killowen in the House of Lords case of Carruth v Imperial Chemical Industries Ltd  \n[1937] 2 AC 707 at 761 (which was cited in the case of Petri e Christopher Harrisson v \nJones Alan  [2005] 2 SLR(R) 387] by the Honorable  Justice VK Rajah at [43]):  \n 1) Cheng Hiap Choon 2) Muthu Jagannath      STB No. 19 of 2021 \u2013 The Warren  \n3) Peter Chen Keng Or  vs MCST 3001  \n                                \n \n \n17 \n \"There are many matters relating to the conduct of  a meeting which lie entirely in the \nhands of those persons who are present and constitute the meeting . Thus, it rests with \nthe meeting to decide whether notices, resolutions, minutes, accounts and such -like \nshall be read to the meeting or be taken as read; whether representatives of the Press \nor any other persons not qualified to be summoned to the  meeting shall be permitted \nto remain; whether and when discussions shall be terminated and a vote taken; \nwhether the meeting shall be adjourned. In all these matters, and they are only \ninstances, the meeting decides, and, if necessary , a vote must be take n to ascertain the \nwishes of the majority .\"  \n \n69. The concept that the wishes of the majority determine the outcome of a meeting is \nrecogni zed in section 103 of the BMSMA where it is provided that the Board shall not make \nan order invalidating any resolution or election if compliance with the provisions of the \nBMSMA would not have resulted in a failure to pass the resolution or have affected the \nresult of the election.  \n \n70. In the case of Cheang Wai Yew v MCST 975 [2009] STB 1,  the application sought an order \nto invalidate council elections because of non -compliance with the BMSMA and \nirregularities in the procedure. The facts of the case were that the applicant, who was the \nchairman of the previous council walked out of the mee ting because it was alleged out of \ncontrol. The Board did not invalidate the election because the evidence showed that even if \nthe applicant and those who walked out of the meeting had stayed on and voted against the \ncurrent members of the management counc il, the votes they had would not have been \nsufficient to prevent the current members of the  management council from being elected. \nFurther, there was no prejudice because the applicant said that he was not interested in \nseeking re -election into the new cou ncil.  \n \n71. In Lim Lay Hoon & Ors v Thomas Tan Lay Siong  [2009 ] STB 3, the applicants had walked \nout of the meeting before a resolution was passed therefore, even though there was non -  \ncompliance with the BMSMA in that the voting of council member was by poll rather than \nby lot, because the council members were  unanimously elected by those who remained and \nvoted, the outcome of the result would have been the same even if the voting had been \ncorrectly done by lot.   1) Cheng Hiap Choon 2) Muthu Jagannath      STB No. 19 of 2021 \u2013 The Warren  \n3) Peter Chen Keng Or  vs MCST 3001  \n                                \n \n \n18 \n  \n72. An objection raised by the Applicants is  that the proxy form could not have been used again \nfor the re -nomination because no notice of the Re -Nomination Motion was given to \nsubsidiary proprietors. To this, the Respondent contends that : \n \na First, the nomination of candidates is not a motion and n ot something voted on. No \nproxy votes were used. From the minutes of meeting, the attendance list and the \ntranscript, it can be seen that the candidates were nominated by subsidiary proprietors \nin person who had actually attended the 16th ACM:  \n  Candidates  Proposer  Subsidiary Proprietor  \n1 Ng Joo Liang \nAloysius  53 #XXX  Srinivas Malathkar: in \nperson  \n2 Lee Chee Cheng, \nWilliam  51 # XXX  Ng Joo Liang: in person  \n3 Leong Kong Kit \nRichard  53 # XXX  Lim Chee Cheng: in person  \n4 Lau Chang Siong  53 # XXX  Chan You Meng: in person  \n5 Umashankar  51 # XXX  Shen Ye: in person  \n6 Wu Cheng Joo  37# XXX  Richard Leong: in person  \n7 AnantPoddar  57 # XXX  Chew Guan Sing: in person  \n8 Muthu Jagannath  39 # XXX  Kiran Arun Kekre: in person  \n9 Chan You Meng  45 # XXX  Woo Cheng Joo: in person  \n10 Shen Ye, Simon  51 # XXX  Wang Swee Chuang: in \nperson  \n \nb Secondly, as for the issue of an alleged lack of notice of the 'Re -Nomination Motion' \nto subsidiary proprietors who had given proxies, it should be pointed out that where \nthe nomination of candidates are concerned, the proxy form gives absolute discretion \nto the proxy holder to make or support nominations. Unlike for other motions, the \nform does not enable the subsidiary proprietor to specify \"For, \"Against' or \n\"Abstain\". It merely states \"Votes to be case by the proxy' (See page 17 of the AEIC \nof Danny Cheng).  1) Cheng Hiap Choon 2) Muthu Jagannath      STB No. 19 of 2021 \u2013 The Warren  \n3) Peter Chen Keng Or  vs MCST 3001  \n                                \n \n \n19 \n c This must mean that the subsidiary proprietors accept that although they did not know \nprior to the meeting who would be nominated as a candidate, they we re prepared to \naccept the candidates their proxies supported. That being so, the fact that the Re -\nNomination Motion was not on the agenda would not have affected these subsidiary \nproprietors' decisions in any way.   \n \n73. For these reasons, the Respondent submit s that the proxy holders could vote on the Re -\nNomination Motion.   \nAlleged Prejudice to the Applicants  \n74. The Respondent  emphasi zed that the Six (6) Oral Nominees were free to participate in the \nnomination process when it happened the second time. Their rights to stand for election had \nnot been infringed upon. Neither had their rights to vote for the nominees been affected.   \n \n75. The 1st Applicant\u2019s  evidence of how the Six (6) Oral Nominees were prejudiced is as \nfollows : \n `it's a prejudice to the six (6) of us who have actually participated the first nomination in a \nproper way. And if the nine ( 9) nominees in the invalid  form were disqualified, then the six \n(6) of us were correctly nominated orally during the nomination pro cess would be the only \nsix (6) eligible  for the election.\u2019  (emphasis added)   \n \n76. When the 2nd Applicant was asked why the other Five (5) Oral Nominees did not want to \nparticipate in the election anymore, he said:  \n \n\"Well, they chose not to because they felt the election was not being conducted  properly.... \nnone of  them wanted to stand  for election after what had transpired.\u201d   \n \n77. In reality , nothing had changed with the re -nomination. The Six (6) Oral Nominees \noriginally had to stand for elections with the Nine (9)  Written Nominees. After the 'Re -\nNomination Resolution \u2019 the Nine ( 9) Written Nominees were still nominated to run for \nelections. Any prejudice felt by the oral nominees was self-imposed. Their rights had not \nbeen impinged.   \n 1) Cheng Hiap Choon 2) Muthu Jagannath      STB No. 19 of 2021 \u2013 The Warren  \n3) Peter Chen Keng Or  vs MCST 3001  \n                                \n \n \n20 \n 78. The Applicants expected the Six (6) Oral Nominees to have a walkover but this would not \nhave happened  because even if the Re -Nomination  Motion had failed to pass, as emphasi zed \nabove, the election would h ave proceeded on the fifteen ( 15) nominees. This was conceded \nby the 1st Applicant : \n \n\u201cQ: ...I put it to you that notwithstanding your objections, it would not have been a \nsituation where the 9 written nominees would be disqualified and only 6 oral nominees \nwould stand  for elections. They would have proceeded on the 15 ...nominees ...Do you \nagree or do you disagree?  \nA: Your Honour, I agree because I have no control of the  AGM, I am not in control of  \nthe AGM .\u201d  \n \n79. By choosing not to participate in the election, the Applicants cannot say that they were \nprejudiced in that the oral nominees would have won the elections. Instead, it is submitted \nthat because the oral nominees were offered the equal opportunity to stand for elections \ntoget her with the written nominees, they had suffered no prejudice from the Re -Nomination \nResolution or the elections.   \n \n80. It is for the Applicants to show how any person had been prejudicially affected by the Re -\nNomination Resolution or how the election results would have been affected. This, the \nApplicants have failed to show. This point is underscored in the case of Sinqara m \nKoqilambal & Ors v MCST 2032  [2020] SGSTB 12 where the names of nine ( 9) nominees \nwere inadvertently omitted from the meeting. Instead, another eleven ( 11) nominees were  \nelected into council. The Board did not invalidate the election. It was held at [24 ] that:  \n \n\" ...the submission that nominees who could have been elected but did not have any \nchance of being elected because the meeting did not consider and vote on their \nnominations had suffered a prejudice is not out of order. It was, however, not the ca se \nthat the prejudice was caused by the respondents.  Even though the respondent was \nnot responsible for the failure to announce the names of the earlier nominees, the \nBoard considered if the results of the elections have been affected if their names had \nbeen announced. The applicant has not put forward any e vidence whatsoever that it \nwould have been, and in all likelihood there would not have been any change in the 1) Cheng Hiap Choon 2) Muthu Jagannath      STB No. 19 of 2021 \u2013 The Warren  \n3) Peter Chen Keng Or  vs MCST 3001  \n                                \n \n \n21 \n result of the elections  had the meeting voted on the eleven on Ms Chan Tian Siang's \nlist and the earlier nominees \".  \n \n81. The Respondent contend that  the Applicants have not shown that the Respondent had caused \nthem prejudice.   \nOral Nominations after Re -Nomination Resolution  \n82. The Board had raised the question of whether it was possible for the Nine ( 9) Written \nNominees to have been orally nominated at the meeting given that they had already been \nnominated in writing. The Respondent say that Section 53B of the BMSMA provides that  \nnominations for election of council members may be in writing or oral and be accompanied \nby the consent of the candidate, which consent may be withdrawn before the election at the \ngeneral meeting.  \n \n83. Section 53B of the BMSMA was introduced by amendments to the BMSMA in 2018. The \nsecond Minister for National Development Mr Desmond Lee explained why these \namendments were introduced to the BSMSA  [RBOA Tab P pg 2/32] : \n \n\u201c\u2026[section 53B] require[s] SPs to give explicit consent before they can be nominated \nand elect ed into an MCST council. While this may seem so obvious as to not \nnecessitate express legislation, we had received feedback that some SPs had been \nelected into office without their knowledge! So the feedback that we received was very \nuseful in helping us t o craft this Bill\".   \n \n84. Incidentally, during the second reading of the Building Maintenance and Strata Management \n(Amendment) Bill, a question was raised by the MP for Fengshan Miss Cheryl Chan Wei \nLing : \n \n\"Second, consent of  nominees  for election of  council members. I certainly support this \nchange and  feel this should have been the default arrangement when BMSM4 was first \nintroduced. Council members are residents of the development and any service they \nprovide to the estate is considered voluntary. It is unfair  to have anyone nominated \nand elected without their knowledge or not of  their own  free will. The real challenge  1) Cheng Hiap Choon 2) Muthu Jagannath      STB No. 19 of 2021 \u2013 The Warren  \n3) Peter Chen Keng Or  vs MCST 3001  \n                                \n \n \n22 \n for many developments is, however, a lack of willing individuals  who want to step  \nforward and serve, given the responsibilities and thankless chores with in the estate . I \nwould like to know what plans BCA has moving forward if more condo developments \nencounter the issue of having few or no council members to form a functional MCST ?\u201d  \n \n85. Hence, a concern was raised that there could be situations where there are insufficient \nsubsidiary proprietors who are willing to become council members. Thus, it could not have \nbeen the intention of Parliament to impose hurdles on those who willingly consent to serve \non the Council (for example, by denying those who we re nominated in writing from being \norally nominated again). The policy must be that any subsidiary proprietor who wants to \nserve on a council should be given the opportunity to stand for election.   \n \n86. It is also in the interests of the management corporation  to have as many nominees as \npossible. In Guide for Meetin gs and Or ganisations  by NE Renton, at para graph  11.8, the \nauthor states:  \n \n\u201cThe making of  nominations is the starting point o  fa process which gives the members \nat large an opportunity to make a choice on whom they wish to hold office. It is \ntherefore appropriate to give them as wide a choice as possible . Two or more \nnominations made by the same person are therefore quite in orde r. There is also \nnothing technically to preve nt members from nominating themselves .\u201d  \n  \n87. Because the policy is to give subsidiary proprietors as wide a choice as possible, and because \nthere are no express provisions prohibiting this, the Respondent submits that there is nothing \nimproper in allowing nominees who had been nominated in writing to be also nominated \norally at the general meeting.   \n \nUse of Proxy Votes  \n88. The Applicants allege that the request not to use proxy votes for the Re -Nomin ation Motion \nwas ignored; however, such a request goes against paragraph 17 of the First Schedule of the \nBMSMA which permits the appointment and use of proxies to vote at general meetings. The 1) Cheng Hiap Choon 2) Muthu Jagannath      STB No. 19 of 2021 \u2013 The Warren  \n3) Peter Chen Keng Or  vs MCST 3001  \n                                \n \n \n23 \n only condition is that an appointed proxy can only represent a maximum of 2% of the total \nnumber of lots in the development.   \n \n89. The Respondent say that i n the case at hand, none of the proxies appointed represented more \nthan 2% of the total number of lots in the development. There was no basis for the \nApplicants' reque st and the Chairman had not acted unfairly or incorrectly in refusing to \naccept their request.  It is submitted that there is no reason to invalidate the Re -Nomination \nMotion.   \n \nOutcome of Election Unaffected  \n \n90. Even if, which is denied, there was non-compliance with any provision of the BMSMA, \nthe Respondent contends that compliance with the provisions of the BMSMA would not \nhave affected the result of the election.   \n \n91. The Nine (9) Oral Nominees had suf ficient proxy votes to ensure a comfortable win  into \nCouncil. The candidate with the highest number of votes was 195 and the 9th candidate \nreceived 163 votes. In contrast, the 2nd Applicant received 73 votes. When asked how \nmany votes the 1st Applicant was confident of getting, he said:   \n \n\"...based on my own estimation, I can confidently say that I will get more than my 13 \nvotes\".   \n \n92. In other words, the Applicants cannot show that they have sufficient votes to upset the \nelection results. Further, because five ( 5) of the Six (6) Oral Nominees declined to \nparticipate in the election because of incorrectly perceived breaches of the BMSMA, they \ncould not be elected and therefore the outcome would not be any different.   \n \n93. The Respondent contend that t hese nominees who changed their mind abou t standing for \nelection cannot claim to be prejudiced as they had, of their own volition, declined to be \nnominated.   \nReinstatement  of the Six (6) O ral Nominees  1) Cheng Hiap Choon 2) Muthu Jagannath      STB No. 19 of 2021 \u2013 The Warren  \n3) Peter Chen Keng Or  vs MCST 3001  \n                                \n \n \n24 \n 94. The Six (6) Oral Nominees are now asking for an order to be \"reinstated\" as Council \nmembers. In the Applicants' Opening Statement, the Applicants clarified that what they are \nseeking, should the Re -Nomination Resolution be invalidated, is for the \"continuation of the \ngeneral meeting where the meeting proceeds to decide on the number of co uncil members, \nand given that there are only six (6) candidates, the Applicants request for these Remaining \n6 Nominees to be appointed to the Board . \"  \n \n95. The Respondent say t he Strata Titles Board does not have the jurisdiction to appoint council \nmembers. Section 53(4) of the BMSMA states that all council members have to be elected \nat the A GM. Further, as explained earlier, even if the Re -Nomination Resolution is \ninvalidated, there would not be only 6 candidates left, contrary to the imagination of  the \nApplicants.   \n \n96. For these reasons, the Respondent contends that the Applicant s\u2019 prayer for 'reinstatement' \nmust be dismissed.   \n \n97. On the issue of costs, the Respondent submit that costs of $20,000 all in with the \ntranscription costs to be borne by the losing party is a reasonable order.   \n \nBOARD \u2019S FINDINGS  \n \n98. The Applicant s are asking the Board to make the orders under Sect ion 103 of the \nBMSMA. Sect ion 103 provides as follows:  \n\u201cOrder to invalidate proceedings \u201d \n103-(1) Where, pursuant to an application by a subsidiary proprietor or first mortgagee of \na lot, a Board considers that the provisions of this Act have not been complied with in \nrelation to a meeting of the management corporation or subsidiary management \ncorporation, or a council or e xecutive committee, the Board may, by order   - \n(a) invalidate any resolution of, or election held by, the persons present at the \nmeeting; or  \n(b) refuse to invalidate any such resolution or election  \n(2) A Board shall not make an order under subsection  (1) refusing to invalidate a \nresolution or election unless it considers   1) Cheng Hiap Choon 2) Muthu Jagannath      STB No. 19 of 2021 \u2013 The Warren  \n3) Peter Chen Keng Or  vs MCST 3001  \n                                \n \n \n25 \n (a) that the failure to comply with the provisions of this Act did not prejudicially \naffect any person; and  \n(b) that compliance with the provisions of this Act would not ha ve resulted in a \nfailure to pass the resolution, or have affected the result of the election, as the case \nmay be .\u201d \n \n99. This Board agrees  with the position taken in Singaram Kogilambal and Ors v MCST Plan \nNo. 2032  STB22 of 2020  (Pine Grove)  where it held : \n\u201c19. It is clear that a Board has been given discretion to invalidate or not to invalidate when \nthe provisions of the Act in connection with meeting have not been complied with. It is only \nwhen the two (2) conditions in section 103(2) are present that the Board will not have a \ndiscretion and must make an order to invalidate viz failure to comply has prejudicially affected \nanother and compliance would have resulted in a failure to pass the reso lution or affect the \nelection  \n20. In Si-Hoe Koh Chan v Ramesh Ramchandani [2006] 2 SLR(R) 592 , Andrew Ang J held \nat [27] that where \u201c the failure to comply with the provisions of the Act would not have \nresulted in a failure to pass the resolution [or affect the elections], the Board is not bound \nto invalidate the resolution\u2019.  \n21. Invalidating when no one has been prejudiced or when non -compliance would not have \naffected  the outcome would require the management corporation to go through a second \nprocess where time and money (in convening another meeting) will be expended \nunnecessarily.  \u201c \n  \nRe-Nomination  \n \n100. The Board is to consider if the Re -Nomination Motion was valid . \n \n\u201cNomination of candidates for election as member \u201d \n \n53B.\u2014(1)  A nomination of a person for election to be a member of the council of a \nmanagement corporation or the executive committee of a subsidiary management \ncorporation, is of no effect if subsections (2), (3) and (4) are not complied with for that \nnomination.  1) Cheng Hiap Choon 2) Muthu Jagannath      STB No. 19 of 2021 \u2013 The Warren  \n3) Peter Chen Keng Or  vs MCST 3001  \n                                \n \n \n26 \n  \n(2) Only a subsidiary proprietor, or a person entitled to vote at a general meeting of \na management corporation or subsidiary management cor poration, may nominate a \nperson for election as a member of the council of the management corporation or the \nexecutive committee of the subsidiary management corporation, as the case may be.  \n \n(3)  A nomination for election to be a member of the council of a management \ncorporation or the executive committee of a subsidiary management corporation \u2014 \n(a) may be oral or in writing;  \n(b) must \u2014 \n(i) if oral, be made at the general meeting of the management corporation or \nsubsidiary management corporation  for the purposes of the election; or  \n(ii) if in writing, be given at least 48 hours before the start of the meeting at which the \nelection is to be held to the secretary of the management corporation or subsidiary \nmanagement corporation, or to the convenor  of the meeting in the case of the first \nannual general meeting; and  \n(c) must state \u2014 \n(i) the name of the person nominated (called in this Act the candidate); and  \n(ii) the name of the person making the nomination (who may or may not be the \ncandidate).  \n \n(4)  A nomination, whether oral or made in writing, made for the purposes of an \nelection at a general meeting of a management corporation or subsidiary management \ncorporation, is effective only if it is accompanied by the consent of the candidate \u2014 \n(a) given in writing at least 48 hours before the start of the meeting at which the \nelection is to be held to the secretary of the management corporation or subsidiary \nmanagement corporation, or to the convenor of the meeting in the case of the first \nannual general meeting; or  \n(b) given orally at the meeting  \n \n101. Having considered the evidence, the Board accepts that there were strong and divergent \nviews on whether the AGM should proceed with the election based on the written \nnomination form with  the N ine ( 9) Written N ominees together with the Six (6) Oral 1) Cheng Hiap Choon 2) Muthu Jagannath      STB No. 19 of 2021 \u2013 The Warren  \n3) Peter Chen Keng Or  vs MCST 3001  \n                                \n \n \n27 \n Nominees or to go for re -nomination , which took more than 2 hours of the AGM. The Chair \ndescribed it as an \u201cimp asse\u201d. (Transcript Pg 224, lines 21 to 24).  The Board would agree \nwith such characterization of t he situation at the time. T he Chair in such a situation should \nalways decide in the best interest s of the general body . In the present case  he decided to let \nthe general body vote on the issue of re -nomination.   \n \n102. We note that the Chairman had said that he would like to \u201cnullify\u201d the earlier (written) \nnomination and proceed with the voting on whether the re -nomination should take place \n(transcript of AGM pg 94, line 14 -17 AW1). The general meeting then voted in favour of \ndoing so and the effect of th at was that nomination of all candidates were done orally with \neach of them nominated by a different SP (transcript of AGM, pg 44 item 5.1.31 and 47 item \n5.1.55 AW1). The Board notes that while the A pplicant s take objection to the process and \ndecision to r e-nominate, there are no objections as to the actual oral nomination process that \ntook place after the re -nomination decision.  \n \n103. The Applicants take the view that the re -nomination Motion should be invalidated because:  \n \na It breached para graph  8(2) of First Schedule of BMSMA which says that after \nnominations have closed, the management corporation must decide on the number of \ncouncil members;  \nb No 14 day s\u2019 notice was given for the said motion in breach of para graph  1(4)(a) of the \nFirst Schedule B MSMA; and  \nc Inclusion of proxy votes in the vote count for the said motion breached para graph  17(2) \nof the First Schedule BMSMA . \n \n104. On paragraph [10 3(a)], the Board agrees with the R espondent  that the provision does not \nrequire that the decision on the number of council members shall take place immediately  \nafter the closing of nominations. It obliges the general body to decide on the same and they \nin fact did so after the re -nomination.    \n \n105. On paragraph [10 3(b)], the Board is of the view that if the re -nomination process involved \noral candidacy, then the issue is whether  Section 53B of the BMSMA required the 14 day s\u2019 \nnotice for such candidacy, and the answer would clearly be no. Candidates may be 1) Cheng Hiap Choon 2) Muthu Jagannath      STB No. 19 of 2021 \u2013 The Warren  \n3) Peter Chen Keng Or  vs MCST 3001  \n                                \n \n \n28 \n nominated in writing or orally. The Board notes the Six (6) Oral Nominees were, as their \ndescription suggests, orally nominated as candidates at the AGM itself where no advance \nnotice was provided . It is also clear on the facts that the Nine (9) Written Nominees agreed \nto withdraw their written candidacy before the start of the election when they subsequently \nconsented  to be orally nominated after the Re -nomination motion. The Board makes a \nfinding of fact that, regardless of the validity or othe rwise of the Written Nomination Form, \nit was clearly considered withdrawn or superseded in view of the above.  \n \n106. Nothing has been shown to the Board that candidates who were previously nominated in \nwriting, and which written nomination has been withdrawn, ca nnot then be nominated orally \nat the AGM itself. The Board had expressly sought counsels\u2019 views on the issue at the end \nof trial as part of their submissions. The Board is of the view that this is the correct \ninterpretation of  Section 53B. Adopting the A pplicants\u2019 position would be ascribing too \nnarrow and restrictive a view to an important part of the general meeting; the nomination \nand election of council members . If so, what is important is whether there has been \ncompliance with the provisions for oral nominations per Section 53B BMSMA, which did \nnot require any advance notice. The Board is therefore of the view that the oral nomination \nprocess for  the Nine (9) Ora l Nominees  which was eventually voted on was valid.    \n \n107. In any event, even if the Board w as wrong on the issue, the Board would be inclined to \naccept the view of the R espondent  in that the re -nomination  motion was a means by the \nChairman to ascertain the w ishes of the general body on a procedural issue so as to be able \nto proceed accordingly per the views  of the Honorable  Justice VK Rajah  in the case of Petrie \nChristopher Harrisson v Jones Alan  [2005] 2 SLR(R) 387  (Para graph  68 in this GD). In \nthe view of the Board, this would be consistent with the Board\u2019s duty to consider both limbs \nof Section 103(2) before deciding on whether to exercise its discretion to invalidate a \nresolution or election. Further, the Board is minded to  agree that the re -nomination motion   \nwas akin to that of a procedural motion as the issue of nomination of candidates and their \nelection had been clearly provided for in the agenda of the AGM , with no restriction on the  \nform of the nomination being done orally or in writing. In this regard, the Board finds \nsupport from the Applicants submissions that their  objections to the re -nomination motion \nis more procedural than substantive . In Paragraph  38 of Applicants opening st atement , they \nsay, \u201c The Chairman & MA already had ample notice and opportunity to rectify the 1) Cheng Hiap Choon 2) Muthu Jagannath      STB No. 19 of 2021 \u2013 The Warren  \n3) Peter Chen Keng Or  vs MCST 3001  \n                                \n \n \n29 \n nominations by making oral nominations prior to the close of nominations, but they chose \nnot to do so.\u201d  \n \n108. On paragraph [106(c)] , at first glance, the A pplicants\u2019 submission on this point deserves \nsome consideration, which is that the voting in favour of carrying out the re -nomination \nprocess included the use of proxy votes, which would not be within the scope or authority \ngiven to the proxy holder as the  re-nomination motion was not on the agenda of the AGM. \nFurther, the proxy form being a form of contract between the proxy and proxy holder, did \nnot include such a  term within its terms. On this issue, and following from the Board\u2019s \nfindings above that th e re-nomination was akin to that of a procedural motion, as the issue \nof nomination of candidates and their election had been clearly provided for in the agenda \nof the AGM, we find that this falls squarely within the scope of s/no. 5.1 and 5.2 of the proxy  \nform . \n \n \n1) Cheng Hiap Choon 2) Muthu Jagannath      STB No. 19 of 2021 \u2013 The Warren  \n3) Peter Chen Keng Or  vs MCST 3001  \n                                \n \n \n30 \n  \n109. Even if the Board were to accept the A pplicant s\u2019 position, the Board would still have come \nto the same conclusion in substance. This is because the real issue as the Board has pointed \nout is whether the Nine (9) Oral Nominees were validly nominated pursuant to Section 53B \nBMSMA, for which the Board has decided in the affirmative. That be ing so, even if the re -\nnomination vote is impugned because of the use of proxy votes, this did not have the effect \nof negating the subs equent oral nominations as each of the nine ( 9) nominees were validly \nnominated by separate SPs who were present at the AGM.  \n \nPrejudice/oppression of minority   \n \n110. The Applicants sought to distinguish the authority in Re Pasir Panjang (Strata Titles Plan \nNo. 983 [1991] SGSTB 5 (\u201c Pasir Panjang Road \u201d) where although the notice period of the \nExtraordinary General Meeting did not comply with the BMSMA provisions, the Boa rd then \nheld it was not prepared to invalidate the resolutions passed at the EGM pursuant to Section \n103 of the BMSMA for, inter alia , the following reasons:  \n \na The failure to comply with the BMSMA provisions did not prejudicially affect the \napplicant as t he loss of his office as secretary was a voluntary position (he could not \nvote as he was in arrears of his maintenance contribution);  \n \nb Compliance with the BMSMA provisions would not have resulted in a failure to pass \nthe resolutions or affected the resul t of any election since the applicant was in the \nminority of 1 out of 7 SPs and his vote would not have made a difference; and  \n \nc In the absence of fraud or oppression of the minority the Board was not prepared to \nupset the decisions of the meetings the MC ST.  \n \n111. The Applicants submit that the facts of their case are distinguished from Pasir Panjang Road \nin that not only was there prejudice occasioned by the non -compliance with the BMSMA \nprovisions and/or the results of the Re -nomination Motion may have turned out differently \nhad there been compliance with the BMSMA provisions, there is also oppression of the 1) Cheng Hiap Choon 2) Muthu Jagannath      STB No. 19 of 2021 \u2013 The Warren  \n3) Peter Chen Keng Or  vs MCST 3001  \n                                \n \n \n31 \n minority and these reasons, collectively, behooves this Board to remedy the injustice by \ninvalidating the Re -nomination M otion.  \n \n112. With respect to the Applicants\u2019 allegation of oppression of the minority , this Board  agrees \nwith the Respondent that the Applicants have also not discharged their burden in showing \nthat there was such oppression or fraud on a minority.  The Board a grees that  an SP may \nvote as he pleases and in his own interest (see Pender v Lushington  (1877) 6 CHD 75). It \ncannot be the case that there is fraud on a minority just because candidates who obtained \nproxies had voted in support of themselves or each other . \n \n113. Under common law, minority shareholders of a company may bring derivative action on \nbehalf of the company when they are able to show that the majority had shareholders who \nhad used their control of the company to stifle an action against wrongdoing (see  Sinwa SS \n(HK) Co Ltd v Morten Innhaug  [2010] 4 SLR 1). The minority shareholders have to show \nthat the company had reasonable, or legitimate, case against the defendant for which the \ncompany might recover damages or obtain other relief; that the majority had used their \ncontrolling power to prevent an action being brought against them by the company; and that \nthe majority must have been obtained benefit at the company\u2019s expense or some loss or \ndetriment must have been caused to the company.   \n \n114. The Board agrees with the Respondents and finds  that the above criteria have not been met \nin the present case.  As per the Respondent\u2019s submissions, t his action is not brought by the \nApplicants on behalf of the Respondent for a wrong suffered by the Respondent and the \ncandidates who obtained the highest number of votes were the ones elected into the council.  \nThe Applicants were not prevented from bring ing any action against the Respondent and \nthere was no loss or detriment to the Respondent.   \n \n115. The Board finds that above -stated holding in Pasir Panjang Road  applies equally to the \npresent case . \n \n116. The Board finds as to the Applicant s\u2019 allegations that the Chairman had tried to control who \ncould speak at the meeting and dominate the meeting,  the transcript of the AGM  is \ninstructive.   The transcript for the AGM captured much of the dissenting comments which 1) Cheng Hiap Choon 2) Muthu Jagannath      STB No. 19 of 2021 \u2013 The Warren  \n3) Peter Chen Keng Or  vs MCST 3001  \n                                \n \n \n32 \n showed that others were given a n opportunity to speak.  The Board notes  the Chairman\u2019s \nobservations  that the disagreement over the nomination of candidates for election took more \nthan two (2) hours of the AGM\u2019s time.  \n \n117. At paragraph 95(g) of the Applicants\u2019 Closing Submissions, the Applica nts stated that \n\u201cMany SPs\u2026commented that it was unfair that only members of the nine ( 9) Written \nNominees\u2019 bloc had been selectively unmuted to speak and orally re -nominate themselves .\u201d  \nThe Board agrees with the Respondent that these SPs\u2019 comments must be  viewed in their \nproper context as after the Re -Nomination Motion was passed, the Respondent called for \nnominations again. Naturally, the Nine (9) Written Nominees wanted to be re -nominated as \nthey had earlier already indicated their interest to be nominated in the written nomination \nform.  They were thus unmuted to nominate each other which was the intention of the Re -\nNomination Motion from the start, but even they had to take turns to nominate each other \nand thereafter the  Six (6) Oral Nominees wer e also given the opportunity to be nominated.  \n \n118. The Board  noted  that five (5) of the Six (6) Oral Nominees decided not to participate in the \nelections after the re -nomination was allowed. This they did on their own free will, having \ndecided, rightly or wron gly, that they will protest the decision. They were not prevented \nfrom taking part , as the participation of the 2nd Applicant, who was one of the Six (6) Oral \nNominees, showed. The prejudice alleged, if any, was caused by their own deci sion not to \nparticipate in the election. On the facts, the Board is of the view that the real motivation of \nthe five in not taking part in the election is the realization that they will not win once their \nhope for victory through the disqualification of the Ni ne (9) Written Nominees was dashed \nas a result of the re -nomination process. Their prediction came true as can be seen from the \noutcome of the 2nd Applicant\u2019s participation (see paragraph 12 4 infra).  The Applicants were \nhoping to win the council elections by a walkover on a technicality, or in sporting parlance, \nby way of a technical knock -out of their opponents. On the facts, the Board is of the view \nthat this is not the kind of prejudice envisaged by Section 103(1) and (2) BMSMA.  \n \nInvalidation of Council Elections  \n \n119. The Applicants second ground is to invalidate the council members of the 16th Management \nCouncil of MCST 3001 that were elected after being re -nominated; largely on the same 1) Cheng Hiap Choon 2) Muthu Jagannath      STB No. 19 of 2021 \u2013 The Warren  \n3) Peter Chen Keng Or  vs MCST 3001  \n                                \n \n \n33 \n grounds as the first issue due to breaches of the various BMSMA provisions and therefore \ncaused prejudice to the Six (6) Oral Nominees.  \n \nUse of proxy votes for  election   \n \n120. The elections of the council then went ahead after the close of nominations with ten ( 10) \ncandidates; the Nine ( 9) Oral Nominees who were originally nominated in The Written \nNomination Form and one from the  six (6) original oral candidates. The other five ( 5) \noriginal oral candidates decided not to take part in the election as they felt the election was \nnot conducted properly (NE pg 74, lines 4 -5, 17 -18). The election that was carried out \nincluded using the proxy vo tes. Whether or not the proxy votes could be properly used would \ndepend of the terms thereof  (per Si-Hoe Kok Chun & Anor v Ramesh Ramchandani  [2006] \nSGHC 1576 ). The proxy form used gave the proxy holder wide discretion, including voting \nfor any of the 3 options; for, against or abstain. Further, i n the notes of the said form, under \n`Notes\u2019:  \n \n\u201cA subsidiary proprietor may direct the proxy to vote on the resolution by  ticking the desired \nbox (for/against/abstain from voting) in the above table. An abstain vote will not be counted \nin the calculation of votes.  \nIf the subsidiary proprietor does not indicate his or her voting preference in the above table, \nthe proxy may v ote or abstain from voting at the proxy\u2019s discretion, in relation to any matter \nwhich is put before the meeting (including any resolution to adjourn the meeting or to amend \nany resolution proposed at the meeting). \u201d (emphasis the Board\u2019s)  \n \n121. This was a form where the second  paragraph of the  Notes applied  as the subsidiary proprietor \ndid not indicate his or her voting preference to the proxy . As such , the proxy \u201c may vote or \nabstain from voting at the proxy\u2019s discretion, in relation to any matter which is put before the \nmeeting (including any resolution to adjourn the meeting or to amend any resolution proposed \nat the meeting \u201d. The election of the candidates fell squarely within the scope of item 5. 2 of the \nproxy form  read with the second paragraph of the N otes. The Board finds that the proxy forms \nwere used validly for the election as th ey came within the scope of the authority given to the \nproxy.   \n 1) Cheng Hiap Choon 2) Muthu Jagannath      STB No. 19 of 2021 \u2013 The Warren  \n3) Peter Chen Keng Or  vs MCST 3001  \n                                \n \n \n34 \n 122. As provided for in Section 103(2), the Board in refusing to invalidate a resolution or election \ncan only come to that conclusion if it considers  \u2014 \n(a) that the failure to comply with the provisions of this Act did not prejudicially \naffect any person; and  \n(b) that compliance with the provisions of this Act would not have resulted in a \nfailure to pass the  resolution, or have affected the result of the election, as the case \nmay be.  \n \n \n123. The Board notes that Council nominations and elections are an exercise in democracy in \nstrata -titled properties, where the will of the majority prevails  with limited exceptions , e.g. \nfraud or oppression.  Section 103(1) and (2) BMSMA read together clearly informs the Board \nthat failure to comply with the provisions of the Act is not sufficient to invalidate a \nresolution. There must also be prejudice caused  and which affected the result of the election. \nWhere there are attempts to impugn election outcomes based on allegations of non -\ncompliance of the provisions of the BMSMA this Board has consistently looked beyond the \nalleged breaches and at the substance o f the election process to determine if any real \nprejudice was caused and which would have affected the result of the election .(e.g. Re Pasir \nPanjang  (Strata Titles Plan No. 983 [1991] SGSTB 5  (\u201cPasir Panjang Road\u2019) , Sin qaram  \nKoqilambal & Ors  v MCST 2032 [2020 ] SGSTB 12 , Cheang Wai Yew  v MCST 975 [2009] \nSTB 1 , Lim Lay Hoon  & Ors v Thomas Tan Lay Siong [2009] STB 3 , Meow Terk Meng  \nEdward v MCST 2572 [2010] SGSTB 7,  and others ) \n \n124. Presently, the lowest successful candidate of the Nine (9) Oral No minees received 163 votes. \nThe 2nd Applicant, who was the only one of the Six (6) Oral Nominees who took part in the \nelection, received 73 votes, which was less than half that of the lowest successful Oral \nNominee. The A pplicant s have not put up any evidence that they would have received more \nvotes than any of the Nine (9) Oral Nominees short of knocking -out the proxy votes and/or \ndisqualifying the Nine (9) Oral Nominees for alleged breaches of the BMSMA.  \n \n \n \n \n 1) Cheng Hiap Choon 2) Muthu Jagannath      STB No. 19 of 2021 \u2013 The Warren  \n3) Peter Chen Keng Or  vs MCST 3001  \n                                \n \n \n35 \n Reinstatement of Six ( 6) Oral Nominees as Elected Council Members  \n \n125. The final claim of the A pplicants  is to reinstate the six candidates (6 Oral Nominees) as the \nlegitimate elected council members of the 16th Management Council of MCST 3001. Strictly \nspeaking, based on the findings of the Board above that the nominations and election will \nnot be impugned, this claim is already disposed of. In any event, the Board agrees with the \nRespondent  that since the Six (6) Oral Nominees were never elected in the first place, the \nissue of reinstatement does not even arise, aside from whether or not the Board has the power \nto do so.  \n \n126. In their Closing Submissions the A pplicants  made a claim that in the event there is no council \nor executive committee, the Board may make an order to convene a meeting for the purpose \nof electing or appointing persons to fill the vacancy under Section 102(a)(i) BMSMA. The \nApplicants  also seek, give n that they say the Re -nomination Motion and Written Nomination \nForm were invalid, the continuation of the 16th AGM, and given that the six ( 6) Oral \nNominees were the only candidates, they request that the six (6) of them be elected into the \n16th MC. Alter natively, they seek an order from the Board to convene a meeting for the \nelection process to be restarted since it was flawed from the nomination stage.  \n \n127. Aside from making these claims, the A pplicant s do not provide any basis nor authority for \nany of these  orders  sought  nor even if the Board has the jurisdiction and/or power to make \nthem or if it is appropriate to do so; e .g. the power to \u201ccontinue\u201d an AGM and/or to grant a \n\u201crequest for the Six ( 6) Oral Nominees to be elected into the 16th MC\u201d. The Board similarly \ndismisses the last claim and the derivatives arising therefrom.  \n \nPreliminary Issue as to whether the Written Nomination Form Breached  Section 53(8)(b) read \nwith Section 53(12) BMSMA such that the 9 Written Nominees\u2019 written nomination was invalid  \n \n128. The Applicants stated the above as a preliminary issue as it was not part of their claims \nbefore the Board. It was therefore not necessary on the part of the Board to make any \nfindings on it, as in any event, the Board found on the facts that the said form was withdrawn \nand/or was not relied on in the eventual nomination and election that took place. For \ncompleteness the Board sets out in brief the parties\u2019 positions on the matter.  1) Cheng Hiap Choon 2) Muthu Jagannath      STB No. 19 of 2021 \u2013 The Warren  \n3) Peter Chen Keng Or  vs MCST 3001  \n                                \n \n \n36 \n 129. The Applicants\u2019 position is that ownership of one lot entitles  the subsidiary proprietor to \nnominate one person for election, while the Respondent\u2019s position is that there is no such \nrestriction on subsidiary proprietor s who own one lot. Both parties are in agreement that the \nBMSMA is clear that subsidiary proprietor s with 2 or more lots may nominate more \nnominees in proportion to their share value subject to a cap of 49% of the number of council \nmembers, whichever is lower. Their disagreement is how the provisions of the BMSMA \nshould be interpreted in the case of how  many nominees a single subsidiary proprietor may \nput up. In particular, the A pplicant s quoted from the BCA\u2019s Strata Living in Singapore, A \nGeneral Guide (at pg 26 AW1), which states: \u201cOwnership of one lot entitles you to nominate \none person for election\u201d.  \n \n130. The Applicants\u2019 position can be found in para graphs  36 \u2013 58 A pplicants Closing Submissions  \nwhile the Respondent\u2019s position can be found in para graph s 15 \u2013 37 R espondent\u2019s Closing \nSubmissions.  The Board notes that the said Strata Living Guide is what it s ays it is, a guide \nonly; while it may seek to provide assistance to the public as to the dos and don\u2019ts of strata \nliving in Singapore, it does not have legal effect like the provisions of the BMSMA or its \nsubsidiary legislations. The contents of the guide must still be derived from and have statutory \nbasis.  \n \n131. The Board agrees with parties that there should be more clarity in the BMSMA as to whether \nownership of one lot entitles the subsidiary proprietor to nominate one nominee or more for \nelections into coun cil. While the Board sees merit in the Respondent\u2019s arguments that the plain \nwords of the BMSMA does not disallow a subsidiary proprietor who owns one lot from \nnominating more than one nominee, the Board also appreciates the position of the Applicants \nthat the true purport of the relevant sections cannot be that such subsidiary proprietors can \nnominate any number of nominees for election when those who own more lots are subject to \na cap. This may well be why BCA\u2019s Strata Living Guide is worded in the way it  is, rightly or \nwrongly. The Board does not have to decide on this issue to determine the outcome of this \ncase, but it may well be fruitful for this to be clarified at the appropriate juncture and/or for \nthe relevant provisions of the BMSMA to be made clea r.   \n132. Lastly, the Board wishes to thank counsel for both parties for the ir submissions and \nassistance to the Board in coming to this decision, which the Board has found to be very \nhelpful . 1) Cheng Hiap Choon 2) Muthu Jagannath      STB No. 19 of 2021 \u2013 The Warren  \n3) Peter Chen Keng Or  vs MCST 3001  \n                                \n \n \n37 \n BOARD\u2019S DECISION  \n \n133.

Monica Neo  (Member)     \nBackground  \n1. The 1st Applicant is a resident of Block 33 , Unit #XXX , Singapore 768064 (the \n\u201cUnit \u201d) in the development known as Skies Miltonia ( \u201cDevelopment \u201d). The \nUnit is owned by the 2nd Applicant.  The Unit is one of the penthouse units in the \nDevelopment  with their own private habitable roof terraces.  The cons truction \nwas completed and the Temporary Occupant Permit (TOP) for the Development \nwas obtained sometime in 2016.  \n2. The Respondent is the management corporation of the Development.  Lim Kee Liew @ Victor Lim and anor    STB No. 54 of 2020  (Skies Miltonia)  \nv MCST Plan No. 4407  \n3 \n 3. On 16 August 2018, the Respondent received an email from the Senior  Planner , \nDevelopment Control Group of the Urban Redevelopment Authority (\u201c URA \u201d), \nMs Lau Ching Yu, that:  \n(a) URA ha d received feedback that the Subsidiary Proprietor of the Applicants\u2019 \nunit ha d enclosed the private roof terrace;  \n(b) The private roof terrace s of Skies Milt onia were  designed and approved as \nsemi -outdoor spaces . Therefore ,  they should  not be enclosed;  \n(c) While URA did allow screening to be installed at roof terraces to provide \nprivacy and sun shading, the screening had to  comply with certain \nperformance criteri a.  Glass panels, windows, sliding doors would  not meet \nthe criteria and were therefore  not permitted for the private roof terrace s; and  \n(d) The Respondent  could  follow up with the appropriate actions under the \nBuilding Maintenance & Strata Management Act (\u201c BMSMA \u201d) to ensure that \ntheir private roof terrace comp lied with the screening requirements.  \n4. Four  (4) subsidiary proprietors of Skies Miltonia filed an application with the \nStrata Title Board s (\u201cSTB \u201d) in STB 75 of 2019 (\u201c STB 75/2019 \u201d) against the 1st \nand 2nd Applicants seeking the following orders:  \n(a) That the 1st and 2nd Applicants carry out and complete, at their own costs, \nsuch works or alterations to the Applicants\u2019 Unit to dismantle the \nunauthorized works within a reasonable time as determined by th e Board \nconstituted in STB 75/2019 ; and  \n(b) That the 1st and 2nd Applicants pay the costs of the application.  \n5. The 1st and 2nd Applicants resisted the application under STB 75/2019 by raising, \ninter alia , allegations of defects in the Lightning Protection System (\u201c LPS\u201d).  \nThey made references to a report dated February 2019 by Er . Dr. Lock Kai Sang \nof PQR Consultants (\u201c Dr Lock\u2019s Report \u201d) prepared for the Respondent during \nthe 1st Applicant\u2019s chairmanship  of the management council of the Development . Lim Kee Liew @ Victor Lim and anor    STB No. 54 of 2020  (Skies Miltonia)  \nv MCST Plan No. 4407  \n4 \n 6. Dr. Lock in his rep ort of February 2019 raised certain  instances of  \nnonunitcompliance with SS555:2010 , a Code of Practice for protection against \nlightning . The Building and Construction Authority (\u201c BCA \u201d) had  assessed Dr . \nLock's report and agreed on four ( 4) instances where the LPS was non -compliant \nto Part s 1, 3 and 4 of SS555:2010. All other issues in the report were  deemed \ncompliant to the Code.  \n7. At the 1st mediation of STB 75/2019  on 8 October 2019, the 1st Applicant gave \nand executed an undertaking that he would remove the un authorized works as \nsoon as the rectification of the LPS was carried out and that he would do all he  \ncould to expedite the rectification of the LPS.  On the basis of the undertaking, \nthe four (4) subsidiary proprietors withdrew their application under STB 75/2019 \non 25 November 2019.  \n8. The 1st and 2nd Applicants took out the present application under STB  54 of 2020 .  \nThe gist of their case is that:  \n(a) The acceptance by the Respondent of the rectification works by the \ndeveloper ( i.e. TG Master Pte Ltd) and the Builder ( i.e. Lian Beng \nConstruction (1988) Pte Ltd) pertaining to the LPS of the private habitable \nroof terraces of all the penthouse units and common rooftops of  Skies \nMiltonia was improper and invalid;  \n(b) The said rectification works were inadequate in ens uring that the LPS of the \nprivate habitable roof terraces of all penthouse units complied with the LPS \nCode of Practice SS555:2010, BCA\u2019s advisory notices and with the Building \nControl Act and Regulations.  \n9. It is the Applicants\u2019 case that they had constantly raised serious issues \nconcerning defects to the LPS at the Development. Sometime in January 2018 , \nthe issues with the LPS were brought up with the developer and also with BCA. \nRectifications were made to the LPS by the developer , who engaged a \nprofessional engineer , Er. Lee Wee Hing  (\u201cEr. Lee\u201d), who eventually certified \nthat the LPS installed on the Development complied with the LPS SS555:2 010 Lim Kee Liew @ Victor Lim and anor    STB No. 54 of 2020  (Skies Miltonia)  \nv MCST Plan No. 4407  \n5 \n Code of Practice. Another professional engineer , Er. Nyap Fat Ming  (\u201cEr. \nNyap \u201d), also similarly certifie d that the LPS installed on the Development \ncomplied with BCA\u2019s requirement s. \n10. BCA accepted the certifications by the two professional engineers and wrote to \nthe 1st Applicant on 7 June 2018 that \u201c the LPS of Skies Miltonia is deemed to \nhave complied with th e prevailing Code \u201d and also wrote to the developer on 19 \nJune 2018 that \u201c the LPS in Skies Miltonia complies with the design \nrequirements\u2026. We consider the lightning protection system installed in your \ndevelopment compl iant with the requirements in the Code \u201d. \n11. Notwithstanding the two professional engineers \u2019 certification s and BCA \u2019s \nacceptance, the Applicants \u2019 expert , Er. Pam Chee How (\u201cEr. Pam \u201d), gave \nevidence that there were still existing concerns regarding the adequacy of the \nLPS installed by the developer. The Applicants allege d that notwithstanding the \ncertification s by the Respondents\u2019 two professional engineers and the acceptance \nof certification s by BCA , there still exist s safety risk at the roof top during \nlighting strikes and hence there was  a building defect.  \nOrders Sought by the Applicants  \n12. The Applicants seek the following Orders from the Board : \n(a) Pursuant to section 101 of the  BMSMA   \ni. An order that the acceptance by the Respondent of minor and \ninadequate  rectification works proposed by the De veloper (T G Master \nPte Ltd)/the  Builder (Lian Beng Construction [1988] Pte Ltd) to be \ncarried out and  which were carried out by the Developer and/or Builder \non the seriously  defective  Lightning Protection Systems (\"LPS\") of the \nprivate habitable  roof terra ces of all the Penthouse Units and common \nrooftops of at  [sic] Skies  Miltonia was improper and invalid.  Lim Kee Liew @ Victor Lim and anor    STB No. 54 of 2020  (Skies Miltonia)  \nv MCST Plan No. 4407  \n6 \n ii. An order that the above rectification works proposed and carried out  \nwere inadequate in ensuring that the LPS of the private habitable roof  \nterraces of all Penthouse Units complied with the LPS Code of \nPractices  SS555:2010 (\"Code\"), complied with BCA's advisory notices \nand complied with the Building Control Act s and Regulation 2003 5th  \nSchedule Section L37 and L38 on the safety objective and performance  \nof a proper LPS (\"Building Control Act s & Regulations\"). As such the  \nsaid acceptance of the rectifications works and LPS re -certification be  \nset aside. The said penthouses are at Block 21, 23,25,27,29, 31, 33 and  \n35. \niii. An order that the Responden t engages a contractor registered with the  \nBuilding and Construction Authority (\"BCA\") to carry out rectification  \nworks on the LPS of all the Penthouse Units to rectify the deficiencies  \nand in accordance with the recommendations set out in the reports of \nDr Lock Kai Sang dated 18 February 2019 and E r Pam Chee How \ndated 30  August 2020.  \niv. In the alternative, an order that the Respondent engages a third party  \nindependent Qualified Person (\"QP\") to be agreed upon between the  \nRespondent, the Applicants and the maj ority of the individual penthouse  \nowners, to prepare a report on and prescribe the rectification works to \nbe carried out on the LPS of all the Penthouse Units, and that the  \nRespondent engages a contractor registered with BCA to carry out the  \nabovementioned  rectification works according to what is recommended  \nby the abovementioned QP' s report.  \nv. An order that the Respondent ensures that the LPS of all penthouses at  \nSkies Miltonia be rectified such that they comply with the LPS  \nSS555:2010 or SS555:2018 Code of  Practices, BCA's LPS advisory  \nnotices the Building Control Act s and Regulations and remain free from  \nall safety risks.  Lim Kee Liew @ Victor Lim and anor    STB No. 54 of 2020  (Skies Miltonia)  \nv MCST Plan No. 4407  \n7 \n vi. An order that after the rectification works are carried out, the same  \nperson who prepared the report (i.e., Dr Lock Kai Sang/Er Pam or t he \nthird party QP) review the rectification works and all the LPS of all  \nPenthouse units and re -certify the LPS of all the Penthouse Units.  \nvii. An order that the abovementioned rectification works be carried out \nand completed within 3 to 6 months from the date  of the order.  \nviii. An order that the Applicants' roof be retained, i.e., the undertaking of  \nSTB 75 of 2019 be set aside until the LPS is properly rectified and  \nrecertified  as abovementioned.  \nix. An order that should the rectification works still not be adequate as per  \nthe review of Dr Lock/Er Pam/the QP, the same person shall review the  \nLPS of all Penthouse again and prescribe further rectification works to  \nbe done and the Respondent shall engage a BCA registered contractor \nto carry out the said further rectification works prescribed.  \n(b) Pursuant to section 117(1) of the BMSMA, an order that : \u201cthe Respondent pay \nall the costs in connection with this Application, including but not limited to \nthe costs of the engagement of the proper third -party independent QP /LPS \nConsultant and Building Surveyor (if any) by agreement to provide the \nabovementioned report, the cost of the rectification works to be carried out \nand the costs of the review the rectification and re -certification of the LPS, \nwhich must be capable of complying to the Code of Practices of SS555:2010/ \nSS555:2018, BCA's LPS safety advisory circulars or notices, and the proper \nobjective and performance of LPS required under the Building Control Act \nand Regulations 2003 5th Schedule L37 & 38. The order for cost should \ninclude the costs incurred by the Applicants in discovering the deficiencies \nand non -compliance of the unsafe LPS including but not limited to the costs \nincurred by the Applicants in obtaining expert reports on the said deficiencies \nand non -compliances,  the cost of engaging the third -party QP and/or Dr \nLock/Er Pam to review the LPS again  any rectification and re -certification \nshould the Respondent continue to fail to rectify the LPS. \u201d Lim Kee Liew @ Victor Lim and anor    STB No. 54 of 2020  (Skies Miltonia)  \nv MCST Plan No. 4407  \n8 \n 13. After the conclusion of the  arbitration hearing, the Applican ts, in their \nApplicants\u2019 Written  Submissions dated 5 April 2021, informed the Board that it \nwould not be proceeding  with the Order under paragraph 12(a) (ii) above.  \nIssues before the Board  \n14. The three  main issues before the Board are:  \n(a) Whether the LPS SS555: 2010 Code of Practice (\u201c2010 Code \u201d) or the \nSS555:2018 Code of Practice (\u201c2018 Code \u201d) applied  to the rectification \nwork s to the LPS  in the Development;  \n(b) Whether the LPS of all penthouse units were defective and in breach of \nthe applicable Cod e of Practice;  and \n(c) Irrespective of the Code of Practice, whether the LPS was nevertheless \nunsafe and gave rise to safety risks to the user s of the private habitable \nroof terraces of all the penthouse units. \nThe Applicant s\u2019 Case  \n15. The Applicants \u2019 case wa s essentially for rectification works to be carried out on \nthe LPS of all the eight (8) tall buildings with penthouse units at the Development  \nand for the Applicants to keep their roof structure till such time the LPS of all  \nthe eight (8) tall buildings ar e properly rectified and re -certified  - i.e. that the \nLPS was free from all safety risks,  and complie d with the Building Control Act, \nBuilding Control Regulations and relevant Codes of Practice, namely the 2018  \nCode or alternatively the 2010  Code . \n16. It is th e Applicants\u2019 case that the LPS of all penthouse units in the Development \nwas seriously defective and not compliant with the Codes of Practice, which the \nApplicant s had been raising concerns about since January 2018. The Applicants \nallege d that there was a lack of tall lightning rods providing overhead protection, Lim Kee Liew @ Victor Lim and anor    STB No. 54 of 2020  (Skies Miltonia)  \nv MCST Plan No. 4407  \n9 \n that the lightning conductor tape  was placed on top of the parapet walls within \nreach of occupants stan ding on the upper roof terraces , and that the lightning \nconductor tape  was painted over (which reduced its conductivity ).1 \n17. The First Applicant , Lim Kee Liew , maintained in his evidence that the LPS in \nthe Development was unsafe and did not comply with th e 2010 Code ,  the 2018 \nCode and the Building Control Regulations.  As an example, he cited an incident \nwhen his son -in-law decided to go to the upper roof terrace to make some phone \ncalls.  Suddenly , there was a lightning strike at a distance and he was \nimmobilized for a few seconds, as his feet got attracted to the upper roof terrace \nground .  He  could not move and was badly traumatised.  \nThe Applicants engaged Er. Dr. Lock Kai Sang to give assessment of the LPS at \nthe Development.  Although Dr. Lock\u2019s repor t was attached to the First \nApplicant\u2019s affidavit of evidence -in-chief, he was not called as a witness.  The \nApplicants called Er. Pam  to give evidence.  Er. Pam prepared an assessment of \nthe lightning risk at the Development and commented on the report m ade by Dr. \nLock which he generally agreed with.  \nIt is not disputed that the BCA issued a directive on 31 December 2010 covering \nthe design, installation and maintenance of  the LPS.  On 31 October 2018, BCA \nissued a new standard for protection against light ning.  \n18. The Applicants further allege that the initial rectification of the LPS conducted \nby the Respondent was invalidly certified. Around December 2019 to March \n2020, minor rectification works were conducted to fix the defects to the LPS, \nand to ensure tha t the LPS complied with the Code of Practice and the applicable \nregulations. How ever, these rectifications were, so the Applicants alleged, \ninade quate as the LPS still remained allegedly defective, unsafe and not in \ncompliance with the Code of Practice and  regulations.2 The Applicants argue d \n \n1 Applicant s\u2019 Submissions da ted 5 April 2021 at paragraph 5 . \n2 Applicant s\u2019 Submissions da ted 5 April 2021 at paragraph 15 . Lim Kee Liew @ Victor Lim and anor    STB No. 54 of 2020  (Skies Miltonia)  \nv MCST Plan No. 4407  \n10 \n that the professional engineers  who signed the certification s of the \nabovementioned rectification works were not independent, and that no weight \nought to be given to the certification s of the rectification works.3 \n19. It is the Applicants\u2019 case that the Respondent, the developer, the two professional \nengineers  (i.e. Er. Lee and Er. Nyap)  (hereinafter collectively referred to as the \n\u201cPEs\u201d), and BCA have all showed complete disregard for the safety of the \nresidents and instead seem ed to be more interested in saving time and money, \ntaking short cuts and attempting to simpl y adhere to their own wrong \ninterpretation of the Codes of Practice . \n The Respondent\u2019s Case  \n20. It is the Respondent\u2019s case that the applicable Code of Practice was the 2010 \nCode, that the LPS compl ied with the 2010 Code  and that BCA had also accepted \nthe certifications and applications made by the Respondent\u2019s expert witnesses \nunder the 2010 Code .4 The Respondent\u2019s case is that the 2018  Code did not apply \nto the Development at all.   \n21. The Respondent also accepted the method of rectification proposed by the \ndeveloper  as it was duly endorsed by the independent professional engineer s and \nhad been reviewed by BCA.5 The same rectification works had been certified by \nthe independent professional engineer s, and reviewed  and accepted  by BCA. \nFurther, BCA ha d not raised any issues relating to rectifications works or that \nthe LPS was defective and did not comply with the 2010 Code.  \n22. It is the Respondent\u2019s case that the present  application wa s frivolous, vexatious, \nmisconceived and lacking in substance.6 \n \n3 Applicant s\u2019 Submissions da ted 5 April 2021 at paragraph 47 . \n4 Respondent\u2019s Submissions dated 5 April 2021 at paragraph 7.  \n5 Respondent\u2019s Submissions dated 5 A pril 2021 at paragraph 11 . \n6 Respondent\u2019s Submissions dated 5 April 2021 at paragraph 12 .  Lim Kee Liew @ Victor Lim and anor    STB No. 54 of 2020  (Skies Miltonia)  \nv MCST Plan No. 4407  \n11 \n The Board\u2019s Findings  \n23. The Board finds that the code of practice applicable to the Development was the \n2010 Code, and not the  new 2018 Code.  The 2010 Code does not cover open \nterraces  whereas  the 2018 Code , an enhanced version , covers open roof terraces.  \nIt is indisputable  that the 2018 Code did not supersede the 2010 Code, and that, \nbased on a circular dated 31 October 2018 from BCA, the new 2018 Code would \napply only to developments whose  building plans we re submitted on or after 1 \nMay 201 9. In our present case, it is not in dispute that the building plans for the \nDevelopment were submitted before 1 May 2019 . Therefore, the previous 2010 \nCode would remain applicable to the Development and not the new 2018 C ode. \nThis is notwithstanding that the rectification works to the LPS of the \nDevelopment were carried out after the new 2018 Code came into existence.  \n24. The Board also accepts the evidence of Er. Lee, a professional e ngineer  who \nwas independently engaged by  the developer of the Development, who had \nverified and certified that the rectification works to the LPS, and the LPS itself, \ncomplied with the 2010 Code.  \n25. The Board does not accept the evidence of the Applicants\u2019 expert, Er. Pam. There \nis no reason for Er. Pam to adopt the more stringent requirement of 20 metres \nrolling spare radius in his analysis when the 2010 Code only required a more \nlenient standard of 45 metres. While Er. Pam had clarified in cross -examination \nthat the higher level standard w as rec ommended for buildings with higher risks \nof flammability  such as storage of explosive or flammable contents, the Board \ndoes not accept Er . Pam\u2019s classification of the Development as one such \nbuilding. The Development was a mere residential building, and no t one for use \nas storage of flammable or explosive items.  \n26. The Board also finds no reason to doubt the appropriateness of the rectification \nworks to the LPS as well as the safety of the LPS when the independent PE s had \nendorsed and BCA had not raised any is sue with the same. Both PE s had, in their \nevidence -in-chief , stood by the ir certificat ions that were submitted to  BCA. \nIndeed, as accepted and conceded by Er . Pam in cross -examination, BCA is the Lim Kee Liew @ Victor Lim and anor    STB No. 54 of 2020  (Skies Miltonia)  \nv MCST Plan No. 4407  \n12 \n authority and has the final say  whether to accept the certi fication s. BCA \u2019s \nacceptance of the certification s is a decision that is best left to that competent \nauthority.  \n27. The Board also finds that BCA had advised that the residents were to seek shelter \nduring a thunderstorm or inclement weather and not to remain in  open spaces  - \neven with a LPS in place . If the A pplicants w ish to have more safety features, \nthey could add such features after  apply ing to the general body  to do so  (where \nnecessary) . \nThe Board\u2019s Decision   \n28. The Board dismisses all prayers in relation to matters concerning the LPS. The \ninitial defects to the LPS on the upper roof terrace s of the penthouse units had \nbeen rectified by the Respondent, certified by independent professional \nengineers who stood by t heir decision s, and were considered and accepted by \nBCA. The Applicants\u2019 submission that the Respondent, the professional \nengineers and BCA acted in disregard of the safety of residents so as to save time \nand money are attacks on their integrity  and/or pro fessionalism  and without any \nbasis whatsoever.  \n29. The Board also dismiss es the prayer that the Applicants be allowed to retain the \nroof, i.e. that the undertaking given by the Applicants in STB 75 /2019 is to be \nset aside until the LPS is properly rectified a nd recertified. It is not for this Board \nto set aside  an undertaking made before  a prior Board as  this Board  does not \nhave such powers to do so. The Applicants , having given an undertaking which \nled to the withdrawal of STB 75 / 2019 , should properly abide by their said \nundertaking , which is binding . \n30. On the issue of costs and disbursements, the Board agrees with the Respondent\u2019s \nsubmissions as fair in the circumst ances and so ordered costs of S$7,000.00  \npayable by t he Applicants to the Respondent inclusive of STB and transcription \nfees.

Respondent(s)  \n \n9 & 10 February  2021  \n \n13 April  2021  \n \nCoram:                            Mr. Oommen Mat hew   (Deputy President)  \n Mr. Frankie Chia  Soo Hien             (Member)  \n  Mr. Shahrom Bin Moham ed Ariff               (Member)  \n \nBACKGROUND  \n \n1 The Applicant  is the sole subsidiary proprietor of  a unit 10 Farrer Road # XXX  Waterfall \nGardens, Singapore 268822  (\u201cthe Unit\u201d). The Unit has 4 bedrooms in total which \ncomprise of the master bedroom (wh ich the Applicant and his partner used) and 3 other \nbedrooms.  The Respondent is the management corporation of the development known as \nWaterfall Gardens  (\u201cthe Respondent \u201d). It was common ground that the Applicant lived \nin the  Unit with his partner, Victoria, his daughter Niamh  Ethna MacFadden (\u201cNiamh\u201d)  \nand her fianc\u00e9, Rob, and his son, Fiachra  Ross MacFadden (\u201cFiachra\u201d) . Fiac hra only \nstarted living there from  24 March 2020 after his return from the United States of America  \n(\u201cUSA\u201d) . Niamh and Rob used  Bedroom 3 while Bedroom 2 which was adjacent to the \nmaster bedroom was meant for Fiachra\u2019s usage.  \n Declan Pearse MacFadden v The Management          STB No. 56 of 20 20 (Waterfall Gardens)  \nCorporation Strata Title Plan No. 3602  \n3 \n 2 The Applicant was absent at the hearing  on both 9 and 10 February 2021  (and the earlier \nmediation sessions) , according to his counsel , as a result of the Co vid-19 situation which \nkept him out of Singapore.  Prior to the commencement of the hearing , his counsel  also \nsought leave to adduce two ( 2) audio  recordings1 and three ( 3) video recordings2 as \nfurther evidence for the hearing.  At the hearing, only Niamh from the M acFadden family \ngave oral evidence.   On 10 February 2021, at the start of the hearing, the Board was \ninformed that Fiachra\u2019s AEIC was to be disregarded.  \n \n3 For the Respondent,  Sanjay Ravikumar, the Condominium Manager, L oggie Bruce \nJamieson  (\u201cLoggie\u201d) , the expert appointed by the Respondent, and Chin Tao Ren, Edison \n(\u201cEdison\u201d) (the loss adjustor from Toplis & Harding  (S) Pte Ltd (\u201cToplis\u201d) who had filed \na joint affidavit with Victor Fong Whye Poy gave evidence while the A EIC of Abdullah \nbin Mohamad, the Condominium supervisor, was disregarded.  It was also accepted that \nonly Edison was required for the purposes of the oral hearing as one of the two loss \nadjustors who came for the assessment.  \n \nPRELIMINARY ISSUES  \n \n4 Parties were asked to deal with t wo preliminary issues . Firstly , they were queried as to \nwhat the status was if the Applicant himself did not appear or give evidence at the hearing.  \nSecondly and connected to this, they were queried as to the effect of Regu lation 18 of the \nBuilding Maintenance and Strata Management (Strata Titles Boards) Regulations 2005 \n(\u201cBMSMR 2005 \u201d). \n \n5 Regulation 15 of the BMSMR 2005 states as follows : - \n \n\u201cAbsence of persons before Board  \n15.  If, at the time appointed for the arbitration hearing of a dispute or matter, the \napplicant or any other party to the dispute or matter does not appear, a Board may, \nif it is satisfied that the applicant or such other party who does not appear has been \nduly notified of the arbitration hear ing in accordance with regulation  14, proceed \nwith the arbitration hearing and make such order as the Board thinks fit. \u201d \n \nThe Board was of the view that the hearing could proceed given that the Applicant had \nlegal representation from the outset and accordi ng to the Applicant\u2019s counsel, Niamh had \nthe requisite Letter of Authority from the Applicant in these proceedings.  \n \n6 Regulation 18 (1) of the BMSMR 2005 provides that:  \n \n\u201cEvidence  \n \n1 Audio recording of 21 July 2021 marked AW1d and audio recording of 27 July 2020 marked AW le and the \nrespective transcripts were AW1a and AW1b.  \n2 Video recordings of 29 June 2020, 27 July 2020 and 29 July 2020 were marked AW1f, AW1g and AW1h \nrespectively.  Declan Pearse MacFadden v The Management          STB No. 56 of 20 20 (Waterfall Gardens)  \nCorporation Strata Title Plan No. 3602  \n4 \n 18.-(1) A Board shall not be bound to apply the rules of evidence applicable to civil \nproceedings in any court but may inform itself on any matter in such manner as it \nthinks fit. \u201d \n \n7 Having considered the dicta of the High Court decision  of Yap Sing Lee v Management \nCorporation Strata Title Plan No 1267  3 where the High Court appeared to contemplate \nthe pos sibility of the application of Parts I to III of the Evidence Act, the Board is \nnevertheless of the view that the clear wording in Regulation 18 above does not compel \nthis Board to be bound strictly by th e prov isions of the Evidence Act . In any event, the \nBoard finds that N iamh was able to give direct evidence on most of the relevant events \nsave the initial reporting of the leak  and hence, the Applicant\u2019s case in the proceedings \nwould not be adversely impa cted.  \n \nLATE FEBRUARY 2020 \u2013 31 MARCH 2020  \n \n8 The Applicant first reported that there was leakage to his unit in late  February 2020.   \nThere was some dispute between the parties as to the precise date though it was agreed it \nwas in late February  2020 .  During this time, the Applicant and his partner,  his daug hter \nNiamh  and her fianc\u00e9, Rob (i.e. altogether 4 adults) lived in th e Unit using the Master \nBedroom and Bedroom 3. \n \n9 The Board notes that while the Applicant \u2019s counsel  indicated at the start of the h earing \nthat he did not agree to the Chronology of Events as set out by the Respondent , 4 the \nApplicant tellingly did not produce another version of the timeline of events. The \nApplicant\u2019s sole witness, Niamh, was taken th rough the Chronology of Events and save \nfor the actual date of  the Applicant\u2019s call reporting the leakage in late February 2020, had \nno real significant disagreement with the Respondent\u2019s timeline.  Hence, for the purposes \nof the hearing, the Board accepts that the version of the  Respondent\u2019s Chronology of \nEvents is largely accurate. Insofar as the repairs internally to rectify the defects in the \nUnit are concerned, the Board accepts that the timeline set out in Niamh\u2019s AEIC5 is \naccurate.  \n \n10 From the period of 23 February 2020 t o 31 March 2020, the Respondent liaised with the \ndeveloper and  with at least  three  (3) contractors (i.e. Singapore Hackers, Wave Fluid, \nIGM) to ascertain the source of the leak and for the contractors to provide quotations for \nrectification works .6   In the midst of this,  on or about 16 March 2020, the Applicant and \nhis partner moved out of the Unit and entered into a lease at  #XXX  The Coterie @ 72 \nHolland Road from 16 March 2020 - 15 June 2020 . 7 While the Applicant moved out, \nNiamh and Rob stayed at t he Unit. At about the same period, sometime on or about 24 \nMarch 2020, Fiach ra returned from the USA  and moved into the Unit.  \n \n3 [2011] 2 SLR 998 at paras [59] and [60].  \n4 Respondent\u2019s Bundle of Documents (\u201cRBOD\u201d), at pp 1 -20. \n5 AEIC of Niamh at para [47].  \n6 RBOD, at pp 2 -8. \n7 Supra n 5, at para [14] and at Tab C.

This was subsequently \nextended to  1 June 2020.   Sometime between 14 April 2020 to 16 April 2020 , Loggie  \ncarried out investigations into the leakage and the source of the leak was confirmed to \noriginate from the concealed rainwater downpipe (\u201c RWDP \u201d) located in the common area \nof Waterfall Gardens , more precisely in the 9th storey above the Unit .  The  actual survey \nreport of Loggie  10 was handed to the Respondent on or about 21 May 2020. 11 In the \nmeantime, t he Respondent made arrangements to provide a water suction vacuum to the \nApplicant\u2019s unit for vacuuming out the water in the Applicant\u2019s unit  during this period .12 \n \n13 During this period, sometime around 27 April 2020, the Respondent also contacted a \ncontractor (i.e. Wave Fluid)  and the developer to cover the drainage pipe to prevent any \nrain from flowing down the RW DP but due to Covid -19 restrictions , both indicated that \nthey were unable to resume work  and/or to schedule appointments. 13 As stated above, \nthe report from Loggie was only given on 21 May 2020 due to the Covid -19 situation. \nOn 26 May 2020,  the Applicant  wrote  request ing the R espondent to pay damages for the \nrectification works  and rental expenses  that were  incurred.14 \n \nPOST CIRCUIT BREAKER PERIOD  \n \n14 From 5 June 2020, the Respondent liaised with at least 3 contractors (Wave Fluid, IGM, \nLTC Coat) for final quotation s for rectification works pursuant to Mr Loggie\u2019s report.  15 \nFurther  rental expenses  were  also incurred  by the Applicant  when Niamh and Fiachra \nmoved to separate  alternative accommodation  for the period from  3 July 2020 to 10 \nOctober 2020 . \n \n15 During this period, correspondence w as exchanged between both parties on damages \npayable to the Applicant  and when the Respondent could access the Applicant\u2019s unit to \ncommence rectification works.16 The loss adjusters from the Respondent\u2019s insurers, \n \n8 RBOD , at p 8 s/no. 20.  \n9 Id, at p 8 s/no. 21 . \n10Id, at pp 37 -50. \n11Id, at p 13  s/no. 39 . \n12 Id, at pp 9 -13. \n13 Id, at p 10 s/no. 28 &  p 13 s/no. 40.  \n14 Id, at p 13 s/no. 41.  \n15 Id, at p 14 s/no. 44.  \n16 Id, at p 14 s/no. 45 \u2013 p 18 s/no. 58.

The \ninternal works relating to the pipes in the Unit was done on 23 July 2020 and reinstated \ncompl etely on 13 August 2020 by LTC Coat at the Respondent\u2019s expense.  \n \n16 Thereafter, the rectification works in the Unit commenced on or around 27 July 2020 by \nInterior File and hacking works completed by 29 July 2020. Interior File came back to \ninstall the doors , door frames on 21 -22 September 2020 with painting works done on 23 \nand 24 September 2020. Thereafter, wardrobes were installed on 1 and 2 October 2020 \nand 5 and 12 October 2020.19 In the interim, Big Red Pte Ltd (\u201cBig Red\u201d) supplied and \ninstalled the replacement wooden flooring as well as conducted dehumidifying \nprocedures from 30 July \u2013 16 September 2020.  \n \nORDER  SOUGHT BY THE APPLICANT  \n \n17 The Applicant seeks the following order : \n \n\u201cAn Order for the Respondent to compensate the Applicant for all costs and \nexpenses incurred in respect of all damage and consequential loss, including but \nnot limited to, repair and/or rectification works and costs of alternative \naccommodation, arising out of or in connection with the leak from the bu ilding \nrainwater drainage downpipe in the common area of Waterfall Gardens \nCondominium. \u201d \n \n LIST OF AGREED ISSUES  \n \n18 The list of agreed issues were  as follows:  \n \n(a) Whether  the Respondent is liable in respect of the leak;  \n \n(b) Whether the Respondent is in breach of its duty to maintain the RWDP;  \n \n(c) Whether  there was inordinate delay by the Respondent in establishing the cause \nof the leak and the repair of the same;  and \n \n(d) Whether the Respondent is liable in respect of the damage to the Applicant\u2019s \nunit and the costs of alternative accommodation . \n \n19 If the Respondent was liable in respect of the leak, the Board also had to consider  the \n \n17 Id, at p 18 s/no. 59.  \n18 Id, at pp 51 -59. \n19 Supra n 5, at para [47]. Declan Pearse MacFadden v The Management          STB No. 56 of 20 20 (Waterfall Gardens)  \nCorporation Strata Title Plan No. 3602  \n7 \n extent of  damage to award the Applicant pursuant to section 101(3) of the Building \nMaintenance and Strata Management Act  (Cap. 30C, 2008 Rev Ed) (\u201c BMSMA \u201d), given \nthat the leakage to the Unit was from a concealed RWDP located in common property.  \n \n20 The Applicant claim ed for the rectification of damages to the Unit  arising from the \nleakage and rental for himself and his family during the period when rectification works \nwere performed with respect to the said leakage.  The Respondent d id not dispute that the \nleakage was from the co ncealed RWDP but submit ted that the existence of this pipe was \nnot known to the Respondent prior to this incident and that the Respondent could not \nhave carried out maintenance over the RWDP. 20  In that respect, the Respondent argues \nthat it could not have been responsible / liable for the cause of the leakage and/or that \nthere was nothing that the Respondent could have done to prevent the leakage from the \nRWDP from occurring. 21 \n \nBOARD\u2019S FINDINGS  \n \n21 The Board found that issues in the above paragraphs [18 (a)] and [18(b)] are inextricably \nlinked and the Respondent\u2019s liability, if any, must be flowing from the statutory duty \nimposed on the Respondent or any cause of action the Applicant  had against the \nRespondent.  \n \nWhether the Respondent is liable in respect of the leak  \n \n22 For the purposes of the hearing, both parties agreed that the RWDP is common property.   \n \n23 It was the Respondent\u2019s expert witness, Loggie \u2019s evidence that access to the RWDP had \nto be done by \u201c a specialist contractor using trained industrial rope access personnel \nwhereby the common concealed rainwater downpipe duct was hacked and exposed at 3 \naccess locations before concluding the location of the pipe failure \u2026\u201d  Clearly, the \nleakage was from common property and was not within any SP\u2019s unit.  As the RWDP is \ncommon property, it followed that the Respondent would be responsible for matters \ndealing wi th the common property.  \n \nWhether the Respondent was in breach of its duty to maintain the RWDP  \n \n24 It is apposite to examine the manner in which the Applicant formulate d his case in his \nsubmissions.  The Applicant took the position that his action was twofold : -  \n \n(a) An action in negligence and/or  \n \n(b) Action in breach of the Respondent\u2019s statutory duty under section 29 of  the \nBMSMA to maintain the RWDP .22 \n \n20 Respondent\u2019s Opening Statement (\u201cROS\u201d), at paras [2] and [3].  \n21 Id, at paras [5], [6] and [11].  \n22 Applicant\u2019s closing submissions, at para [17].  Declan Pearse MacFadden v The Management          STB No. 56 of 20 20 (Waterfall Gardens)  \nCorporation Strata Title Plan No. 3602  \n8 \n 25 However, the A pplicant\u2019s submissions seemed to focus substantially on the statutory duty \nunder section 29 of the BMSMA.  The relevant provisions of section 29 of the BMSMA \n(cited by the Applicant) namely s ections 29(1)(a) and 29(1) (b)(i) are set out below : - \n \n\u201cDuties an d powers of management corporation in respect of property  \n29.-(1) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (3), it shall be the duty of the \nmanagement corporation \u2013 \n(a) \u2026to control, manage and administer the common property for the benefit of all \nthe subsidiary proprietors constituting the management corporation;  \n \n(b) to properly maintain and keep in a state of good and serviceable repair \n(including where reasonably necessary, renew or replace the whole or part \nthereof ) - \n(i) the common property ; \n\u2026\u201d \n \n26 The perti nent provision appears to be section 29(1)(b) (i) of the BMSMA.  The MCST\u2019s \nduty is prescribed as being to properly maintain and keep in a state of good and \nserviceable repair the common property and in this case, the RWDP.  This duty is \nmandatory and non delegable.  In the Board\u2019s opinion, it matters no t that the MCST could \nnot have known of the existence of the RWDP as argued by the Respondent.  The fact \nremains that so long as the RWDP is common property, the du ty falls on the Respondent.  \nThere is also no argument that the Respondent did not properly maintain and keep the \nRWDP in a state of good and serviceable repair.  \n \n27 The Applicant relies on the Court of Appeal case of Keller Piano Co (Pte) Ltd v \nManagement Corporation Strata Plan No. 1298  23 (\u201cKeller Piano\u201d ).  This  was a case \nwhere the subsidiary proprietor in a shopping mall brought an action against the MCST \nfor damages caused by a leakage to its unit as a result of leakage from the pipe above the \nunit.  Keller Piano  dealt with a case brought for (i) negligence an d (ii) for breach of the \nMCST\u2019s statutory duty to maintain and keep  the pipe  in a state of good and serviceable \nrepair.  Keller Piano\u2019s  case for breach of statutory duty failed and the matter was no \nlonger pursued on this ground.  Rather, the Court of Appe al dealt with the argument of \nres ipsa loquit ur on the basis of the case run in negligence.  \n \n28 It is important to place Keller Piano  in its right context when examining the Applicant\u2019s \narguments on the res ipsa loquit ur principle.  As pointed out above, apart from a fleeting \nreference to negligence, the Applicant has not developed his case on this ground any \nfurther.  In the Board\u2019s vi ew, the argument of res ipsa loquit ur has no place in arguments \nrelating to a case based on breach of statutory duty.  \n \n29 The Board notes that the only direct evidence on the duty to maintain the RWDP was \ncanvassed by the Respondent\u2019s expert, Loggie, who opin ed that \u201c\u2026\u2026 it is not practical \n \n23 [1994] 3 SLR(R) 965.  Declan Pearse MacFadden v The Management          STB No. 56 of 20 20 (Waterfall Gardens)  \nCorporation Strata Title Plan No. 3602  \n9 \n or possible for the MCST and/or their service providers to inspect and maintain a \nconcealed rainwater downpipe as an act of preventive maintenance\u2026. \u201d 24  \n \n30 However, the Board views this statement as self -serving and intended purely for the \nRespondent\u2019s case.  The pertinent report to study is the contemporaneous report of Loggie \ndated 20 May 2020 which followed the site inspection s on 14, 15 and 16 April 2020.  The \nscope of Loggie was \u201c\u2026..to carry out an inspection and  report on the causation of water \nseepage to Unit # XXX (Block 10) and to propose corrective repairs \u2026  .\u201d 25  The expert \nwas appointed to find out the cause of the leak to recommend the appropriate remedial \nmeasures.   It was not to apportion or delegate res ponsibilities stipulated for in the statute.  \n \n31 Even if the Board was wrong on this, Loggie\u2019s opinion does not assist as he has opined \nthat it is not practical or possible  to inspect and maintain.  The duty on the MCST does \nnot invo lve questions of practicality.  It is a mandatory positive duty to properly \nmaintain  and keep it in a state of good and serviceable repair.  As such, the Board is of \nthe opinion that the Respondent was in breach of this positive duty to properly maintain \nthe RWDP.  \n \n32 The Respondent relied on three ( 3) cases  26 to show that the onus remains on the \nApplicant to prove negligence or default. None of the  three  (3) cases cited assists the \nBoard  as they do not deal with the relevant provisions in the BMSMA.   \n \n33 Although  neither party submitted any cases directly relevant to the interpretation o f the \nrelevant provision in the BMSMA, the Board finds that the High Court of New South \nWales case of Seiwa Pty Ltd v. Owners Strata Plan 35042  27 is relevant.  In this case, the \nowner of a unit commenced proceedings for damages and injunction against the owners \ncorporation (equivalent of our MCST) for inter alia, alleged breach of duty to maintain \nthe common property. The relevant section 62 of the (NSW)  Strata Management Act \n1996 states: - \n \n\u201c62. What are the duties of an owners corporation to maintain and repair \nproperty?   \n  \n(1)  An owners corporation must properly maintain and keep in a state of good and \nserviceable repair the common property and any personal property in the owners \ncorporation \u201d \n \n34 As the court there observed, \u201c\u2026 section 62(1) imposes on owners corporation a duty to \nmaintain , and keep in a state of good and serviceable repair , the common property.  The \nduty is not one to use reasonable care to maintain and keep in good repair the common \nproperty, nor one to use best endeavours to do so, nor one to take reasonabl e steps to do \n \n24 AEIC of Loggie, at para [17(c)].  \n25 Supra n 6, at p 38 para [1.1].  \n26 Respondent\u2019s Submissions, at para [24]. \n27 [2006] NSWSC 1157.

This in \nturn will not absolve the Respondent of liability even if they were unaware of the state \nof the RDWP or maintenance thereof.   As such, the Board finds that th e Respondent was \nin breach of its statutory duty to maintain and keep in good repair the RWDP and as \nsuch, liable for the leak from the RWDP into the Unit.  \n \nWhether there was inordinate delay by the Respondent establishing the cause of the leak \nand the rep air of the same  \n \n36 The Applicant has raised an issue as to the delay in establishing the cause of the leak and \nrepair.  In doing so, the Applicant has submitted that the Respondent was (i) \nunprofessional/inefficient in handling the rectification  and/or  (ii) failed to carry out repair \nworks during the Circuit Breaker period.  There has also been some disagreement on \nwhether the Applicant had contributed to this delay as well.  \n \n37 The Board notes that when confronted with the Chronology of Events in detail  and inspite \nof Applicant\u2019s counsel\u2019s position at the opening of the hearing , the Applicant\u2019s only \nwitness was unable to point to any real or significant delay in the investigations carried \nout as well as the repair works done by the Respondent.  In this r egard, the Board had \nalso indicated that it had taken \u201cjudicial notice\u201d or the equivalent of a fact well recognized \nthat a Circuit Breaker period had been imposed by the Government from 7 April 2020 to \n1 June 2020.  The Board accepts that the Respondent\u2019s arguments are cogent and that for \nall the general allegations of inordinate delay, the Applicant was unable to point to any \nsuch significant period of delay.  As such, the Applicant was unable to prove any \ninordinate delay on the part of the Respondent in e stablishing the cause of the leak and \nrepair.  \n \n38 In the Board\u2019s view, both the Circuit Breaker period (which was unprecedented in \nSingapore\u2019s recent history) of eight ( 8) weeks coupled with the difficulty of actually \nascertaining the source of the leak clearly contributed to the delay in rectifying the leak.  \nIn this regard, the observations in the expert evidence of Loggie (being unchallenged) is \ngermane to this issue.   \n \n\u201c17.  I would conclude by stating the following:  \n \n(a) The initial investigation works carried out by the previously engaged \ncontractor/s assisted in my investigation.  \n \n(b) The as -built drawings made available did not show the existence of the \nconcealed rainwater downpipe which was concluded to be the source of the \n \n28 Id, at p ara [3].

However, regardless, it would be \nreasonable to first proceed with an inspection, testing as appropriate to \naccessible areas prior to opening up of the common ser vice duct as carried out \nby the previously engaged contractor/s to eliminate the closest and most \nprobable source of the water seepage. \u201d \n \nWhether the Respondent is liable in respect of the damage to the Applicant\u2019s unit and the \ncosts of alternative accommodation  \n \n39 There are 2 distinct heads of claims here, namely : - \n \n(a) Costs of rectification of damages to Applicant\u2019s unit; and  \n(b) Cost of alternative accommodation.  \n \n40 The Board notes that the Respondent\u2019s closing submissions did not deal, in any d etail, on \nthe various quantum claims as the Respondent seems to have hung their case on the \nliability peg almost entirely.  Nevertheless, the Board is required to investigate and \ndetermine on the quantum of claims made and to that extent, some of the cross  \nexamination by Respondent\u2019s counsel assists.  \n \n41 The Board  notes that it is  empowered to award damages pursuant to section 101(1)(a) \nand 101(3) of the BMSMA which state as follows : - \n \n\u201cGeneral power to make orders to settle disputes or rectify complaints, etc.  \n101.-(1) Subject to subsections (4), (6) and (7), a Board may, pursuant to an \napplication by a management corporation  or subsidiary management \ncorporation , a subsidiary proprietor, mortgagee in possession, lessee or occupier \nof a lot in a subdivided building, make an order for the settlement of a dispute, or \nthe rectification of a complaint, with respect to - \n(a) any defect in a lot, a subdivided building or its common property or limited \ncommon property ; \n\u2026 \n(3) Any order made under subsection (1), except an order made with respect to the \nexercise or performance of, or the failure to exercise or perform, a power, duty or \nfunction conferred or imposed by this Act or the by -laws, may provide for the \npayment of damages not exceeding an a mount that may be ordered by a District \nCourt if the dispute had been the subject of civil proceedings in that Court .\u201d \n \nThe onus remains on the Applicant to prove that he and the occupants in the Unit w ere \ndeprived of the use of the Unit as a result of the leak. Equally , the Board also notes that \nthis claim for damages is necessarily subject to the issue of remoteness and more crucially \nthe principle of mitigation of damages. I n Cristian Priwisata Yacob and  another v Declan Pearse MacFadden v The Management          STB No. 56 of 20 20 (Waterfall Gardens)  \nCorporation Strata Title Plan No. 3602  \n12 \n Wibowo Boediono and another and another suit  29, George Wei J held that it is clear that \nthe duty to mitigate  arises in respect of both claims in  tort and contract.  \n \n(i) Costs of rectification of damages to Applicant\u2019s unit  \n \n42 The Board reviewed the tabulation of the expenses / costs incurred by the Applicants with \nrespect to damages to the Applicant\u2019s property as a result of the leakage:30  \nS/N Description of invoice  Amount  \n1 Interior File  31 $17,542.65  \n2 Big Red  Invoice 32 $13,268.00  \n3 Report Fees of Big Red  $374.50  \n4 Cost of deploying humidifiers 33 $1,498.00  \n5 Strip Light for Wardrobes  $190.00  \nTotal:  $32,873.15  \n \n43 In relation to Interior File\u2019s costs of repairs of amounting to $17,542.65, the Board notes \nthat the repairs were to make good defects to the Master Bedroom, Bedroom 2 (identified \nas Bedroom 1 in the quote) and the hallway .  The Respondent\u2019s loss adjust ors, Toplis, \nalso opined that the necessary repairs would have involved : - \n \n(a) The timber floor of the master bedroom, half of the next bedroom and a third of \nthe passageway;  \n(b) The built -in wardrobes in the master bedroom and bedroom  1; and \n(c) The timber doorframes i n the master bedroom and master toilet.  \n \n44 The Board is of the opinion that there is no justifiable reason why there should be any \napportionment of liability in this case and rejects the loss adjustor\u2019s apportionment \nattempts.  The Board also notes that the r evised Interior File invoice for the actual work \ndone dated 25 October 2020  34  for $17,542.65 is substantially lower than the first  quote \nfrom Interior File dated 5 June 2020 as the former invoice d id not include the items for \nthe supply and installation of the American Oak flooring as well as  work to Niamh\u2019s  \nroom. The Board therefore allows for the claim on Interior\u2019s file for the full sum of \n$17,542.65.  \n \n45 In relation to the Big Red invoice, the Board notes that Big Red was used to supply and \ninstall the American Oak flooring as Interior File was unable to do so. However , the \ninvoice does not make clear if the flooring in Bedroom s 2 and 3 were also changed as \nthere are sanding and varnishing works on Bedroom s 2 and 3 as well.  Neither party has \ntendered detailed submissions on the quantum claimed.   The Board will therefore allow \n \n29 [2017] SGHC 8, at para [310].  \n30 Joint AEIC  of Victor Fong Whye Phoy and Edison,  at para [22] and also p p 88 to 91 of RBOD . \n31 Supra n 5, at para [46] and Tab U.  \n32 Id, at para  [45] and Tab T.  \n33 Id, at para [44] and Tab S.  \n34 Id, at Tab U .

The \nBoard also agrees with the Respondent that representatives from Big Red were not called \nto testify with regards to the necessity of incurring expenses for conducting moisture \nmeter testing and the use of dehumidifiers  38 and without evidence supporting the same, \nthese were unnecessa ry. The Board disallows the claims for these two (2) items and the \nstrip light for wardrobes amounting to $190.  \n \n47 Hence , the total allowed for the repairs by Big Red would be $12,112.40 for the \nreinstatement works  being ($12,400 -$1,080 = $11,320 + $792.40 (GST) ). The total sum \nallowed for the rectification works is $29,655.05 .  \n \n(ii) Cost of alternative accommodation  \n \n48 The Board also noted the Applicant\u2019s claims for rental for himself and his family during \nthe period when rectification works were performe d arising from the leakage : \n \n49 In principle, the Board is of the view that claims for rental costs of alternate \naccommodation is permissible.

A very brief submission was made by the defendants that such a claim for \u2018loss \nin rental was pure economic loss in tort which is too remote, and not of a dangerous \nnature, and therefore cannot be claimed\u2019.  No authority was cited  to support the \nsubmission.  Having reviewed the law in this area, I find the submission wholly \nmisconceived in these circumstances. Water leaking into a home would \nundoubtedly affect the comfort of its occupants.  The more severe and prolonged \nthe leakage , the more severe the extent of the damage.  If it results in the owner \nbeing deprived the use of premises, then rental costs of alternative \naccommodation  (in owner occupied situations) or loss of rental (in rented out \nsituations) would be claimable since both flow directly from the damage caused.   \nIn either situation, costs of repairs would also be claimable. \u201d \n \n50 In this regard, the unique feature of th e present case is that the Applicant has hoisted \nclaims for three ( 3) separate accommodations arising out of the leakage in the Unit over \nthree ( 3) separate periods stretching from 16 March 2020  - 10 October 2020.  \n \nAPPLICANT AND PARTNER  \n \n51 The Applicant and his partne r moved out with effect from 16 March 2020.  While the \nleak to the unit would have affected the Master bedroom occupied by the Applicant and \nhis partner, the Board accepts the Respondent\u2019s challenge and contention that there was \nno reason why the Applicant  and his partner had to move out from 16 March 2020, \nconsidering that there was a spare room available.  No evidence of any attempt to use the \nspare bedroom 3 or convert it for the Applicant\u2019s use was shown.  The Board opines that \nthe Applicant was unable to show directly or otherwise that the alternate accommodation \nwas necessary and that he and his partner could not remain there in the Unit.  As such, \nthe claim for the Applicant\u2019s alternate accommodation amounting to $12,600 is \ndisallowed.  \n \nNIAMH AND ROB AND FIACHRA  \n \n52 Niamh and Rob entered into a tenancy agreement at the Coterie as well for three ( 3) \nmonths from 3 July 2020.  Almost concurrently at the same time (from 5 July \u2013 2 October \n2020), Fiachra signed another lease at the Fortville from 5 July 2020.  Collectively, the \nclaims in rental came up to $8,400 and $9,700 respectively.  \n \n53 Considering the proximity of dates around which they had moved out of their unit, there \ndoes not seem to be any logical reason as to why both Niamh and Fiachra could not have \nmoved to one bigger unit  even if they had to .  This is especially so considering all the \nmembers of the family had always been under one roof.  Secondly, it has not been proven \nto the Board\u2019s satisfaction that both the siblings had to even move out by early July 2020.  Declan Pearse MacFadden v The Management          STB No. 56 of 20 20 (Waterfall Gardens)  \nCorporation Strata Title Plan No. 3602  \n15 \n The need, if at all, to move out would only surface when the real heavy works \ncomme nced.  Of course, it would not be reasonable to expect the lease to commence only \nwhen the work begins as there would be some uncertainty as to when the work would \nactually commence.  However from the timeline of events  43, it would appear that the \nreinsta tement of internal pipes was completed on 23 July 2020 and the hacking \ncommenced on 27 July 2020 was completed on 29 July 2020 . Thirdly , both Niamh and \nRob were occupying Bedroom 2 which was not proven to be adversely affected by the \nleak. The Board saw no  reason why the claims by Ni amh and R ob for the full three ( 3) \nmonths of alternative accommodation was reaso nable in the circumstances. The Board \nhas, however, given d ue consideration  for Fiachra\u2019s medical condition and the Board has \ndecided that for all the above reasons and the duty of the Appl icant to act reasonably to \nmitigate the damages as well as factoring in the intensity and frequency of the \nrectification works, the Board will allow for two ( 2) months of Fiachra\u2019s rental which \nwas a  higher figure than Ni amh\u2019s alternative accommodation. This would be a total of \n$6,000 .  \n \nBOARD\u2019S DECISION  \n \n54 The Board hereby order s that the Respondent do pay the Applicant the sum of  $49,055.05 \ncomprising:  \n \na the sum of $35,655.05 in damages being:  \n  (i) $29,655.05 for the actual rectification works in the Unit; and  \n  (ii) $6,000 for the alternative accomodation;  \n \nb the sum of $1,400 comprising the STB Application Fee of $500 and Heari ng \nFees of $900 (i.e. $300 x 3 days) for the arbitration hearings on 9 February 2021, \n10 February 2021 and 13 April 2021; and  \n \nc legal c osts of $12,000.  \n \nwithin fourteen (14) days from the date of this Order.  \n \nDated this 13th day of April  2021 \n \n \n \n        _________________________ __ \n        Mr Oommen Mathew   \n        Deputy President  \n \n \n \n43 Supra n 5.

Zainal Abidin de Silva / Norjahan Binte     STB No. 51 of 2020 (Braddell View Estate)  \nMohamed Saleh v Choy Kok Meng  \n4 \n b. If so, whether the Respondent had rebutted the statutory presumption under section \n101(8) of the Act; and    \n \nc. whether the Applicants were estopped from filing this application because the \nmatter of  water leakage s had been litigated before in the Courts.  \n \nTHE APPLICANTS \u2019 CASE  \n \n7 The Applican ts\u2019 case was that the water leakage started from April 2020.2  However, at \nSection E of their application to the Strata Titles Boards, the Applicants observed that \nsometime in early 2018, there was already water seepage from the wall and ceiling \nadjourning the external wall and common toilet at the Applicants \u2019 dining area. At that \npoint in time, t he Management Corporation (\u201cMC\u201d) had written to the Respondent on th e \nseepage incident and when  the Respondent di d not respon d, the MC proceeded to do  \ngrouting works at the Applicants\u2019  unit in June 2018 to prevent further seepage.3 \n \n8 On or about  April 2020, it is the Applicants\u2019 case that besides the seepage at the di ning \narea, there was also water seepage at the App licants\u2019 master bedroom wall adjourning \nthe master bedroom toilet .  Four (4) letters were sent  by the MC  to the Respondent on the \nwater seepages  which repeated that the burden lies on the Respondent (i.e. the upper floor \nunit owner) to prove the contrary ( i.e. that the water leakage was not from his unit).  T here \nwas no response from the Respondent  to the letters and this application was subsequently \nfiled on 8 September 2020 . 4 \n \n9 The Applicants \u2019 case is that t he water leakage  matter  litigated in the Courts was for the \nperiod March 2008 to 6 January 2010.5 They argued that every fresh spate of water \nleakage from the Respondent\u2019s premises to the Applicants\u2019 premises gives rise to new \nclaim(s) for legal remedies and that they are not estopped from comme ncing with these \nproceedings.6 \n \nTHE RESPONDENT\u2019S CASE  \n \n10 The Respondent denies the Applicants\u2019 Expert \u2019s report that there was water leakage from \nhis unit to the Applicants\u2019 unit  and alleges the Applicants\u2019 leakage claims to be a scam \nfor the Applicants to make a quick profit  as the Applicants had succeeded  in a water \nleakage matter filed against the Respondent at the State Courts in 2008 with final \njudgment  obtained in 2011 .7 The Applicants had \u201c enjoyed the windfalls \u201d8 from the \nprevious Court matters wherein a sum of $50,831.24 was awarded to the Applicants , paid \n \n2 Affidavit of evidence in chief in reply of Zainal Abidin De Silva & Norjahan Binte Mohamed Saleh dated 13 \nJanuary 2021 at paragraph [7].  \n3 Document marked as \u201cAA\u201d at Section E(b)  S/Nos. 1 - 3. \n4 Applicant\u2019s Opening Statement (\u201cAOS\u201d) dated 20 January 2021 at paragraph 6 with reference to the Affidavit \nof evidence -in-chief (\u201cAEIC\u201d) of Zainal Abidin De Silva at pp 68 -69 and pp 71 -76. \n5 Supra n 2, at paragraph [6].  \n6 Supra n 2, at paragraph [8].  \n7 AEIC of Choy Kok Meng dated 28 December 2020 and at S/Nos. 6 & 7.  \n8 Affidavit of evidence in chief in reply (\u201cReply Affidavit\u201d) of Choy Kok Meng affirmed  before the Board on 26 \nJanuary 2021 under the sub -heading \u201c Affidavit of Evidence -in-Chief of Zainal Abidin De Silva \u201d.

The Respondent further cast doubts on the efficacy of the \nmoisture meter 17 used by the said Expert and on his curriculum vitae.18 \n \nBOARD\u2019S FINDINGS  \n \n13 The Board accepts the evidence of the Applicants\u2019 Ex pert, Mr Wong Yew Fai  (\u201cMr \nWong\u201d) , that there was water leakage / seepage  from the Respondent\u2019s unit  into the \nApplicants \u2019 unit. The evidence given by the Applicants\u2019 Expert, Mr Wong Yew Fai, was \n\u201c\u2026because  of: (1). missing cement pointing , used water trapped in the gaps between the \ntiles of the Respondent\u2019s bathroom could not di scharge directly to the water outlet and \nhad therefore caused the floor at the bathroom of the Respondent\u2019s Premises to be always \nin damp or wet condition and this condition together with  (2). water seepage that was \nprobably due to a leaking water tap at t he washing area of the Respondent\u2019s Premises \nhad caused the water seepage defects at the balcony, dining room, common bathroom, \nand master bathroom of the Applicants\u2019 Premises. \u201d 19 \n \n14 During th e cross -examination of Mr Wong by the Respondent,  the Respondent cast \ndoubts on the efficacy of the two -pin moisture mete r to detect moisture and the  exchange  \ngoes as follows : \n \n \n9 Supra n 7, at S/No. 5.  \n10Supra n 7, at S/No. 9.  \n11Supra n 7, at S/No. 11(b).  \n12Supra n 7, at S/No. 10(a) to 10(d).  \n13Supra n 8, under the sub -heading \u201cAffidavit of Evidence -in-Chief of Wong Yew Fai\u201d at S/No. 5.  \n14Supra n 8, under the sub -heading \u201cAffidavit of Evidence -in-Chief of Wong Yew Fai  \u2013 3.1 State of Condition at \nUnit 07 -18\u201d at d). \n15Supra n 8, under the sub -heading \u201cAffidavit of Evidence -in-Chief of Wong Yew Fai  \u2013 3.1 State of Condition at \nUnit 07 -18\u201d at h).  \n16Supra n 8, under the sub -heading \u201cAffidavit of Evidence -in-Chief of Wong Yew Fai  \u2013 3.1 State of Condition at \nUnit 07 -18\u201d at d) and j).  \n17 Supra n 8, under the sub -heading  \u201cAffidavit of Evidence -in-Chief of Wong Yew Fai \u2013 3.1 State of Condition at \nUnit 07 -18\u201d from k) to o).  \n18 Supra n 8, under the sub -heading \u201cAffidavit of Evidence -in-Chief of Wong Yew Fai \u201d at S/Nos. 7 & 8.  \n19 Affidavit of Evidence -in-Chief in Reply of Wong Yew  Fai dated 19 January 2021 at paragraph [7].

In principle, how does it work ? \n\u2026 \nA It\u2019s conductivity. It\u2019s conductivity. It works on conductivity but \nelectronics, how it  - - \n\u2026    \nA -- functions, I cannot explain because I\u2019m not the expert of that.  But \nI follow the user manual, -- and I use it accordingly.  And it\u2019s suitable \nfor both timber and concrete, it\u2019s stated very clearly in the manual .\u201d \n20 \n \n\u201cQ \u2026You know, two -pin, you know, the size of the pin is a pin and you \nmeasure a few points and you say that a pin is supposed to be -- the \ntwo pin is supposed to be injected into the concrete or into the wood.  \nAny two pins, they are not on the surface, you can\u2019t measure \nconductivity on a surface.  \n\u2026 \nMr Choy:  \u2026Do you know the two pins have to be inserted?  \nA. The pin is the sensor. We are checking the moisture content on the \nsurface. Can  be -- if not painted, bare concrete tiles, hard surface, \nbare concrete, so we are checking the condition of the surface, not \nnecessary concrete.  \n\u2026 \nQ We are talking about concrete and we are not even talking about \nwood, wood you can even pierce through wit h the two pins but \nconcrete, dry concrete you can pierce with the two pins? Surface \u2013 \nsurface wetness as you can touch it and then you can --that is not the \ntrue measurement.  \nA. The user manual did not say that I must pierce through the concrete. \u201d \n21 \n \n15 Based on  the manual of the moisture mete r submitted by the Applicants during the \nhearing  22, the Board notes that under the heading s \u201c2. Specification \u201d and  \u201c4. Measuring \nProcedure \u201d, it was stated that in relation to the application of the moisture mete r it was \n\u201cDesigned to check the moisture level of wood, concrete and other non -wood material \u201d \nand \u201c3) It is recommended that the test pins are inserted to a minimum depth of 2mm into \nthe material under tes t. If a depth of 2mm cannot be obtained, then insert the test pins to \ntheir maximum achievable depth \u201d, respectively.  From the evidence adduced, the Board \ndoes not find  that it is necessary for the 2 pins of the moisture meter to be embedded into \nthe concrete areas in order to obtain relevant  readings .  The Board noted the Expert\u2019s \nevidence that \u201cMoisture meter readings revealed that high intensity of moisture readings \nbeyond 60 (Wet) at area directly below the bath room s areas\u201d.23  \n \n \n20 Transcript of 25 January 2021 at Page 37 Line 23 to Page 38 Line 11.  \n21 Id, at Page 39 Line 23 to Page 41 Line 8.  \n22 Document was marked as \u201cA -1\u201d. \n23 AEIC of Wong Yew Fai dated 23 December 2020 at p 25, paragraph  3.0(d).  Zainal Abidin de Silva / Norjahan Binte     STB No. 51 of 2020 (Braddell View Estate)  \nMohamed Saleh v Choy Kok Meng  \n7 \n 16 The Board agrees with the Applicants\u2019 submission that less weight is to be given to the \nRespondent\u2019s opinion  evidence with respect to the source of water leakage and the use of \nthe moisture mete r given that the Respondent was not an expert in water leakage matters.  \nThe Respondent was an electrical engineer by training and a systems engineer before his \nretirement and the Board notes in Yap Boon Fong Yvonne v Wong Kok Mun Alvin and \nanother  that whe re a witness of fact is offering opinion evidence, the evidence so given \nwas admissible if there was no other person in a better position than that witness to render \nthe said opinion evidence. Although this is not the case here as the Respondent could \nhave  appointed a qualified building surveyor or civil / structural engineer, if he so wished,  \nto be his expert witness, the fact that it was the applicant / respondent himself giving \nopinion evidence will only affect the weight to be given to the evidence.24   \n \n17 The Board notes that the Respondent had made sweeping statements of opinion e.g. that \nreinforced concrete is not permeable to water and that \u201c residue water has not the energy \nto force through \u201d such concrete; but has not been able to substantiate them in  any way.25  \nThis contrasts not just with the views of the Applicants\u2019 Expert but with the generally \naccepted view among building professionals that concrete is permeable to water  and \nwater will  find its level over time (cf People\u2019s Park Complex [1990] SGS TB 3 and similar \nfindings in other STB cases), necessitating the installation of waterproofing membranes \netc.  The Board therefore thus places less weight on the evidence from the Respondent, \nin comparison to the Applicants\u2019 Expert\u2019s evidence.  \n \n18 The Board further notes that the Applicants\u2019 Expert did not solely rely on the moisture \nmete r reading s in arriving at  his conclusion and recommendation . 26 The said Expert had \nconducted visual inspections of both parties\u2019 units and visited the units on 2 separate \noccasions i.e. 2 December 2020 and 16 December 2020 .  The said Expert documented \nextensively on the dampness patches found in the Applicants\u2019 unit  and the Board did not \nfind any basis to doubt his findings and/or  credentials as a professional civil and struc tural \nengineer.  \n \n19 The Board also finds the Respondent to have created a new \u201cwet\u201d washing area by \nleveling the balcony to the same level as the utility and kitchen area  (a map of the \nRespondent\u2019s unit is provided below), which may be a source of leakage to the \nApplicants\u2019 unit as there was no waterproofing done at the new \u201cwet\u201d washing area.  \n \n24 Yap Boon Fong Yvonne v Wong Kok Mun Alvin and another  [2018] SGHC 26 at paragraphs [96] -[102].  \n25 AEIC of Choy Kok Meng dated 28 December 2020 at S/Nos. 9, 10d.) and 11a) and Reply Affidavit  of Choy \nKok Meng affirmed before the Board on 26 January 2021  at S/No. 9g), and under the sub -heading \u201c Wong YF \nconclusion and recommendation \u201d.  \n26 Supra n 23,  at p 26, paragraphs 4.2 to 4.5.  Zainal Abidin de Silva / Norjahan Binte     STB No. 51 of 2020 (Braddell View Estate)  \nMohamed Saleh v Choy Kok Meng  \n8 \n  \nThe Respondent gave evidence of the leveling of the flooring for the balcony area  and \nthat no waterproofing was done  as follows 27: \n \n\u201cMr Zahidi :  \u2026the second question, is it also the same time that you relocate the   \nwash area and the kitchen, about the same time?  \nA.  I just knocked the wall down . \nMr Zahid i:  Okay . \nA. Knocked the wall down, we don\u2019t cook very much\u2026  \n\u2026 \nMr Zahidi :  \u2026Did you make any opening in the floor for the kitchen, that means do \nyou have anything \u2013 \nA, No, no, we do not make any kitchen. You see, the so -called balcony area \nis where you hang your clothes.  It was not called balcony anywa y, it\u2019s \nnot sticking out.  It\u2019s just that that is an indoor hanger where you hang \nyour clothes.  So you have a step between the kitchen and the utility \nroom, it was the utility room. And all I did not to fill up with -- fill \npartially with concrete and the other part was left as a deck. And there \nis also a  drainpipe, a drain -- \nMr Zahidi : To the new washing area?  \nA. Ah, the washing -- actually it was I did not built it, I just -- \nMr Zahidi : Lift up the floor?  \nA. Lift up the floor to that area only.  \nMr Zahidi : Okay.  \nA. Of course allowing a certain portion where there is a drain hole, a big \ndrain hole.  \nMr Zahidi : The drain hole is existing or new? \nA. I just wash my feet.  \nMr Zahidi : No, the drain hole, is it existing or new?  \nA. It is existing, it\u2019s always there, because I did not do anything to modify \n \n27 Transcript of 26 January 2021 at p 170 Line 7 to p 172 Line 2.  \nZainal Abidin de Silva / Norjahan Binte     STB No. 51 of 2020 (Braddell View Estate)  \nMohamed Saleh v Choy Kok Meng  \n9 \n the thing. That\u2019s why I dare not to touch the column or the floor, I only \nto -- \nMr Zahidi : Okay just for my understanding, there is a level difference between the \nkitchen and the ut ility area.  \nA. Yes, there is the \u2013 \nMr Zahidi : So to create the new wash area, you lift up the so -called balcony area. \nsufficient for you to have a drop into the washing \u2013 the new washing \nbay. \nA. It was a drain, it was like a drain, all the way through down there .  I \nlift up a certain portion of it.  \nMr Zahidi :  Okay . \nA. Lift it up so that it levels with my utility room and the kitchen, level up \nsame level.  \nMr Zahidi :  So -- \nA. So that I do not fall or step on the step and fall, you see.  \nMr Zahidi : Understand.  So can I  take it that now your kitchen and your utility \narea, your old kitchen and your utility area is almost the same level.  \nA. All the same level.  \nMr Zahidi  Okay.  The next question is, did you add waterproofing membrane \nwhile you are doing this lifting of the floor ? \nA. No, I didn\u2019t do any  - - I didn\u2019t do anything to those place , \n\u2026 \nbecause it was also a -- actually the drain was to -- when you wash the \nkitchen or utility room, the water supposed to drain out to that channel.  \n.. \nA. That\u2019s what HUDC was made to that eff ect. \n\u2026 \nA. All I did is to uplift a certain -- uplift so that it levels up with it.\u201d   \n \nRespondent\u2019s onus to rebut statutory presumption  \n \n20 Section 101(8) of the  Act s tates:  \n \n\u201c(8) In any proceedings under this section with respect to any all eged defect \nin a lot or in any common property or limited common property situated \nimmediately (whether wholly or partly) above another lot or any common \nproperty or limited common property, it shall be presumed, in the absence \nof proof to the contrary, that the defect is within that lot or common property \nor limited common property, as the case may be, above if there is any \nevidence of dampness, mo isture or water penetration -  \n \n(a) on the c eiling that forms part of the interior of the lot, common \nproperty or limited common pr operty, as the case may be, \nimmediately below; or  \n \n(b) on any finishing material (including plaster, panel or gypsum \nboard) attached , glued, laid or applied to the ceiling that forms \npart of the interior of the lot, common property or limited Zainal Abidin de Silva / Norjahan Binte     STB No. 51 of 2020 (Braddell View Estate)  \nMohamed Saleh v Choy Kok Meng  \n10 \n common property, as the case may be, immediately below. \u201d \n \n21 Pursuant to section 101(8) of the Act, there is a rebuttable presumption against the other  \nlot above  where there is \u201c any evidence of dampness, moisture or water penetration \u201d on \nthe ceiling of the lot below .   It is the Respondent\u2019s evidence that he did engage a water \nleakage specialist and the Applicants had engaged their Expert, namely Mr Wong\u2019s \ncompany , M/s YMW Consultants, to survey both units and to provide quotation s initially . \n28  When both experts wanted to conduct water ponding tests, it is the Respondent\u2019s \nevidence that he refused for both experts   (i.e. the Applicants\u2019 and his own  expert)  to \nconduct the water ponding tests.29  Without evidence by the Respondent to rebut the \nstatutory presumption, the leakage in the Applicants \u2019 unit would  be from the \nRespondent\u2019s unit.  \n \nApplicants may file  the present claims with the Strata Titles Boards even though water \nleakage had  previously been litigated before  in the Courts  \n \n22 The Respondent has not raised issue(s)  of an estoppel  / res judicata , but has made \nallegations of scam by the Applicants in respect of  water leakage s from his unit to the \nApplicants\u2019 unit (as per paragraph [10] above ) based on past claim (s) filed against him \nby the Applicants .  The Applicants  had also made reference s to their claims against the \nRespondent with respect to  the said  water leakages filed with  the Small Claims Tribunal \nin 200130, and at the Magistrate\u2019s Court  (\u201cMC\u201d)  in August 2008 31.  During the hearing, \nupon the Respondent\u2019s cross -examination of the Co -Applicant, Mr Zainal De Silva (\u201cMr \nZainal\u201d) on the claims filed in the MC, Mr Zainal testified that the Respondent did not \nrectify the water leakage but the Applicants did grouting works at their own unit to arrest \nthe water leakage:  \n \n\u201cQ. When the court is already awards the damages, are you happy that \nthere is n o more leakage from there on ? \nA. When the court gave the judgment, we were not happy, okay, because \nthere was still the main aim of the reason we went to court, to get it \nrepaired. It was not repaired.  Immediately after the thing, it was not \nrepaired.  \nQ, Why did you not go back to the court and says through your lawyers, \nwhy did you not go back and says \u201cI\u2019m not happy, that is not being \nsettled, I don\u2019t accept it\u201d?  Why didn\u2019t you do that?  \nA. We -- after the 2010, okay, the case actually spread because there is \nthese different stages tried by quantum, legal costs and even we have \nto go to WSS because you did not pay up, then you go by instalment. \nBy the time you finished your instalment was 2012 \u2026Right, and then \nwe waited, we wanted to repair, we have to wait that there is no \nleakage, but there was leakage.  That was the reason we employed a \ncompany to do grouting.  \n \n28 Supra n 7, at S/No. 12b.  \n29 Ibid. \n30 AEIC of Zainal Abidin De Silva dated 28 December 2020 at paragraph [8].  \n31 Id, at paragraph [9].  Zainal Abidin de Silva / Norjahan Binte     STB No. 51 of 2020 (Braddell View Estate)  \nMohamed Saleh v Choy Kok Meng  \n11 \n \u2026 \nA. We were hoping very highly that after the case, you would do a repair.  \n... \nA. \u2026because by 2012, we waited, as I said earlier. We were hoping that \nyou would do a repair, but you did not do a repair, ok ay. So we tried \nto do it with the money you gave, we tried and repaired it ourselves \nokay. We get the grouting company who gave us a g uarantee of one \nyear.  32 \n\u2026 \nMr Choy: Okay, we\u2019re talking about that case, MC Suit, 2008 right to this date, \nthere was leakage from -- until this case comes up again. Are you \nsaying that there\u2019s leakage?  \nA. The leakage starts from I do my grouting around 2012. After the \ngrouting, it stops for a while as guaranteed by the company.  14 \nmonths after the grouting, the leak starts again, because grouting is a \ntemporary measure. So long as the upper floor do not do any repair, \nthe leakage will never be removed.\u201d33 \n \n23 In view of the above, t he Board finds it useful to refer the doctrine of res judicata  \nsummarised in the headnotes of Goh Nellie v Goh Li an Teck & other [2007] 1  SLR(R) \n453 (\u201cGoh Nellie \u201d) as follows:  \n \n\u201c(2) The umbrella doctrine of res judicata encompassed three conceptually distinct \nthough interrelated  principles.  The first of these was known as \u201ccause of action \nestoppel\u201d, which prevented a party from asserting or denying as against the other \nparty the existence of a particular cause of action, the non -existence of which had \nbeen determined by a court of competent jurisdiction  in previous litigation between  \nthe parties.  \n \n(3) If the previous decision did not determine the cause of action sued on in the \nlater proceedings , that decision might still be invoked as having determined, as an \nessential step in its reasoning, an issue that proved relevant in the later case and \nfurth er consideration of the issue might  be foreclosed.  This was commonly known \nas \u201cissue estoppel\u201d.  To establish an issue estoppel: (a) there had to be final and \nconclusive judgment on the merits; (b) that judgment had to be of a court of \ncompetent jurisdict ion; (c) there had to be identi ty between the parties to the two \nactions that were being compared, and (d) there had to be identi ty of subject matter \nin the two proceedings.  \n \n(4) In some cases, where neither cause of action estoppel or issue estoppel were \navailable, a defendant might  rely on the \u201cextended doctrine  of res judicata\u201d or, as \nit were more popularly known, the d efence of abuse of process.  This was distinct \nfrom cause of action and issue estoppe ls. Cause of action estoppel and issue \nestoppel were  absolute bars to relitigation, save in the case of the latter where there \nwas a limited exception in \u201cspecial cases\u201d or \u201cspecial circumstances \u201d.

Zainal Abidin de Silva / Norjahan Binte     STB No. 51 of 2020 (Braddell View Estate)  \nMohamed Saleh v Choy Kok Meng  \n12 \n process was not subject to the same test, the task of the court being to draw the \nbalance between th e competing claims of one party to put his case before the court \nand of the other not to be unjustly hounded given the earlier history of the matter... \" \n \nCause of action estoppel  \n \n24 The Applicants gave evidence that the claims in the MC suit were for water leakages \narising from the period of March 2008 to 6 January 2010 whereas the water leakages  for \nthe present  proceedings arise  from the period of April 2020.34  It is clear to the Board that \nthere is no identity in the subject matter  filed in the MC s uit with the present proceedings , \nand therefore cause of action estoppel does not operate to prevent the Applicants from \nasserting the present claims against the Respondent.   \n \nIssue estoppel  \n \n25 Counsel for the Applicants did not make substantive submissions  on issue estoppel for \nthe present proceedings .  The Board notes from the Grounds of Decision by District Judge \nFrancis Tseng in the Applicants\u2019 MC Suit 35 that the issues traversed by the Court were \nclaims made in relation to a breach of statutory duty pursuant to section 21(b) of the \nHUDC Housing Estates Act (Cap. 131) , By-law 21 of the Second Schedule to the HUDC \nHousing Estates Act, and Section 63(b) of the Act (which the Court held is in pari materia  \nwith section 21(b) of the HUDC Hou sing Estates Act) 36, as well as  the tort of nuisance.37  \nThe issues to be addressed  in the present case are different.  The Board is of the view that \nissue estoppel  therefore does not arise / apply  in this case.  \n \nAbuse of process  \n \n26 The Respondent gave evidence as follows:  \n \n\u201cI sincerely hope that Strata Titles Board will not permit him [i.e. the Applicant (s)] \nto make such claim repeatedly.  I do not much respect when the persons whose aims \nare greed and they show no empathy.  I believe that the Applicants would continue \nto pursue fulfill his cause (to profit) perpetually for as many years to come. \u201d 38 \n \n27 The Applicants\u2019 reply was that based on common sense / general knowledge,  \u201chowever \nmuch the expenditure by us (i.e. the Applicants), the best repair and rectification works \ncannot last if there are continuing or fresh water  leakages from the Respondent\u2019s \nPremises to our Premises\u2026 \u201d and \u201c that interfloor leakage can never be repaired from the \nunit below. \u201d 39  This was not a case of repeate d claims being made against  the Respondent \nin relation to the  water leakages  for no good reason  but more of a case for the Respondent \nto do the necessary rectifications to arrest the leakages.  \n \n \n34 Supra n 2, at paragraphs [6] & [7].  \n35 Zainal Abidin De Silva and Another v Choy Kok Meng [2010] SGMC 1.  \n36 Id, at par agraph s [16] , [17], [30] and [31].   \n37 Supra n 35, at paragraphs [21] , [22], [32] and [33].  \n38 Supra n 7, at S/No. 4 . \n39 Supra n 2, at paragraphs [9] and [11].  Zainal Abidin de Silva / Norjahan Binte     STB No. 51 of 2020 (Braddell View Estate)  \nMohamed Saleh v Choy Kok Meng  \n13 \n 28 The Board is of the view therefore that the present proceeding s was not an abuse of \nprocess.  \n \nRespondent\u2019s conduct  \n \n29 The Board notes that the parties have entered into a written agreement dated 15 October \n2020 to jointly appoint a building surveyor to determine  the water leakage  issues, if any, \nand to make recommendations as to rectification, further agreeing to be bound b y the \nfindings and recommendations.  However, the Respondent did not comply with the said \nagreement because he did not agree to accepting the quotations of thos e who did not visit \nhis premises first and for those that did, he did not agree with their proposal to do a water -\nponding test as part of their investigations.  \n \n30 The Board further notes that in answer to queries from the Board at trial, the Respondent \ndid eventually say that the ponding test could be proof whether the leakage emanated \nfrom his premises , but that he did not think it should be done . In the Board\u2019s vi ew, the \nRespondent\u2019s conduct in this regard has been unreasonable resulting in the non -\ncompliance with the said agreement, which would otherwise have resolved the dispute \nwithout the need for an arbitration hearing.  \n \n31 Further, the Respondent was a \u201cno -show\u201d  for the second mediation session without any \ngood reason, despite having been informed of the date in advance and a call being made \nto him just before the start of the session.  The second mediation thus could not proceed \nand the time and attendance of th e Board panel members and the Applicants w ere wasted \nfor this purpose . \n \nBOARD\u2019S DECISION  \n \n32 The Board finds that the Respondent had not rebutted the statutory presumption under \nsection 101(8) of the Act and remains liable.  \n \n33 The Board hereby order s that: \n \n\u201c1 The Respondent shall engage, at his own cost, within two (2) weeks from the date \nof this order a Building and Construction Authority (\u201cBCA\u201d)  registered building \ncontractor to carry out and complete all necessary corrective repair(s ) to the defec ts \nin the Respondent\u2019s unit as outlined in the report of YMW Consultants dated 20 \nDecember 2020 so as to resolve the  water leakage from the Respondent\u2019s unit to \nthe Applicants \u2019 unit to the satisfaction of an independent building surveyor  / water \nseepage sp ecialist to be engaged by the Respondent , at his own cost, including the \ncosts of any tests to be recommended by the said building surveyor / water seepage \nspecialist including  water ponding tests, etc;  and \n \n2 Such corrective works stated in (1) shall be completed within ten  (10) weeks from \nthe date of this order . The report of the independent building surveyor / water \nseepage specialist as to his / her satisfaction with the corrective works shall be \ncompleted a nd extended to both the Applicants and the Respondent within two (2) \nweeks of the completion of the said corrective works .\u201d Zainal Abidin de Silva / Norjahan Binte     STB No. 51 of 2020 (Braddell View Estate)  \nMohamed Saleh v Choy Kok Meng  \n14 \n 34 The Applicants claim general damage s of the sum of $10,000, special damages of the \nsum of $5,500 and disbursements of $7,200 inclusive of all STB fees and costs of $10,000 \nfor this application .  The Board has heard both the Applicants and Respondent on these \nissues.   \n \n35 On the issue of damage s, the Board agrees that the cost of rectification of the Applicants\u2019 \nunit should be borne by the Respondent. The Board notes the error in item 1(b) of the \nApplicants\u2019 quotation found in the exhibit marked as \u201cZNDS -10\u201d of Mr Zainal\u2019s \nAffidavit of Evidence -in-Chief dated 28 December 2020 as pointed out by the \nRespondent.  The Applicants\u2019 counsel submitted that it is an obvious typographical error  \nas it should read as $280 per foot run and not that the entire cabinet of almost seven (7) \nfeet should cost only  $280.  \n \n36 The Board is of the view that the \u201cQty\u201d of one  (1) unit is an obvious typographical error.  \nWhen the dimensions of the cabinet as stated in item 1(b) is calculated with respect to the \nunit price, the total price of $1,960 would be equivalent to a c abinet of 7 feet in length \nand closely matching the dimensions stated therein .  The Panel notes that such a price for \na new cabinet of such dimensions is fair.  However, the Board agrees with the Respondent \nthat a discount to the quotation obtained by the Applicants should be factored in as the \nexisting cabinet will be replaced with a new one. The Board therefore orders damages of \nthe sum of $4,500 as costs of rectifications of the Applicants\u2019 unit.  \n \n37 The Board notes that the Applicants continued to reside in the affected unit and did not \nhave to close -down or was deprived of use of any particular part of the unit at any time. \nAs such the Board awards the sum of $2,500 as damages for inconvenience, anxiety and \nloss of enjoyment.   \n \n38 On the issue of costs and d isbursements, the Board agrees with the Applicants\u2019 \nsubmissions as fair in the circumstances and so ordered  costs of $17,200, inclusive of \nSTB and transcription fees.  \n \n \n \nDated this 25th day of March  2021  \n \n \n \n \n           _________________________  \n           Mr. Raymond Lye Hoong Yip  \n           Deputy President  \n \n \n \n           _________________________  \n            Mr. Zahidi Bin Abdul Rahman  \n            Member  Zainal Abidin de Silva / Norjahan Binte     STB No. 51 of 2020 (Braddell View Estate)  \nMohamed Saleh v Choy Kok Meng  \n15 \n  \n       \n       \n            _________________________  \n            Dr. Tan Teng Hooi  \n            Member  \n \n \nMs. Margaret Neo  Kee Heng  (M/s Hoh Law \nCorporation ) for the Applicant s. \nMr. Choy Kok Meng, Respondent  in-person.  \n \n \nClerical errors corrected on 29 March 2021.

The Respondent s are the SPs of Block 1P, Pine Grove # XXX  (\u201cthe \nRespondent s\u201d). \n \n2 The present  application  before the Strata Titles Board (\u201cthe Board\u201d)  was filed by Ms \nHena Biswas d/o P Biswa s \u2013 known to the Board as \u201cMrs Roy\u201d  \u2013 for and on behalf of the \nApplicant  in her capacity as the legal donee of the Applicant.  This is Mrs Roy\u2019s second \napplication in respe ct of the water seepage issues in the Applicant\u2019s unit.  \n \n3 The floor plans of the Applicant\u2019s and Respondents\u2019 units are almost identical. However, \nthe floor area of the Applicant\u2019s unit is slightly larger - since the corridor outside the unit Shumona Roy v Tan Meng Yan & anor                      STB No. 48 of 2020 (Pine Grove Condominium)  \nPage 3 of 19 \n was purchased by the Applicant and is presently  an entrance foyer locat ed within  the \nApplicant\u2019s unit. This additional purchased floor area is located right beside the \nApplicant\u2019s kitchen and the common corridor of the fourth floor is located immediately \nabove it.1 \n \n4 The following prayers were listed under \u201c Particulars of Order(s) sought from the Strata \nTitles Board \u201d in the Applicant\u2019s application form dated 7 September 2020:  \n \n\u201c(1) Seeking an order from the Board for the respondent to engage a licensed contractor \nto stop the recurrent seepages from sources pe rmanently.  \n \n(2) Thereafter, to replace / rectify / repair all damages caused to # XXX. \n \n(3) To compensate [for] loss of income (if any) \u201d.2 \n \n5 The water seepage in the Applicant\u2019s unit was first observed in October 2018 at  three (3) \nareas - namely  \u201cthe ceilin g of the bedroom, kitchen and service yard \u201d.3 As the parties \nwere unable to reach a common understanding on how the issue should be resolved  and \nthe condition of the unit continued to worsen, Mrs  Roy filed her first application  (i.e. STB \nNo. 109 of 20 19) in December 2019. 4 \n \n6 The Respondents highlighted that they carried out some works to their unit in September \n2019 (prior to the first application filed by Mrs Roy) on \u201c the presumption of #XXX being \nthe cause of the water damage \u201d, including, inter alia : \n \na) \u201cinstructing [their] contractor to run expose pipes for the whole house \u201d; \n \nb) \u201c[Perform] cement grouting,  \u2026 add a waterproofing membrane and an epoxy paint \nlayer to the Bathroom \u201d; and  \n \nc) \u201cadd a waterproofing memb rane to the area above the # XXX kitchen \u201d.5 \n \n7 Toward s the end of the mediation process , which was facilitated by a different  Board \nconstituted in STB No. 1 09 of 20 19, Mrs Roy found that seepage had ceased  and decided \nto withdraw the application with consent from the Respondents .6  \n \n8 In August 2020, the water seepage issues recurred. The seepage was observed in \u201c the \nkitchen, \u2026 bathroom and dining area \u201d.7 As the parties were once again unable to resolve \nthe issue among themselves, the present application was filed in September 2020 and this \nBoard was constituted to handle the matter.  \n \n9 At the first mediation session before this Board on 20 October 2020, the parties entered \n \n1 Affidavit of evidence -in-chief of Yeoh Cheng Yow (\u201cAW -2\u201d), at p 26.  \n2 Applicant\u2019s Form 8, at p  4. \n3 Affidavit of evidence -in-chief of Hena Biswas d/o P Biswas (\u201cAW -1\u201d), at para 7.  \n4 Id, at paras 8 and 10.  \n5 Affidavit of evidence -in-chief of Tan Meng Yan and Wu Mei Hui Jenny (\u201cRW -1\u201d), at para 4.  \n6 Applicant\u2019s Opening Statement (\u201cAWS\u201d), at para 9.  \n7 AW-1, supra n 3, at paras 14 to 15.

The joint inspection was conducted on 6 November 2020 and 10 \nNovember 2020 and a report dated 24 November 2020 (\u201cthe Joint Report\u201d) was provided \nto the Board and parties. The Joint Report was endorsed by Mr Yeoh Cheng Yow (\u201cMr \nYeoh\u201d), a Chartered Surveyor.  \n \n11 The Joint Report specified that the \u201c site survey was conducted visually,  [in a]  non-\npervasive manner, aided with standard handheld tools, such as Measuring tape, laser \nmeasuring device, Moisture Meter and Camera \u201d. 9 Notably, the  Joint Report highlighted  \nthat: \n \n(a) Although there was \u201c no water leaking observed at the time of inspections \u201d at the \nApplicant\u2019s unit, there was \u201c visible staining, discolouration and residual [sic] \nobserved at the ceiling portion  of the  [kitchen and master bedroom of the Applicant \u2019s \nunit, which are] clear side effects arising from water ingress and leaking through  the \n \n8 AW-1, supra n 3, at p 135.  \n9 AW-2, supra n 1, p 22, at point 1.0.

Having \nstudied  the expert\u2019s report, the Board constituted to resolve  that matter found that there \nwas sufficient evidence that the leak emanated from the Respondents\u2019 unit and ordered \nthe Respondents to perform a water ponding test  to ensure effectiveness of the ir \nrectification works performed  (despite the leak having stopped at the time of the hearing) .  \n \n21 The Applicant\u2019s counsel argues that th e Board\u2019s actions show  \u201cthat the Honourable \n \n15 RW-1, supra n 5, at para 13.  \n16 Id, at para 1.  \n17 Applicant\u2019s Closing Submissions (\u201cACS\u201d), at para 16.  \n18 Poon Meng Jin Dennis v Teo Oh & Tan Thiam Teck [2017] SGSTB 10.

Through the cour se of giving evidence , Mr Yeoh highlighted that : \n \n(a) With regard to the possibility of failed concealed pipes  causing water seepage , there \nmight not necessarily be high water consumption as \u201c if it\u2019s a micro crack, which is \nlike dripping and dripping \u2026 very sm all, it doesn\u2019t represent with a high utility bill \u201d;24  \n \n(b) Concerning  the use of a moisture  meter in the Applicant\u2019s unit but not the \nRespondents\u2019 unit, he \u201c always use [s] the meter in the area of contentious point \u201d and \nsince the matter involved \u201c inter -floor [seepage], because its top down, so it\u2019s natural \nfor [him to use the moisture meter]  in the unit below \u201d;25  \n \n(c) Mr Yeoh  did not do a thermographic test since \u201c a building surveyor does visual \n[inspections]\u2026 only a specialist expert use equipment [relying on] infrared \ntechnology \u201d, and that he had actually recommended doing a thermographic scan in \nthe Joint Report ;26 and \n \n(d) The possibility of a breach in the external wall being cause of the water seepage to \nthe bathroom  of the Applicant\u2019s unit was \u201c very r emote \u201d based on the conditions \nobserved.27    \n \n \n19 AWS , supra n 6, at paras 91 to 93.  \n20 Transcript of 18 February 2021, p 57, at lines 16 to 20.  \n21 AW-1, supra n 3, at p 121  \n22 Transcript of 18 February  2021, p 95, lines 1 to 9.  \n23 Id, p 104, lines 6 to 8.  \n24 Id, p 121, line 20 to p 122, line 2.  \n25 Id, p 129, lines 1 to 15.  \n26 Id, p 130, lines 1 to 9.  \n27 Id, p 140, line 21 to p 141, line 17.

The methodology as to how this can be done varies. \nThe Respondent could, in the extreme, if he so wishes , convert the entire  toilet into a study \nroom to prevent any water leakage. This could solve the problem. However, there is no \nsuggestion th at he will do so .\u201d  \n \n29 On the second day of the hearing, Mr Tan gave evidence on behalf of the Respondents.  \nNotably, Mr Tan highlighted that:  \n \n(a) The rectification works by the Respondent\u2019s contractor \u201c lasted 11 months, because \nit\u2019s during the dry period and th en [the water seepage] happened again because its \nmonsoon season \u2026 our observation [is] that the monsoon water that hit our wall, \nexternal wall, has managed to enter into the applicant\u2019s unit through her defects in \nthe house \u201d; 40 and \n \n(b) With regard to possibility of the Respondents\u2019 tenants showering in the re -purposed \nkitchen of the Respondents\u2019 unit, that \u201c all the tenants cannot shower in cold water \nand they want the heater \u201d 41 and \u201c even if they showered there, the water will not seep \ndown to the appli cant\u2019s unit, because [the Respondents had] already done the \n \n36 Respondents\u2019 Written Submissions (\u201cRWS\u201d), at p 6.  \n37 Id, at pp 7 to 9.  \n38 Id, at p 11.  \n39 Ho Yew Choong Victor/Khew  Cai Jun v Lam Wai Kong Davy [2015] SGSTB 6, at [41(i)] ; RWS, at pp 6 to 7.  \n40 Transcript of 19 February 2021, p 46, lines 17 to 22.  \n41 Id, page 77, lines 8 to 13.

The Respondents \u201c have every intention to convert [their kitchen] into a \npermanent dry area, because [they] have already totally removed all the pipes \nand the water coming to this area \u201d.44 \n \n \nISSUES BEFORE THE BOARD  \n \nPrimary Issues  \n \n30 The Board will first consider whether  the statutory presumption in section 101(8) \nBMSMA  applies in view of the allegations of  the three (3) areas displaying signs of water \ningress/damage in the Applicant\u2019s unit, namely  the kitchen, master bedroom and \nbathroom .45 \n \n31 Where the Board finds that the  presumption is applicable to any area(s) in the Applicant\u2019s \nunit affected by water seepage, the Board will consider whether the Respondents have \nprovided enough evidence to rebut the presumption.  \n \n32 The Board will also consider the status of the Written Agreement entered into by parties \n\u2013 in particular whether it is legally binding on parties and if so, the implications on the \nobligations of parties.  \n \n \nSecondary Issues  \n \n33 The Board notes that Mr Yeoh of Absolute Inspection, who acted as the joint expert for \nparties at the mediation stage, was called as the Applicant\u2019s expert witness at the hearing. \nThe Board further notes that, at Mrs Roy\u2019s request, Mr Yeoh performed a further \ninspection of the Applicant\u2019s unit on 11 January 2021 and issued the Supplementary \nReport on the water seepage issues , and that  the Respondents were not informed of nor \nhad knowledge of both the inspection and the Supplementary Report.   \n \n34 The Board will consider whether these events have affected the objectivity of  Mr Yeoh\u2019s \nprofessional v iews reflected in the Joint Report and the Supplementary Report \n(collectively, \u201cthe Absolute Inspection Reports\u201d) and consequently, whether the Board \nshould disregard the contents of any or all of the Absolute Inspection Reports.  \n \n \n42 Transcript of 19 February 2021, page 77, lines 22 to 24.  \n43 Id, p 80, lines 1 to 3.  \n44 Id, p 80, lines 7 to 9.  \n45 AWS, supra n 6, at para  24.

How ever, the  Board will consider the  status of the Supplementary \nReport . \n \n41 In response to Mr Tan\u2019s queries on this matter during the hearing, Mr Yeoh clarified tha t \nhe told Mrs Roy  that \u201cit is a courtesy to inform \u201d the Respondents about the further \ninspection but emphasized that he was not privy to what was actually communicated to \n \n46 The SiD Reports are referenced in RW -1 and are appended as Appendices I to M -1 of RW -1.  \n47 RCS, supra n 32, at pp 2 to 3.  \n48 Id, at pp 4 to 7.  \n49 RW-1, supra n 5, at para 12.

The person  responsible for the repo rt and video did not present his AEIC to the \nBoard nor did he attend before the Board to be  affirmed or sworn as a witness.  Further, \nthe Board has no information on the background, qualifications and/or experience of this \nperson, and whether or not he is i n a position to give an \u201cexpert\u201d opinion .    \n \n45 It is clear that a Board is not  strictly  bound by the rules of evidence applicable to civil \nproceedings in the courts. Regulation 18(1) of the Building Maintenance and Strata \nManagement (Strata Titles Boards) Regulations 2005 (\u201cBMSMR\u201d) provides that:  \n \n\u201cA Board shall not be bound to apply the rules of evidence applicable to civil proceedings \nin any court but may inform itself on any matter in such manner as it thinks fit. \u201d \n \n46 With that said , the existence of discretion with regard to applying the rules of evidence \ndoes not imply that a Board should wholly disregard such rules  \u2013 especially when the \nattendance of witnesses before the court or tribunal to prove and test their evidence is a \nfundamental tenet of  our dispute resolution regime.  \n \n47 To emphasize the unique position of expert witnesses in a tribunal context, such witnesses \nare \u201cunusual in that they are entitled to give evidence of opinion based on their knowledge \nand experience, wherea s lay witnesses may not give such  opinion evidence and are \nlimited to giving evidence of fact \u201d. 52  \n \n48 Where the evidence sought to be admitted is likely to have material  influence on the \nBoard\u2019s final decision ( e.g. in the case of an expert\u2019s report), the Board is not  inclined to \nallow it to be admitted without the maker present at a hearing  unless such evidence falls \nwithin the trite exceptions to the hearsay rule . This is because the credibility of said \nevidence  would not have been  tested by way of  cross -examination  as well as  further \nclarifications from  the Board  at a hearing , including the questions as to his experience \n \n50 Transcript of 18 February 2021, p 137, lines 2 to 6.  \n51 Id, page 178, at lines 16 to 22.  \n52 Bala Reddy et al, Law and Practice of Tribunals in Singapore (SAL Academy Publishing, 2019), p 127, at    \n6.22.

At the \nhearing, t he parties were clearly instructed that they should not refer  to the contents of \nthe SiD Reports  or the video by Kenn  from that point onward.   \n \n \nReference to the SiD Reports and the New SiD Reports included in the RCS  \n \n51 The Board notes that the Respondents have not heeded the Board\u2019s directions \u2013 \ncontinuing to  refer to the  disregarded  SiD Reports in  their closing submissions  and even \ngoing so far as  to include fresh evidence of inspections and tests done in the RCS without \nleave from the Board.  This is clearly inappropriate; not only is it in breach of the Board\u2019s \ndirections, reference to them in such circumstances will surely be unfair and prejudicial \nto the Applicant, a point which the Applicant\u2019s counsel has made.53    \n \n52 For the same reasons stated in [44] to [49] above,  the Board will wholly disregard  the \nfollowing when coming to a decision on this matter : \n \n(a) The images of the SiD Reports and the New SiD Reports embedded in the RCS;  \n \n(b) Any other images  (e.g. site photographs)  relating to the same embedded in the RCS; \nand \n \n(c) Any textual references to the same  in the RCS.  \n \n \nStatus of the Written Agreement  \n \n53 There is no dispute that the Written Agreement is binding on the parties. The Board refers \nto the second clause of the same , which states:  \n \n\u201cThe parties agree to be irrevocably bound  by the appointed Building Surveyor\u2019s \nfindings as to the leakage, if any, and recommendations for rectifications to be carried \nout.\u201d \n \n[Emphasis added]  \n \n54 It is clear to the Board that the Respondents decided not to abide by the terms of the \nWritten Agreement because the findi ngs in the Joint Report were unfavourable to the \n \n53 This was raised in an urgent letter from the Applicant\u2019s counsel to t he Board (dated 11 March 2021), which was \ncopied to the Respondents, outlining the Applicant\u2019s objections regarding the Respondents\u2019 actions mentioned \nin [51] of this decision.

The Respondents  made  repeated assertions that the Joint Report and/or \nfindings of Mr Yeoh were \u201c wrong \u201d and \u201c flawed \u201d.54 \n \n55 However, the Respondents have not shown nor prov ided any basis for making such \nassertions. The Board notes that the Respondents also assert that their prior rectification \nefforts were effective in preventing water leakage even though the works were done by \nan \u201cunlicensed contractor \u201d.55 \n \n \nApplicability  of the statutory presumption in section 101(8) BMSMA  \n \n56 The law with respect  to the statutory presumption in section 101(8) has been reiterated in \nmultiple past cases before the Boards. This subsection states that:  \n \n\u201c(8) In any proceedings under this section with respect to any alleged defect in a lot or \nin any common property or limited common property situated immediately (whether \nwholly or partly) above another lot or any common property or limited common property, \nit shall be presumed, in the absence of proof to the contrary, that the defect is within \nthat lot or common propert y or limited common property, as the case may be, above if \nthere is any evidence of dampness, moisture or water penetration  \u2014 \n(a) on the ceiling that forms part of the interior of the lot , common property or \nlimited common property, as the case may be, immediately below ; or \n(b) on any finishing material  (including plaster, panel or gypsum board) \nattached, glued, laid or applied to the ceiling  that forms part of the interior \nof the lot , common property or limited common property, as the case may be, \nimmediately below. \u201d \n \n  [Emphases added]   \n \n57 With regard to the kitchen of the Applicant\u2019s unit, the Joint Report highlighted the \npresence  of \u201cvisible staining, discoloration  and residual  [sic] observed \u2026 clear side \neffects arising from water ingress and leaking through the upper floor\u2019s unit\u201d.56 With \nreference to the floor plan 57 and photographs of the staining 58, the Board notes that the \naffected area appears to be directly below the Respondent s\u2019 unit, and not the common \ncorridor.  \n \n58 Similar observations were made by Mr Yeoh with respect to the master bedroom of the \nApplicant\u2019s unit.

At this juncture, t he Board  stresses  that it is limited to making \na final decision based on the evidence  placed  before it , factual and/or expert.  \n \n63 Through the course of the hearing, Mr  Tan has repeated that the waterproofing works \nperformed in the Respondents\u2019 unit were performed by an \u201c unlicensed contractor \u201d who \nis a \u201c very experienced guy \u201d. 64 The Respondents, however, have failed to provide credible \nevidence that the waterproofing work s were indeed performed  and even if performed, \nwhether such works were in accordance with industry standards .  \n \n64 In fact, the Joint Report  does elaborates on the quality of the waterproofing work done in \nthe Respondent\u2019s bathroom, namely that the \u201c existing floor finishes is observed to be \nseverely worn off, with the top coat of epoxy coating damaged at approximately 50% of \nthe bath floor area \u201d, and it was assessed that \u201c the top coating of epoxy coating was \napplied as an adhoc response to mitigate pr evious leaking issue found at the ceiling of \n[the Applicant\u2019s unit]\u201d.65  \n \n65 The Board draws attention to  a piece of testimony given in Tan Toh Ken and anor v Wang \nZheng Ming and anor (\u201cAspen Heights \u201d), another  water seepage matter before a Board .66 \nDuring cross -examination by the Applicant\u2019s counsel at the hearing, one of the \nRespondents conceded that \u201c any reasonable proprietor that wishes to offer evidence to \nrebut the application of the  statutory presumption w ould do so by engaging a water \nseepage specialist to investigate  the issue \u201d.  \n \n \n60 AW-2, supra n 1, at pp  28, 29 and 51.  \n61 Transcript of 18 February 2021, p 169, at lines 9 to 15.  \n62 RCS, supra n 32, at p 16.  \n63 Id, at p 33.  \n64 Transcript of 19 February 2021, p 43, at lines 22 to 24.  \n65 AW-2, p 23, at paras 4.11 to 4.12.  \n66 Tan Toh Ken & Sim Wen Wei Sarah v Wang Zheng Ming & Chong Oi Choo [2018] SGSTB 10, at [13].  Shumona Roy v Tan Meng Yan & anor                      STB No. 48 of 2020 (Pine Grove Condominium)  \nPage 16 of 19 \n 66 Here, the Board notes that both parties have already appointed Mr Yeoh as the joint expert \nand have agreed to be bound by his report, and his report is clear as to his findings and \nrecommendations. The Board is unable to accept the Respondents\u2019 assertions about the \nquality of their experience d \u201cunlicensed contractor\u201d (who was also not called as a \nwitness).  \n \n67 For the reasons stated above, the Board finds that the Respondents have n ot made out \ntheir case and have failed to rebut the statutory presumption.  \n \n \nDuty of the Respondents to identify and rectify the areas within their lot which are causing \nthe water seepage to the Applicant\u2019s unit \n \n68 As the Respondents have failed to rebut the statutory presumption, it follows that  it is the \nRespondents\u2019 duty  to identify and rectify any existing defects in their lot causing water \nseepage to the Applicant\u2019s unit, as well as to rectify any damage to  the Applicant\u2019s  \nproperty stemming  from  the leak.  \n \n69 The Board is of the view that the Respondents have acted on their own terms thus far  - \ncarrying out rectification works in a piecemeal fashion as they saw fit.  \n \n70 The Board notes that there are still areas  left unaddressed by the Respondents.  For \ninstance, Mr Yeoh gave evidence that some of the active pipes in the Respondents\u2019 toilet \nare still concealed and that it is not possible to determine whether these are leaking within \nthe wall cavities.67 The Respondents did not dispute this point during th e hearing or in \ntheir closing submissions.  \n \n71 The Respondents have attempted to use the case of Palmwoods  to argue that they have \nthe right to choose their method of rectification.  However, t he case at hand is different \nfrom Palmwoods  in several  ways . \n \n72 Notably , the Applicants in Palmwoods  did not call any expert witness during the trial  to \ngive evidence regarding the source of the leakage.  The actual cause of the leakage was \nunidentified.  Therefore, the Applicants in that case had no basis  to make a specific  \ndemand that the Respondents should replace the waterproofing membrane in their toilet \n- or any specific method of rectification, for that matter.68 \n \n73 Further,  Palmwoods did not involve a binding written agreement , entered into by the \nparties, for a joint expert to be appointed  to perform a  joint inspection  regarding the water \nseepage issues , document his findings , make recommendations as to how the issue s \nshould be rectified  and that parties agree to be bound by the recommendations . \n \n74 In this scenario, there are grounds for specific rectification methods to be prescribed \nsince:  \n \n(a) The joint expert ( i.e. Mr Yeoh) has assessed the situation on -site and tendered his \nexpert\u2019s opinion and recommendations as to how the water seepage issues  may be \n \n67 Transcript of 18 February 2021, p 177, at lines 2 to 11.  \n68 Palmwoods,  at [41(v)]  Shumona Roy v Tan Meng Yan & anor                      STB No. 48 of 2020 (Pine Grove Condominium)  \nPage 17 of 19 \n rectified ; and  \n \n(b) The Written Agreement imposes a n obligation for parties to adhere to the \nrecommendations  made by the joint expert with respect to  rectification works  to the \nApplicant\u2019s and Respondents\u2019 units.   \n \n75 Accordingly, the Board finds that the Respondents are obligated to perform the \nrectification works to their unit and the Applicant\u2019s unit according to the \nrecomm endations stated in the Joint Report  and as clarified at trial.   \n \n76 On the issue of loss of income in terms of  the \u201cdiscount\u201d of $150 for five (5) months \nrental income  on the Applicant\u2019s part, 69  the Board notes that as the tenant remained in \noccupation and the Applicant relied on a screenshot of a Whatsapp message,70 which \ncontents are unclear, the Board is unable to allow the same .     \n \n77 On the day of the oral decision, the Applicant\u2019s counsel also sought damages and said \nthat despite it not having been sought in the Applicant\u2019s application form ( i.e. Form 8), \nthat the Board should allow the claim  as part of the Board\u2019s discretion to do so . The Board \nis unable to agree as it would be unf air to the Respondents to deal with such a claim so \nlate in the day when it was not sought at the beginning and no inte rlocutory application \nwas made to amend the main application to include this claim.  \n \n78 The Applicant\u2019s counsel also sought indemnity costs against the Respondents and sought \nto convince the Board that this is an exceptional case that would allow for it.71 The Board \nwas unable to agree and as such, standard costs would be appropriate.  \n \n \nBOARD\u2019S DECISION  \n \n79 The Board finds  that the Respondents have not successfully rebutted the statutory \npresumption under section 101(8) of the BMSMA.  \n \n80 This application is allowed.  \n \n81 The Board  orders  that the Respondents  are to , at their own cost : \n \na) Engage a qualified person  to conduct thermogr aphic / thermal imaging infra -red \nscans to  determine the source(s) of water leakage;  \n \nb) Subject to the outcome of  [81(a)] above,  to engage a BCA licensed contractor to \nperform waterproofing works to the areas in the Respondents\u2019 bathroom and \nkitchen highlighted in the Joint Report, in accordance with BCA\u2019s Code of \nPractice , in particular, to hack off the existing flooring and to apply a new water \nproofing membr ane with re -screeding  thereafter;  \n \n \n \n69 AW-1, supra n 3, at para 68    \n70 Id, at p 203.  \n71 See Airtrust (Hong Kong) Ltd v PH Hydraulics & Engineering Pte Ltd [2016] SGHC 167.

The application was first \nfiled with the Board on 22 January 2020.  The Respondent is the subsidiary proprietor of \nthe unit XXX  Jalan Novena Barat Singapore 309610  which is above the Applicant \u2019s unit \n(\u201cthe Respon dent\u201d) and became its registered proprietor on 21 March 2018.  \n \n2 As Mdm Yong passed away on 15 March 2020 , the Board recorded during a direction \nhearing on 12 November 2020 that her application as 2nd applicant was withdrawn. \nFollowing Mdm Yong\u2019s passing, th e Applicant became the only registered proprietor of \nXXX  Jalan Novena Barat and proceeded with the claim as its sole applicant.    \n Wee Hock Chye Patrick  / Yong Oy Cheng @       STB No. 8 of 2020 (Novena Court)  \nYeow Oy Cheng   v Lew Shiaw Lin  \n3 \n 3 The preliminary issue before the Board was whether the Applicant has standing to seek \ncompensatory orders on behalf of his mother\u2019s estate  in the period of time when he was \njoint tenant  with his mother , prior to her passing .     \n \nBACKGROUND  \n \n4 The initial  dispute between the Parties pertained to int er-floor seepage from unit XXX to \nunit XXX . Following a mediation before the Board on 3 April 2020, the parties agreed to \njointly appoint a building surveyor  to determine  the cause of the leak and also agreed to \nbe irrevocably bound by this joint expert\u2019s report.1 \n  \n5 Mr Chin Cheong of Building Appraisal Pte Ltd (BAPL) was duly appointed by the Parties \nand following inspection of both units on 23, 24, 29 and 30  June 2020, BAPL rendered \nthe joint expert\u2019s report in July 2020.  \n \n6 The BAPL report found the Respondent liable for the leak and made recommendations \nfor rectification works  in both units XXX  and XXX . The Board accepts these works were \nremedied by the Respo ndent  in her own unit (XXX ) by 20 October 2020.2 However, none \nof the recommended works in XXX  was carried out by the Respondent.   \n \n7 While the BAPL report resolved liability in respect of the leak itself, the Parties could \nnot come to a resolution regardin g related ancillary matters such as the Applicant\u2019s claims \nfor property damage and loss of rental income. The arbitration hearing on 13 and 14 \nJanuary 2021 thus dealt with these matters.   \n \nORDER SOUGHT  \n \n8 The Applicant  sought an Order from the Board for: \n \n\u201c1. WORK ORDER : Have professional building surveyor determine where the exact \nleak(s) are and have a waterproofing specialist do a ponding test before and after \nto fix / waterproof concrete / leaking AC or water pipes, do a official report to \nconfirm  no more leaks  \n \n2. Compensate me for the time and cost for this application  \n \n3. Loss of rental for the continued leakage rendering our unit lot lettable despite \nmarketing costs and efforts.

And refusing to let them in despite costs already pid  (sic) by claimant ; \n \n5. Repair costs by UEAltraco and others including but not limited to  S$16.500  (sic) \nor such amount to be assessed by STB .\u201d \n \n \n1 Letter from Strata Titles Boards dated 3 August 2020 (File Ref: STB 8 of 2020)  \n2 Respondent\u2019s AEIC paragraph 21 (RW1).  Wee Hock Chye Patrick  / Yong Oy Cheng @       STB No. 8 of 2020 (Novena Court)  \nYeow Oy Cheng   v Lew Shiaw Lin  \n4 \n BOARD\u2019S DECISION ON PRELIMINARY ISSUE  \n \n9 As stated in paragraph 3, a preliminary issue is whether the Applicant has standing to \nseek compensatory orders for loss of rental income claims on behalf of his mother\u2019s estat e \nin the period of time when he was joint tenant with his mother, prior to her passing.  \n \n10 The Board agrees with the Respondent that the Applicant has no standing to seek \ncompensation in this respect. Even if ownership of XXX  vested in the Applicant on 15 \nMarch 2020 upon Mdm Yong\u2019s demise (due to survivorship), th is allow s the Applicant \nto make c laims pertaining to the unit subsequent  to that date . The Applicant has no \nstanding to presently seek claims on behalf of his mother\u2019s estate for the period during \nher lifetime.  \n \n11 In Teo Gim Tiong  v Krishnasamy Pushpavathi (legal representative of the estat e of \nMaran s/o Kannakasabai, deceased)  (\u201cTeo Gim Tiong\u201d) ,3 the Court of Appeal held that \nan estate\u2019s claim for damages required the properly appointed executor or administrator \nof the estate to act for the estate. Chao JA observed that the underlying purpo se of this \nrule is to preserve  the assets of the estate  as \u2018the estate\u2019s worth may be frittered away as \nmuch through the process of litigation as by the commencement of an action.\u2019  Thus, while \nthe alleged losses (rental income and property damage) accrued during Mdm Yong\u2019s \nlifetime and fall within causes of action that survive death pursuant to s 10(1) of the Civil \nLaw Act  (Cap 43), only Mdm Yong\u2019s properly appointed executor or administrator has \nstanding to make these claims on the estate\u2019s behalf.    \n \n12 The Teo Gim Tiong  court noted that its approach is on all fours with the English Court of \nAppeal in Millburn -Snell v Evans4 where Rimer LJ held that \u2018an action commenced by a \nclaimant purportedly as an administrator, when the claimant does not have that ca pacity, \nis a nullity\u2019.5 Chao JA observed that \u2018the obtaining of proper letters of administration is \nnot a mere formality or technicality but a rule conveying substantive rights and as such \nshould not be easily overridden.\u20196 This same principle should also apply where the \ndeceased\u2019s will appoints an executor \u2013 thus the grant of probate gives the executor \nsubstantive rights to act on behalf of the estate.    \n \n13 The Board was presented with the will of Mdm Yong dated 14 December 2014 which \nappoint ed one Kuan Fon g Lin Roxanne  (\u201cRoxanne\u201d) as the sole executor and trustee of \nMdm Yong\u2019s estate. The fact that Roxanne is the Applicant\u2019s wife and Mdm Yong\u2019s \ndaughter -in-law is irrelevant ; the executor alone has standing to seek compensation on \nbehalf of Mdm Yong\u2019s estate . Neither does a letter dated 26 January 2021 (some two \nweeks after the arbitration hearing before the Board) purportedly in the hand of Roxanne \ngiving authorisation to the Applicant cure this defect.  The fact remained that throughout \nthe entire applicatio n before the Board in respect of STB No. 8 of 2020, the executor \nnever acted on behalf of Mdm Yong\u2019s estate following her passing.   \n \n \n3 [2014] 4 SLR 15.  \n4 [2011] EWCA Civ 577.  \n5 Id, at [16]. \n6 [2014] 4 SLR 15 at [32].  Wee Hock Chye Patrick  / Yong Oy Cheng @       STB No. 8 of 2020 (Novena Court)  \nYeow Oy Cheng   v Lew Shiaw Lin  \n5 \n 14 A second related  issue  arises because some of the Applicant\u2019s claims for damaged \nproperty and loss of rent is purportedly in respect of periods before  the Respondent \nbecame the owner of unit XXX . During the proceedings, evidence emerged that the prior \nsubsidiary proprietor of unit XXX  knew about the leak in unit XXX  but appeared to take \nless interest in the same following entering into a contract on 12 December 2017 to sell \nXXX  to the Respondent. As the Applicant  failed to seek compensation from the prior \nowner of XXX , he sought to saddle the Respondent with all claims in relation to his \nalleged losses, even those accruing prior to the Respondent becoming owner of XXX .  \n \n15 In relation to this related preliminary  issue, the Board holds that the Respondent cannot \nbe held liable (if an d when liability is found) for losses accruing before she became legal \nowner. While equitable ownership indeed passed to the Respondent on the date of the \ncontract \u2013 12 December 2017, the nature of this constructive trust is unique. While \nbenefits under a trust ordinarily accrue to the beneficiary, rental income beneficially \nbelongs to the legal owner in the post -contract pre -completion phase. The legal owner \u2019s \nliability includes  paying property tax and  bearing the responsibility for keeping the \npremises sa fe.  \n \n16 The Board thus finds it incongruous if potential losses stemming from ownership (in this \ncase damages resulting from an existing leak) should be attributed to the equitable owner. \nWithout  possession, the Respondent could not have responded to any of the Applicant\u2019s \nclaims  meaningfully . Once legal title of XXX  passed to the Respondent on 21 March \n2018  however , it is clear that the entirety of ownership risk passed to her as part of the \n\u2018bundle of rights\u2019 purchased by the Respondent.      \n \n17 Thus, there are three relevant timelines that the Board takes cognisance of:  \n \n(a) Claims made in relation to periods prior to 21 March 2018 .7  \n(b) Claims made in relation from 21 March 2018 to 15 March 2020 .8 \n(c) Claims made in relation from 16 March 2020 to date of Board\u2019s judgement.9 \n \n18 The Board holds that the Respondent cannot be liable for any losses under timeline 1 7(a). \nAs the Applicant has no standing to make claims on behalf of Mdm Yong\u2019s estate, the \nBoard holds that the Applicant is limited to 50% of the value  of any claims , qua joint \ntenant  of unit XXX , made under timeline 1 7(b). Finally, in relation to any claims made \nunder timeline 1 7(c), the Applicant is entitled to 100% of the value of any losses \nattributable to the Respondent.  \n           \n19 As the Board ultimately found that the Respondent was not liable for loss of rental \nincome, it is noted th at the preliminary issues were not determinative.    \n \nBOARD\u2019S FINDINGS ON SUBSTANTIVE CLAIMS  \n \n20 As stated earlier, the parties have settled the root of the dispute w hich is inter -floor \n \n7 Ie before the Respondent became legal owner of unit XXX .  \n8 From the date the Respondent became legal owner to Mdm Yong\u2019s demise.  \n9 From the date the Applicant became the sole owner of XXX  to the date of judgement.  Wee Hock Chye Patrick  / Yong Oy Cheng @       STB No. 8 of 2020 (Novena Court)  \nYeow Oy Cheng   v Lew Shiaw Lin  \n6 \n seepage from unit XXX  to XXX . The main  orders sought in this application are loss of \nrental income in unit XXX  due to the leak , as well as  property damage. These are \naddressed in turn.  \n \nLoss of Rent  \n \n21 The joint expert report makes it clear that XXX  is liable for the leak . The Board also \naffirms the general principle that where the leak causes the affected unit to be \nunten antable , the proprietors owning the unit causing the leak may be made liable for thi s \nloss of rent.10   \n   \n22 However, the fact that  the Applicant\u2019s unit suffered leakages and that th is stemmed from \nthe Respondent\u2019s unit does not ipso facto  mean that the Respondent is liable for the \nalleged loss of rent. Critically, the Applicant bears the evidentiary burden to prove that \nthe leak  caused unit XXX  to be untena ntable. Where the applicant alleges loss of rental \ncaused by water leakage, it is for  the applicant to show that the extent of the leakage for \nwhich the respondent is liable was severe enough to render the property untenantable: \nCheng Fu Zay  v MCST Plan No 1919 .11 While there is a statutory presumption that the \nunit above caused the leak to  the unit below, the presumption does not go so far as to say \nthat the unit above is also presumed to be liable for all consequential ancillary loss es \nstemming from the leak.  \n \n23 The Applicant\u2019s case for claiming north of $100,000 in loss of rent is premised on him \npartitioning his unit into three areas and renting each one out. Detailed evidence emerged \nduring the hearing (that was accepted even by the Applicant) in this respect include the \nfact that the Applicant exaggerated the size of the three rooms on an  online platform by \nsome 20%  and was seeking to rent the rooms out for about twice the market rent  (on a \nper square foot basis). Evidence also emerged that the layout of the Applicant\u2019s unit is \nmarkedly different from other strata units in the development and further, that the \nApplicant was unable to furnish any relevant local authorities\u2019 approval of the unit \npartitioning .    \n \n24 The Applicant submitted separate tenancy agreements (with different tenants) in respect \nof the three partitioned areas  across different periods of time in attempting to show the \nquantity of the alleged loss. Unfortunately for the Applicant, he was fundamen tally \nunable to provide any  credible evidence that the leak actually caused any areas of unit \nXXX  to be untenantable.  \n \n25 Apart from the Applicant, only one witness gave evidence on behalf of the Applicant. \nAW2  Tham Yin Teng \u2019s (\u201cTham\u201d) AEIC states that Mdm Yo ng permitted Tham to \nterminate the tenancy after signing the tenancy agreement but before moving in. The \nApplicant also gave evidence that the poor conditions in the unit (which he alleges stems \nfrom the leak) resulted in tenants who had rented other parts  of unit XXX  to terminate \nthe lease.  According to the Applicant, this means that the Respondent should compensate \nthe Applicant for the loss of rental income.   \n \n10 See for eg STB No 32 of 2018 \u2013 Poh Beng Swee v Teo Siew Yam  (\u201cLoyang Valley\u201d).  \n11 [2008] 3 SLR(R) 328.  Wee Hock Chye Patrick  / Yong Oy Cheng @       STB No. 8 of 2020 (Novena Court)  \nYeow Oy Cheng   v Lew Shiaw Lin  \n7 \n 26 There is an important distinction between a unit being untenantable in that no reasonable \ntenan t would be expected to start commencing a lease with the situation where a currently \ntenanted unit starts leaking and the tenant wants to breach the contract. As there are no \nstatutory habitability laws in Singapore, the state of the unit and the price to be paid in \nexchange for the space is a market transaction between landlord and tenant.  \n \n27 The Board finds that the Respondent should not be found liable for the loss of rental \nincome. The Applicant has not proved that the leak caused XXX  to be untenantabl e and \nin any case, the Applicant has failed to mitigate his losses . \n \n28 As a chattel real, a lease is a hybrid of contract and an estate in land . The applicability of \nspecific performance to the latter means that generally speaking, both landlord and tenant \nare bound under the lease for the period of the tenancy. Strictly speaking, t here i s no \nobligation on the part of the landlord to allow the tenant to terminate the lease due to a \nleak, unless the tenancy agreement specifies so. Damage arising during the course of a \ntenancy typically results in shared responsibility between landlord and t enant in terms of \napportionment.  The mere fact that the tenants may have told the Applicant (or his mother \nMdm Yong) that they want to determine the lease does not mean that the unit has become \nuntenantable  because  of the leak.  \n \n29 In Cheng Fu Zay  v MCST Plan  No 1919 ,12 Woo J cited with approval : \n \n\u2018In my opinion, the key issue is whether the extent of the leakage was severe enough to \nrender the units untenantable. If the leakage had some impact, then the degree had to be \nassessed. If the leakage was part of a whole host of factors rendering the unit \nuntenantable, then the contribution it played towards that result had to be assessed. \u2019 \n \n30 On the facts, the Applicant has not shown the extent of the leakage was severe enough to \nrender XXX  untenantable.     \n \n31 A leakin g ceiling per se is also very unlikely to amount to a frustrating event. While the \nHouse of Lords has recognised that the doctrine of frustration can i n principle apply to \nleases, its application at common law is extremely reticent. In National Carriers Lt d v \nPanalpina (Northern) Ltd  (\u201cNational Carriers\u201d) ,13 the issue before the Lords was the \ntwenty -month closure, by the local council, of the only vehicular access to a tenanted \nwarehouse. As the warehouse was unusable for the twenty -month period due to the lack \nof access, the tenant of the ten -year lease stopped paying rent, declaring the lease \nfrustrated and hence discharged. While a majority of the court held that frustration could \napply to leases in principle, the facts at hand were insufficient for the doctrine to apply \ngiven the remaining length of the lease, some three years, after th e supervening \ninterruption. The twenty -months of rent was thus held to be due and payable to the \nlandlord even though the tenant could not use the property for the period in question.   \n \n32 The nature of the intervention in National Carriers  is more severe than the leak described \nby the Applicant. The Board thus notes that the Applicant\u2019s (or Mdm Yong\u2019s) decision \n \n12 [2008] 3 SLR(R) 328 at [2 4]. \n13 [1981] AC 675.  Wee Hock Chye Patrick  / Yong Oy Cheng @       STB No. 8 of 2020 (Novena Court)  \nYeow Oy Cheng   v Lew Shiaw Lin  \n8 \n to allow their tenants to determine their leases may not have been legally required, being \nakin to a mutual surrender. Thus, a bsent an explicit term in the contract (which the Board \ndid not observe in any of the leases presented by the Applicant), the Applicant was not \nobliged to permit the termination of any tenancy agreement on the part of the tenants.  \n \n33 The Applicant has  not discharged its evidentiary burden to prove that XXX  became \nuntenantable due to the leak,  and in any case  the Board finds that the Applicant has failed \nto mitigate his own losses as he is required to do: Tan Soo Leng David  v Lim Thian Chai \nCharles .14 As a policy meant to reduce wasteful  activity , the failure of the Applicant to \nmitigate his own losses is a further bar against holding the Respondent liable for the loss \nof rental claim.   \n \n34 From one perspective, permitting the tenants in question to term inate the lease when he \nwas not legally required to do so may be seen as a failure to mitigate his losses. That \naside, the Board finds that the Applicant has failed to mitigate his losses because he has \nfailed to make repairs / restoration work in XXX  to cover up the discolourations he claims \nemanates from XXX  (and which he could have claimed from the Respondent \nsubsequently) and further, that the Applicant has not sufficiently tried to  have XXX  \ntenanted. The latter requires some further explanation.   \n \n35 While there was evidence given by the Applicant that the unit continues to be untenanted \ntill today, the Board notes that the Applicant has persisted in seeking to have XXX  \npartitioned and rented out as three separate areas at a rate of more than twice the market \nprice (the Board notes the market rate for the development to be approximately $3 per \nsquare foot per month).  In this respect, the Applicant has failed to mitigate his losses \u2013 a \nreasonable landlord would have sought to rent the property a t a reason able rate, even if \nthis means renting it out  as a single unit (and if there is leakage  or discolouration  as \nclaimed by the Applicant), to further reduce the rent to below  market rate.  \n \n36 For instance, if the market price for the size of the Applicant\u2019s unit (850 square feet) was \n$2550 per month ,15 a tenant would perhaps have been willing to rent XXX  at $1500 or \n$2000 per month. This would have been strong  evidence to show the Board that the \nApplicant had to lower his expectations because of the unsavoury state of the property \nwhich the Applicant claims was caused by the Respondent.  Instead, the combined rent \nthat the Applicant was seeking as seen from his advertisements was in the range of $6000 \nper month16 as he persisted in seeking to rent out t he unit as three partitioned areas  (and \nat an assumed 100% occupancy) . Even discounting the Respondent\u2019s submissions that \nthe Board should not permit alleged illegality on the part of the Applicant in partitioning  \nXXX , the Board finds that the Applicant\u2019s conduct in seeking an unrealistic rent in the \n \n14 [1998] 1 SLR(R) 8 80. \n15 850 square feet multiplied by $3.  \n16 During the hearing evidence emerged from online property advertisements (99.co) that the Applicant was \nseeking to rent the portioned areas in XXX  as follows: Master bedroom (coloured blue on Annex F) at \n$1600/month , the \u2018studio\u2019 unit listed a \u201cstudio condo in the listing\u201d (coloured green on Annex F) at $2000/month \nand a \u20181 -bedroom condo\u2019 (coloured orange on Annex F) at $2400 per month for a 2 -year lease. The advertisements \noffered a lower rate where the entire rent was paid upfront and a higher rate when the lease was for a 1 -year period. \nWhile the advertised property belongs to the Applicant, the Board notes that the advertisement does not state that \nthe Applicant was listing his own property.       Wee Hock Chye Patrick  / Yong Oy Cheng @       STB No. 8 of 2020 (Novena Court)  \nYeow Oy Cheng   v Lew Shiaw Lin  \n9 \n circumstances shows that he has failed to mitigate his own losses ; the Applicant\u2019s  high \nexpectations may have contributed to the Applicant being unable to find tenants. This \nreinforces the Board\u2019s findings that  the Applicant is unable to prove that a cause  for the \nloss of rental income stemmed from the Respondent\u2019s unit (and not perhaps, because the \nrent sought by the Applicant was too high).         \n \n37 Perplexingly, the Applicant\u2019s advertisements (including photographs) represent that the \nentirety of unit XXX  is in an excellent condition.  For instance, the advertisement for the \n\u201cstudio unit\u201d describes the property as \u201calmost brand -new designer studio.\u201d These \nadvertise ments were placed by the Respondent in his capacity as a registered salesperson \nto the general public  in the 99.co platform . This is diametrically opposed with the \nApplicant\u2019s claims before the Board  that the Respondent had caused significant harm to \nthe tenantability of XXX .  \n  \n38 As there is no credible evidence which shows that the leak in XXX  (stemming from \nXXX ) actually caused  any loss of rental income to the Applicant, and that in any case, \nthe Applicant has failed to mitigate his loss, the Board dismisses the Applicant\u2019s claims \nfor loss of rent in its entirety.           \n \nProperty Damage  \n \n39 The Applicant seeks approximately $35,000 from the Respondent for certain remedial  \nworks and property damage.  \n  \n40 In relation to the claim for $16,500 (UE Altraco Quotation dated 10 April 2018), the \nBoard finds that there is no evidentiary nexus between the leak caused by the Respondent \nand the works on the sink and wardrobe. While that quote also included costs for \nsupplying labour and materials in respect of XXX \u2019s ceiling, the Board notes that this was \nin relation to waterproofing membrane in respect of the Applicant\u2019s own ceiling. \nAccordingly, this claim is dismissed.  \n \n41 In respect of the claim for the washing machine  ($899) and a dehumidifier ($1200), this \nis also dismissed. The Applicant did not provide any evidence that the washing machine \nwas spoilt by the Respondent\u2019s unit. Indeed,  Lim Hiong Kwang , a licensed electrician \ngave evidence before the Board that in his view, it was unlikely that the Respondent\u2019s \nunit caused the Applicant\u2019s washing machine to spoil. In respect of the claim for the \ndehumidifier, this appears to be based on the joint expert\u2019s recommendation to use a \ndehumidifier inside the rooms to remove a ny excess moisture. The jointly appointed \nexpert did not recommend that a dehumidifier was permanently needed . Indeed , the use \nof the humidifier is part of the $13,900 claim dealt with in the next paragraph.   \n \n42 In respect of the  Applicant\u2019s claim for $1 6,900 ($13,900 excluding the claim for the \nmirrors as per the UE Altraco Quotation dated 30 June 2020), the Board finds that the \nquote goes beyond what is recommended in the joint expert report. The Respondent has \nobtained a quotation of $3,600 (Aaron Au\u2019s quote dated 1 December  2020) as being \nsufficient to carry out  the necessary rectification works. As the Respondent does not \ndispute that she is to adhere with the joint expert\u2019s report, the issue for the Board in \nrespect of this claim is one of quantification. The Board notes that the joint expert has Wee Hock Chye Patrick  / Yong Oy Cheng @       STB No. 8 of 2020 (Novena Court)  \nYeow Oy Cheng   v Lew Shiaw Lin  \n10 \n estimated that  the cost of works in XXX  is $10,000 (paragraph 5.10 of BAPL Report). \nThere is no reason to disturb the finding of the neutral joint expert in this respect and the \nBoard thus finds the Respondent liable to pay the Applicant $10,000.  While this may \nappear t o slightly overcompensate the Applicant (as the Respondent has done some touch \nup to the ceiling of XXX ), the Board also notes that the touch up to the ceiling would in \nany case have to be redone when the underlying ceiling works are done to XXX .  \n \nOther c laims  \n \n43 Finally, t he Board dismisses the  Applicant\u2019s prayer for loss of time as there is no legal \nbasis for such a claim. The Board also dismisses the application for a further work order  \nas this was not recommended by the joint expert which the  parties had  agreed to be bound \nby. \n \nBOARD\u2019S DECISION  \n \n44 The Board hereby finds that the Respondent is liable to pay the Applicant $10,000  being \nthe costs of rectification works  to the Applicant\u2019s unit as concluded by BAPL  in its report \nin July 2020 . \n \n45 In addition to paragraph [44] above, the  Board after hearing the parties on costs, make s \nthe following order:  \n \na. The Respondent to pay the Applicant the sum of $2,675 for the costs of the \nBAPL report in July 2020;  \n \nb. The Respondent to reimburse the Applicant the filing fee of $500 and the fee for \nthe 3rd mediation / direction hearing on 13 August 2020 of $150;  \n \nc. The Applicant to pay the Strata Titles Boards fees of $1,500 for attendances and \narbitration hearings before the Board;  \n \nd. The Applicant to pay to the Respondent costs of $5,000  being costs for the 2-day \nhearing in respect of assessment of damages ; and  \n \ne.

The Respondent does not deny that following from the Applicant\u2019s complaint that there \nwas sharing of IDs and passwords for tennis court bookings, it had emailed residents to \ninform that their passwords had been cancelled to prevent their accounts from bein g \nmisused to make the tennis court bookings.12  The Respo ndent states that s ince then, t here \nhad been no breaches on the tennis court booking .13 With regard to the prohibition of non -\nresidential students/parents from entering into the condominium to attend tennis lessons, \nit is the Respondent\u2019s case t hat the Board does not have the jurisdiction to enforce any \nprohibition on commercial coaching  in the absence of a by -law being passed by special \nresolution  on such prohibition under Section 101(6) of the  Act. 14 \n \n10. The Respondent submits that there are \u201c2-3 free roaming cats\u201d in the condominium 15 \nand that it is not disputed that various steps had been taken by the Respondent to  address \nthe Applicant\u2019s concerns about these cats by meeting with a mediator from the Cat \nWelfare Society  (\u201cCWS\u201d)  and putting the cats up for adoption . However, the Respondent \nclaims that the Applicant was resistant to the proposed solutions by the CWS and the cat s \nhad not been adopted  (i.e. to park her car on the 3rd or  4th level of the multi -storey carpark) . \n16 \n \n11. The Respondent also de nies any liability for any damage to the Applicant\u2019s vehicle, and \nstates that there is no basis for the Respondent to seek an indemnity from the Respondent \nand/or any other third party in this regard.17  The Respondent take s the position that the \nApplicant has not furnished any evidence showing the cats scratching the top of her car \nand/or that the scratches were indeed caused by the cats18, there ha s been no failure on \ntheir part to exercise or perform a power, duty or function conferred or imposed by the \n \n12 Respondent\u2019s Written Submission  (\u201cRWS\u201d)  dated 24 December 2020 at paragraph [10].  \n13 RWS  dated 24 December 2020 at paragraph [14].  \n14 RWS  dated 24 D ecember 2020 at paragraphs [21] and [22].  \n15 RWS  dated 24 December 2020 at paragraph [23].  \n16 RWS  dated 24 December 2020 at paragraphs [28] and [29].  \n17 RWS  dated 24 December 2020 at paragraph [49].  \n18 RWS  dated 24 December 2020 at paragraph [39].

The Respondent also takes the view  that the signs prominently placed throughout the car \npark is effective in exempting their liability vis -\u00e0-vis the damage. The signs state  21:  \n \n\u201cThe Management will not be held responsible for any damage, loss, theft or \nmisde meanour occurring whilst the vehicles are parked in the premises. All vehicles \nare parked strictly at the owner\u2019s risk .\u201d \n \nBoard\u2019s Findings  \n \nOn the use of tennis courts  \n \n13. During the cross examination of the condominium manager, Ms Catherine Lim Siew Eng \n(\u201cthe condominium manager \u201d), with respect to two (2) incidents of breaches to the use of \ntennis courts reported by the Applicant on 19 September 2020 22 and 21 February 2020 \n23, the condominium manager  had admitted that it would not be possible for the \nRespondent to confirm / tell the person(s) actually using the tennis courts during the period \nfor which the tennis courts were booked. The condominium manager  and/or the \ncondominium\u2019s security guard(s) wo uld randomly check the users of the tennis courts \nand/or when complaints were raised in relation to the enforcement of the supplementary \nby-laws on the use of the tennis courts.  \n \n14. At the hearing, the Respondent took the position that commercial coaching was  allowed \nin the absence in its supplementary by -law on the use of tennis court for commercial \ncoaching purpose. However, when cross examined, the condominium manager  \nacknowledged there was a notice to the security guards to prohibit non -residents from \nentry into the condominium for tennis coaching, which notice states:  \n \n \u201cThe Management Corporation has alerted all security guards DO NOT \nALLOW entry to non -residential tennis students/parents into Astoria Park to \nattend their tennis lessons.  \n \n \n19 RWS  dated 24 December 2020 at paragraph [40]  \n20 RWS  dated 24 December 2020 at paragraph [41].  \n21 RWS  dated 24 December 2020 at paragraph [42].  \n22 AEIC of Catherine Lim Siew Eng  dated 17 December 2020 at p p 27 and 36. \n23 AEIC of Catherine Lim Siew Eng dated 17 December 2020 at p 17.  Chang Quan Yin Elizabeth Ann v The    STB No. 37 of 20 20 (Astoria Park)  \nMCST Plan No. 2120    \n \n12 \n \u2026: attention to all security officers at main guard entrance. \u201cDO NOT ALLOW \nANY VISITORS TENNIS STUDENTS / PARENTS TO ATTEND TENNIS \nCOACHING\u201d. If any doubt, security is to contact the Management \nCorporation .\u201d 24 \n \n15. Given the above,  the  Board finds  that the supplementary by -laws with respect  to the u se \nof the tennis courts  had been breached (i.e. monitoring was randomly conducted by the \nRespondent, and the Respondent failed to  reasonably ensure that the person who booked \nthe tennis court was present at the c ourt during the booking period) .   \n \n16. Notwithstanding the Respondent\u2019s claims that there have been \u201c continued efforts on the \nRespondent\u2019s part to actively monitor and scrutinize the bookings made by the \nresidents \u201d25, the Board is not convinced by the evidence  adduced by the Respondent at \nthe hearing that there have been in fact been such efforts actively on the ground.  For \nexample, the letter that the condominium manager said had been sent to residents on the \ncancellation of their passwords for the mobile app lication for the booking of tennis courts \n(to prevent misuse by non -residents) in fact had only been set to 3 residents .26   \n \n17. In this regard, the Board is of the view that the management council should at least take \nreasonable steps to ensure that the by -laws are complied with and conclude that the \nRespondent in this case had failed to take reasonable steps.  Further, t here is no \nsatisfactory evidence before the Board to show that these breaches would not continue.  \n \n18. The Board  therefore  makes an order pursuant to section 101(1)(c) of the Act, for the \nCouncil of the MCST (\u201cthe Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 2120\u201d) to \nenforce the  supplementary  by-laws on the \u201cUse of Recreational Facilities by Guests \u201d and \nthe \u201c Use of Tennis Courts\u201d and on that point , prayer (1) of the Applicant\u2019s application is \nallowed.    \n \n19. The Board is  unable to make an order for enforcement in relation to the Applicant\u2019s \nprayer s for  the suspension of resident\u2019s account when he / she is caught sharing user ID \nand passwords  as that would be overly -prescriptive and intruding into the decision -\nmaking choices of the MCST as to how the by -laws are to be enforced.   \n \n20. On the issue of the use of the tennis courts for commercial coaching, the Board makes the \nfollowing ob servations.  \n \n24 AEIC of Catherine Lim Siew Eng dated 17 December 2020 at p 18.  \n25 Respondent\u2019s Closing Submission s dated 26 January 2021 at paragraphs [12] -[16].  \n26 Transcript for hearing on 5 January 202 1 Page 6 Line 11 to Page 9 Line 11.  Chang Quan Yin Elizabeth Ann v The    STB No. 37 of 20 20 (Astoria Park)  \nMCST Plan No. 2120    \n \n13 \n  \n21. Paragraph [7.1] of Part 1 of Supplementary By -Laws provides that \u201c A Subsidiary \nProprietor or occupier of a lot shall not be permitted to engage in any game or activity in \nor about other than those for which the recreational facilities are desi gned or for the \npurpose deem fit by the council .\u201d At least as of February 2020, the Respondent appeared \nto have taken the position that \u201c RESIDENTS SHOULDN\u2019T COMBINE THEIR BOOKING \nSLOTS AND UTILIZE THE SLOTS TOGETHER FOR COACHING \u201d27. When asked \nabout why the reference to \u201cFOR COACHING\u201d was removed during the hearing, the \nRespondent was unable to confirm that there was a council meeting or decision on this \npoint . \n \n22. The Board  notes that the Management Council and/or its Managing Agent asserts  that \nwhat is not prohibited  by the by -laws is deemed allowed, based on the evidence at the \nhearing:  \n \n(a) Evidence by the Respondent\u2019s lawyer:  \n \n\u201cDeputy President:  I think Ms Chang mentioned it earlier.  If you see page 45, \nit says - -  the caps, right:  \n PLEASE \u2013 \u201cNOTE\u2026RESIDENTS SHOULDN\u2019T \nCOMBI NE THEIR BOOKING SLOTS AND UTILISE THE \nSLOTS TOGETHER FOR COACHING.\u201d  \n Yes, so this is in February  2020.  So the board would just \nlike you to c larify your client\u2019s position on this issue of \ncommercial coaching.  Is this a breach or note of your \nbylaws? And, you know, then maybe just explain those two \ndocuments.  \nMr Gokul:  Sure. Thank you, your Honor.  In respect of the first query \nwhether - - in respect of Catherine\u2019s email, coaching for a \ncommercial purpose.  Because it falls under the heading of \nbreach of bylaws, so a natural meaning to it meaning it\u2019s a \nbreach.  The reason why this was set out as a breach was, \nat first, they took the position th at there was a breach.  \nHowever, it was pointed out by the coaches that the bylaws \nare silent and, thereafter, the position which the MCST has \ntaken, there were - - there are no breaches.\u201d 28 \n \n(b) Evidence by Mr Soh Goon Chuan, Council Member : \n \n \n27 AEIC of Chang Quan Yin Elizabeth dated 17 December 2020 at Tab B.  \n28 Transcript of 4 January 202 1 at Page 46 Line 1 to Line 20.  Chang Quan Yin Elizabeth Ann v The    STB No. 37 of 20 20 (Astoria Park)  \nMCST Plan No. 2120    \n \n14 \n \u201cDeputy President:  Mr Soh, there was one point that earlier we tried to engage \nyour (counsel) on.  And which is the cou ncil\u2019s \nunderstanding that your by -laws do not prohibit \ncommercial coaching, right, for \u2013 at least for tennis or it \u2013 \nA.    It\u2019s silent  \n\u2026 \nDeputy President:  -- does not prohibit commercial coaching for any use of the \nrecreational facilities in Astoria Park?  \nA. I think by -law only for - - like for example, karaoke all these, \nthey had no commercial value.  But for tennis court, they \ndidn\u2019t mention  any.  Because by -law is set up by the \ndeveloper, the first management. So we just follow the by -\nlaw. \nSo we may have to, what you call, to prevent commercial \nvalue, we have to prevent commercial value, we have to put \nup a motion, the next AGM, then it can make it become a \nby-law. We need AGM. But right now, there is no by -law \nsaying that you cannot do commercial for tennis court, \nyah.\u201d 29 \n \n(c) Evidence by Catherine Lim Siew Eng, condominium manager:  \n \n\u201cQ This is what you said was emailed out. So can I draw your \nattention to the middle section, \u201cBreach of by -laws \u2013 terms \nand conditions in Hi -Life booking facility\u201d.  Do you confirm \nthat it\u2019s written there, number \u201c(1) coaching for \ncommercial purposes\u201d; and number \u201c(6) prohibition of \ncombining booking slot s and utilising it for coaching \nbreached\u201d\u2026.  \nA Yah. \nQ. -- is this what is stated here? Yes or no?  \nA. This breach of by -law is given by the applicant, right.  She \nhas given me this breach of by -law, and so I began to share \nwith the resident that they are not  supposed to breach the \nby-law.  And basically, they are supposed to follow.  But \nlater on, in our by -law, it says that the commercial coaching \nis silent.\u201d 30 \n \n\u201cQ. Okay. I put it to you that therefore, it has been the position \nof the MCST and its management  that tennis \u2013 commercial \ntennis coaching was not allowed, based on what I have said \njust now.  I am not talking about what has been the MCST\u2019s \n \n29 Transcript of 4 January 2021 at page 1 76 Line 3 to Line 25.  \n30 Transcript of 5 January 2021 at page 4 3 Line 4 to Line 23.  Chang Quan Yin Elizabeth Ann v The    STB No. 37 of 20 20 (Astoria Park)  \nMCST Plan No. 2120    \n \n15 \n and man agement\u2019s position on commercial tennis coaching.  \nYour position has been that it\u2019s not allowed.  \nA, Right . \nQ. Correct, agree?  \nA. Yes. \nQ.  Agree.  \nA. But we have in the by -law, after reading, we know that \ncoaching was silent.  So this was put up due to the \napplicant\u2019s request.  So I based on the applicant\u2019s request \nand that\u2019s why I put it up in this manner, but  actually, it is \nnot right to have this to be up.  Commercial has nothin g to \nmention, so it\u2019s allowed actually. Commercial activity is \nallowed  \nQ. So you are saying that because it is silent, by -laws are silent \non coaching, so it is allowed?  \nA. Right.\u201d31 \n \n23. In particular, the Board wishes to hig hlight sections 32(1), 32(2) and 32(3) of the Act, \nwhich state as follows:  \n \n\u201cBy-laws for common property  \n \n32(1) Every parcel comprised in a strata title plan shall be regulated by by -laws.  \n \n(2) Subject to the  Fourth Schedule, the by -laws prescribed by regulations shall \nbe the by -laws for every parcel comprised in a strata title plan in respect of which \na management corporation is constituted on or after 1st April 2005, and no by -\nlaw made under this section or section 33 shall be inconsistent with any such \nprescribed by -law. \n \n(3) Save where otherwise provided in section 33, a management corporation \nmay, pursuant to a special resolution, make by -laws, or amend , add to or repeal \nany by -laws made  under this section, for the purpose of controlling and \nmanaging the use or enjoyment of the parcel comprised in the strata title plan, \nincluding all or any of the following purposes:  \n \n  (a) safety and security measures;  \n  (b) details of any common property of which the use is restricted;  \n  (c) the keeping of pets;  \n \n31 Transcript of 5 January 2021 at Page 5 1 Line 13 to Page 5 2 Line 8.  Chang Quan Yin Elizabeth Ann v The    STB No. 37 of 20 20 (Astoria Park)  \nMCST Plan No. 2120    \n \n16 \n   (d) parking;  \n  (e) floor coverings;  \n  (f) garbage disposal;  \n  (g)_ behaviour;  \n(h) architectural and landscaping guidelines to be observed by all subsidiary \nproprietors;  \n(i)    such other matters as are appropriate to the type of strata scheme           \nconcerned . \n \n24. The Board notes that Astoria Park is a purely residential  development without commercial \nlots.  Section 32(1) when read together with section 32(3)(i) of the Act indicate that the \nuse of a recreational amenity in a condominium like Astoria Park must be congruent  and \nappropriate to the approved residential strata  scheme.  Regulation 19(1)(a) of Regulations \n2005 relied on by the Respondent to argue that commercial activities may be conducted \non common property since a special resolution is only required to limit it to specified \ntimes, must be read subject to the Ac t, and the type and nature of the strata development.  \nTherefore, a special resolution may be passed by Astoria Park\u2019s subsidiary proprietors so \nthat commercial activities may be conducted during specified times, if the MCST \nconsiders it appropriate for th e control, management, administration, use or enjoyment of \nthe tennis courts. The Board is therefore of the view that allowing commercial tennis \ncoaching to residents and non -residents in Astoria Park would require a by -law to permit \nand regulate such a us e. Section 32(3) of the Act provides that such a by -law is to be \npassed as a special resolution and the words \u201c for the purpose of controlling and managing \nthe use or enjoyment of the parcel \u201d are particularly instructive , and Regulation 19(1)(a) \nof Regulati ons 2005 is consistent with it.  \n \nOn the presence of three ( 3) cats roaming  in the development  \n \n25. There is common ground that both parties refer to the same  three  (3) cats.  During her \ncross examination, the condominium manager informed the Board that \u201cUncle Daud\u201d, the \nestate\u2019s gardener, had been feeding and caring for the cats in the development.  A warning \nletter had been sent to Uncle Daud\u2019s employer, Prince\u2019s Landscape Pte Ltd, on 11 August \n2020 that the \u201cvendor\u2019s cats  must be removed from Astoria Park basement. \u201d 32 At \nparagraph [22] of her AEIC, the condominium manager testified \u201c the vendor\u2019s email reply \ndated 12 August 2020 denying ownership of the cat \u201d but gave no evidence of such an \nemail reply.  During her re -examination, the condominium manager testified that the cats \n \n32 AEIC of Catherine Lim Siew Eng dated 17 December 2020 at p 46.  Chang Quan Yin Elizabeth Ann v The    STB No. 37 of 20 20 (Astoria Park)  \nMCST Plan No. 2120    \n \n17 \n may also belong to an owner in the condominium who had passed away 33 but evidence \nof the cats\u2019 previous ownership was not traversed  before the Board.  The three  (3) cats are \ncared f or and kept by \u201cUncle Daud\u201d, the Respondent\u2019s gardener, rendering him effectively \nadopting the cats . \n \n26. In Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 3250 v Yan Wen Ting  [2017] SGDC \n175 (\u201c Yan Wen Ting \u201d), the plaintiff was a management corporation that file d a suit against \nthe defendant who was an occupier of a unit in the residential development.  In its \napplication, the plaintiff sought a mandatory injunct ion to remove the  defendant\u2019s dog \nfrom the said unit. In finding whether the Court should grant a mandatory injunction, it \nwas held at paragraph [41] of Yan Wen Ting  that: \n \n\u201c\u2026the court will grant a mandatory injunction to redress a breach of a negative \ncovenant, the breach of which is already accomplished unless \u2013 \n \n(a) the plaintiff\u2019s own conduct would make it unjust to do so; or  \n  \n (b) the breach was trivial or had caused no appreciable damage to the plaintiff and \na mandatory injunction would impose substantial hardship on the defendant with \nno counter -balancing benefit to the plaintiff.\u201d  \n \n27. The District Court in Yan Wen Ting  found  that granting a mandatory injunction to remove \nthe defendant\u2019s dog from the said unit would be disproportionate to the complaints made \nby the plaintiff  about the defendant\u2019s dog.  T he plaintiff \u2019s complaints  were  based entirely \non the complaints made by a family residing in the estate . Further, i t was motivated by \nacrimony between the two neighbours and lacked objectivity.  The Court found that the \nplaintiff and the family did not suffer an appreciable damage as the family\u2019s encounters \nwith the dog were occ asional, and the defendant had taken steps to improve the situation \n(see paragraphs [42] to [44] of Yan Wen Ting ).    \n \n28. In the present case, t he factors in favour of the grant of an injunction are as follows:  \n \n(a) Based on the evidence adduced before the Board by way of photographs of the \nApplicant\u2019s car and during the inspection thereof conducted by the Board on 5 \nJanuary 2021, the Board is satisfied that the damage was done by the cats as stated \nin the Application ; \n \n \n33 AEIC of Catherine Lim Siew Eng dated 17 December 2020 at paragraph [22].  Chang Quan Yin Elizabeth Ann v The    STB No. 37 of 20 20 (Astoria Park)  \nMCST Plan No. 2120    \n \n18 \n (b) There was  at least  another incident of cats causing scratches on the \u201c top of cars and \nhave caused scratches to the car surface\u201d on or about 12 January 2018; 34 and \n \n(c) The Board finds that the p roposals by the Respondent and/or CWS for the Applicant \nto put cat spike mats (cats have jumped onto the cat spike mats  35), to use cat \nrepellent spray  (this had  to be applied every 2 -3 hours  and leave the Applicant\u2019s car \nsticky and dirty after each application ) and to park at other levels of the carpa rk and \nthe surface carpark, and not at the basement car park   are not effective, and do es \nnot prevent the three (3) cats from damaging / causing further damage the \nApplicant\u2019s car . For example, there is evidence of the cats at other carpark levels \nbesides  the basement car park 36 , with no relief to the Applicant\u2019s car.  \n \n29. There are 2 other points the Board would observe.  \n \n(a) There were 42 signatures out of 354 units or 360 units (11%) in the development \n37 to petition to \u201cLEAVE THE CATS WHERE THEY ARE\u201d.  The Board is \nfocused on the application before it which is whether the MCST has exercised \nand/or performed its powers and/or duties in accordance with the law. The Board \nwould not suggest that any MCST exercises and/or performs its duties influenced \nby or based on petitions, especially where the council has been duly elected or \nempowered by the general body at an Annual General Meeting.  \n \n(b) The CWS mediator, Safiah Bte Mohamed Basir, testified that if the three (3) cats \nare removed from the condominium the surrounding area of the condominium \nhave known cases of unsterilized cats and \u201c\u2026 there is a possibility of the said \ncats taki ng up an empty territory once inhabited by the cats \u201d.   However, as the \nBoard finds that there is a failure to exercise or perform its powers or duties in \naccordance to the law by the MCST, the Board will have to make the necessary \norder(s) in this regard.   Furthermore , there is a possibility that the further damage \nto the Applicant\u2019s car cannot be prevented in the future if the removal of the said \nthree (3) cats in question  is not ordered . \n \n30. Further, pursuant to the section 33 of the Act, the condominium is regulated by the by -\nlaws, inter alia, Regulation 14 of Regulations 2005 .  \u201cUncle Daud \u201d is not a subsidiary \nproprietor or an occupier and it would be absurd if the law allowed him to keep and care \nfor the cats in the condominium and for his cats to roam freely at the common property \n \n34 AEIC of Catherine Lim Siew Eng dated 17 December 2020 at p 39.  \n35 AEIC of Chang Quan Yin Elizabeth dated 17 December 2020 at pp 140 and 141 . \n36 AEIC of Chang Quan Yin Elizabeth date d 17 December 2020 at pp 142 \u2013149 and pp 127 -138. \n37 AEIC of Phua Joo See dated  17 December 2020 at paragraph [29] . Chang Quan Yin Elizabeth Ann v The    STB No. 37 of 20 20 (Astoria Park)  \nMCST Plan No. 2120    \n \n19 \n whereas the subsidiary proprietors / occupiers were held t o the stricter Regulation 14 of \nRegulations 2005 .   \n \n31. This Board finds that , under the circumstances, it would be  a fair outcome to order the \nremoval of  the three (3) cats from the condominium.  In fact, the Respondent had contacted \nthe Animal Veterinary Ser vices (\u201c AVS\u201d) to enquire about loan traps on or about 10 \nFebruary 2020 (so that the cats may be trapped and thereafter sent for adoption) \n\u201cHowever, upon learning that the stray cats may have owners, the request to loan traps \nwas withdrawn. \u201c38  As the Board  finds the stray cats to belong to \u201cUncle Daud\u201d and not \nthe subsidiary proprietors / occupiers, the Respondent should proceed to contact AVS  on \nthe loan of traps and sending the three (3) cats for adoption as the Respondent originally \nintended.  In that re gard, Prayer (4) of the Applicant\u2019s application is allowed .  An order \nmade with respect to Section 101(3) of the Act may not provide for the payment of \ndamages .  Therefore, with respect to the Applicant\u2019s request for damages, the Board is \nunable to make an  order . \n \nBoard\u2019s Order (s) \n \n32. The Respondent should note that pursuant to section 29(1)(a) of the Act it is the duty of \nthe Respondent \u201c to control, manage and administer the common property for the benefit \nof all subsidiary proprietors \u2026\u201d  The Respondent\u2019s counsel argued that the Respondent \n\u201cdid not shut a blind eye\u201d to the Applicant\u2019s complaints of misuse of the tennis courts and \npresence of cats roaming in the estate.  In this case, it is not adequate to merely state that \nthe Respondent did n ot shut a blind eye to the issues raised by the Applicant.  The \nRespondent  has to take  reasonable  steps to enforce its supplementary by -laws and to \ncontrol, manage and administer the common property for the benefit of residents , which \nincludes the Applican t.  The onus of this ultimately rests on the Council of the \nRespondent. 39 \n \n33. While the Board has ruled that a special resolution would be required to allow commercial \nactivities within the specified times in a purely residential condominium such as Astoria \nPark, the Board would not prescribe the prohibition of entry of non -resident s with Astoria \nPark for tennis lessons as prayed for by the Applicant. As stated above, with regards to \npotential breaches of the by -laws as to the booking of tennis courts, the Board would not \nprefer to take an overly -prescriptive role and leave it to the  MCST to manage the situation.  \nFor example, non -residents may well enter Astoria Park for gratuitous  tennis lessons \n \n38 AEIC of Catherine Lim Siew Eng dated 17 December 2020 at paragraph [21].  \n39 Section 101(2) of the Act.  Chang Quan Yin Elizabeth Ann v The    STB No. 37 of 20 20 (Astoria Park)  \nMCST Plan No. 2120    \n \n20 \n conducted by a relative and/or a friend and so long as the other by -laws are complied with \nwould be free to do so.  \n \n34. This Board orders the Council of the  Respondent  to: \n \n(1) Enforce its  by-laws with regards to the usage of tennis courts \u2013 maximum 4 hrs a \nweek (including 2 hrs for peak periods) & limited to 1 hr each session per resident.  \n \n(4) Remove the three (3)  cats cared for by the MCST\u2019s gardener making their \npermanent habitats in the basement of Astoria Park multi -storey car park.  \n \nCosts \n35. The Applicant had largely succeeded in her case for the enforcement of the supplementary \nby-laws on the use of the tennis courts and the removal of the three (3) cats within Astoria \nPark.  The general rule is that costs follow the event and in this case the Board notes that \nthe Applicant\u2019s counsel has sought costs of $8,000 for the two (2) days of trial excluding \nGST, STB disbursements, and the Applicant\u2019s share of the costs of the transcripts.  \nRespondent\u2019s counsel was of the view that the costs should be $800 although he agrees to \nthe STB disbursements, the Applicant\u2019s share of the transcripts and GST , if any .  The \nBoard notes that costs are generally in the discretion of the tribunal and that the \nApplicant\u2019s counsel has sought costs on the low side for a 2 -day trial.   \n \n36. The Board orders the Respondent to pay the Applicant costs fixed at  $8,000  with STB \ndisbursements at $1,400 , and the Applicant\u2019s share of the transcripts at $1,438.51 , and \nGST, if any . \n \nDated this 11th day of  February 2021 \n \n \n \n____________________________  \nMR RAYMOND LYE  \n        Deputy President  \n \n \n \n_________________ _______ ____ \n        MR TAN KIAN HOON  \n        Member  \n Chang Quan Yin Elizabeth Ann v The    STB No. 37 of 20 20 (Astoria Park)  \nMCST Plan No. 2120    \n \n21 \n  \n \n \n \n__________________________ __ \n        MS HAZEL TANG  \n        Member  \n \n \nMs Wu Xiaowen  (M/s Lexton Law Corporation ) \nfor the Applican t. \n \nMr Gokulamurali Haridas / Ms Sancia Ng  (M/s  \nTito Isaac & Co LLP)  for the Respondent.

The areas of common property that the applicant wants \nthe Board to order the respondents to restore to its original  conditions are identified in \nparagraph 30 of the applicant\u2019s written submissions ( \u201cAWS \u201d) viz \u201c\u2026occupation of the \nwalkway and the roof and wall through the installation of the advertising signboards and \nawnings \u2026\u201d \n \n MCST Plan No. 4407  v Manohar K  D   STB No. 36 of 20 20 (Skies Miltonia ) \nNanwani / Seema Nanwani and Anor    \n \n3 \n Background  \n \n2 Skies Miltonia is a develop ment comprising 420 units in 8 blocks of 13 -storey buildings, \n10 townhouses and 1 single storey block. The single storey block is Blk 37. It is a \nstandalone single storey building approved as two shop units with a walkway in front of \nthe shops. There is no dispute that the shops and walkway are with in the strata plan of the \ndevelopment and that the walkway is common property under the control and \nmanagement of the management corporation.  The general public has access to the \nwalkway in front of the shops and can make purchases in the shops but cannot  access the \nresidential blocks because at each end of the two shops there are card access side gates \npermitting entry and exit to the residential blocks.  There is a jogging track behind the two \nshops and the shops have back doors leading to the residentia l blocks. At the midpoint of \nthe two shops , the walkway adjoins a planter/garden walkway that allows for access by \nresidents to the main road.  \n \n3 Manohar K D Nanwani/ Seema Man ohar Nanwani  are the subsidiary proprietors of the \nshop  unit at Blk 37 #XXX  and Kishin Doulatram Dadlani is the subsidiary proprietor of  \nthe shop unit at Blk 37 #XXX . \n \n4 On 1 July 2018 when the management corporation was being administered and managed \nby the 1st management council, a \u201cTemporary Occupation Licence Agreement\u201d (\u201cthe \nlicence agreement\u201d), which inter alia permitted the respondents to have, together with \ntheir tenants and licensees \u201c the continued use of the common walkway space\u201d  outside the \ntwo shops ( the space on the walkway was marked out) subject to a payment of an annual \nlicence fee of $960 for a period of one year, was granted by the management corporation. \nThe licence agreement was signed by Lee Kee Liew @  Victor Lim Chairman,  for and on \nbehalf of  Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 4407  and the two respondents. \nIt was renewable yearly (without an end date) upon payment of the licence fee within two \nmonths of the expiration date of the preceding period. In effect, there was a right to renew  \nfor an indefinite period of time.  \n \n5  Since the granting of the licence agreement the shops have been rented to tenants of the \nrespondents and with effect  1 January 2020 the shops were rented to Daniel Tan Boon \nHuat for six years for him to operate a 24  hours supermarket/mini -market. Refrigerated \ncabinets and drink dispensing machines are placed on the common walkway in front of \nthe shops and signboards and three awnings have been installed on the external walls  of \nthe shops. The awnings were installed af ter submission, by the respondents of a general \nlayout plan for works to be carried out, was approved by the management corporation on \n8 October 2019 and the signboards were installed after an application had been submitted, \nby the respondents and approval  was received from the management corporation on 17 \nOctober 2019. The tenant, according to the applicant, installed \u201cperplex sheet shelters in MCST Plan No. 4407  v Manohar K  D   STB No. 36 of 20 20 (Skies Miltonia ) \nNanwani / Seema Nanwani and Anor    \n \n4 \n the backyard of the two shops\u201d to provide shelter for his goods when the shops were \nrented to him.  \n \n6 The grantin g of the licence agreement, approvals for installation of the awnings and \nsignboards all took place between 23 September 2017 and 22 November 2019 when the \nmanagement corporation was being managed by the 1st and 2nd management councils . \n \n7 On 23 November 2 019, the 3rd management council was elected, and council members \nwere not aware of the licence agreement until after assuming office. On 26 June 2020 the \napplication in this case was filed.  It is the case for the applicant that with the consent and \napproval of the respondents the tenant has exclusively used and enjoyed common property \nwithout having a by -law made pursuant to a resolution under section 33 of the Building \nMaintenance and Strata  Management Act Cap 30C (\u201cthe Act\u201d).  \n \nRespondents\u2019 submissions  \n \nThe walkway  \n \n8 In paragraphs 5(a) and 6 of the respondents\u2019 written submissions (\u201cRWS\u201d), the \nrespondents submitted there was no encroachment/obstruction on the part of the \nrespondents of comm on property. The licence agreement was issued and endorsed by the \nmanagement corporation to  allow for tenants of the shops to place items for sale within  \nyellow boxes that were marked on the common walkway and if there was any \nencroachment of common prop erty, this was committed by their tenant and not by them. \nMCST Plan No. 561 v Pontiac Land Pte Ltd [1992] SGHC 190 (\u201cPontiac Land \u201d) and \nMCST Plan No. 901 v Lian Tat Huat Trading Pte Ltd [2018] SGHC 270 (\u201cLian Tat Huat \nTrading \u201d) were cited in support of the  submission.  \n \nThe signboards  \n \n9  The signboards are installed on the external walls of the two shops. Whilst there was no \ndispute that the shops are comprised within the strata title plan, it was the submission of \nthe respondents that the external walls of the shops are not common property. They \npointed out that the shops did not fa ce the residential blocks and submitted that they are \nnot capable of being enjoyed by occupiers of two or more lots in the development; that \nthey are standalone detached units and designed to be separate and different from the rest \nof the development; and are only used by respondent s and do not form part of the walls \nof the residential blocks.  It was also submitted that \u201c the external wall of the 2 shop units \nare comprised in the respondents\u2019 lots in that it is an integral part of the lots.  Therefore, \nthe applicants have failed to satisfy limb (a) of the definition of \u201ccommon property\u201d \nwhereas common property is defined as only part of the land and building not comprised \nin any lot \u201d.  It will be in order to note that whilst the respondents submitted that th e MCST Plan No. 4407  v Manohar K  D   STB No. 36 of 20 20 (Skies Miltonia ) \nNanwani / Seema Nanwani and Anor    \n \n5 \n external walls were an integral part of the lots and as such were comprised in the \nrespondents\u2019 lots, the strata title plan approved by the Chief Surveyor with areas demarked \nas common property or otherwise when the strata title application for registrat ion was \nmade under s ection  9 of the Land Titles (Strata) Act Cap 158 was not submitted in \nevidence.  And it was not the submission of the respondents that the external walls of the \nrespondents\u2019 lots were comprised in the lots because they were marked as such in the \nstrata title plan.  \n \n10 It was also the submission of the respondents that in view of the fact that approval had \nbeen given for the installation of the signages, the management corporation cannot retract \nits consent and compel the respondents to  remove them . Rosalina Soh Pei Xi v Hui Mun \nWai and MCST 4396 [2019 ] SGSTB 4 (\u201cSuites@Newton \u201d) was cited in support of the \nsubmission . \n \nThe awnings  \n \n11 The respondents submitted that the awnings were attached to walls that are not common \nproperty and were safety devices intended to prevent water accumulating on the walkway \nand seeping into the shops leading to floors becoming slippery and a hazard to user s of \nthe shops and common walkway. The awnings were also a protection against items falling \nfrom height (killer litter) viz the residential blocks and injuring anyone on the walkway.  \n \nDecision of the Board  \n \nThe common walkway  \n \n12 It will be in order to first determine the nature of the licence agreement. In the licence \nagreement,  the licensee (the respondents) are informed that the common walkway space \n(licensed area) outside the two shops is common property and that the licensee \u201c\u2026and/or  \nyour tenant s and licensees shall have continued use of the common walkway space\u2026\u201d  \nconditional upon the payment of an annual fee.  As noted earlier it was renewable yearly \n(without an end date) upon payment of the licence fee within two months of t he expiration \ndate of the preceding period. The terms of the licence agreement provided the respondents \nwith a right to renew for an indefinite period. Accordingly, the licence agreement \npurported to grant the respondents and their tenants continued use of  the walkway for an \nindefinite period of time.   \n \n13 A management corporation can, under section 33 of the Act make a by -law conferring on \na subsidiary proprietor exclusive use and enjoyment of; or special privileges in respect of \nthe whole or any part of common property pursuant to a resolution, dependant o n the \nperiod of time when exclusive use and enjoyment is conferred. In this case the licence \nagreement purported to confer exclusive use and enjoyment of a portion of the walkway MCST Plan No. 4407  v Manohar K  D   STB No. 36 of 20 20 (Skies Miltonia ) \nNanwani / Seema Nanwani and Anor    \n \n6 \n for an indefinite period of time and a 90% resolution would have been require d under \nsection 33(1)(c) of the Act. There was no dispute that the management corporation had \nnot in this case made such a by -law. \n \n14 Refrigerated cabinets and drink dispensing machines are placed on the common walkway \nin front of the shops by the respond ents\u2019 tenant. It is not in dispute that it is not the case \nthat the whole of the walkway is being used and that subsidiary proprietors and other \noccupiers can walk along and access the parts of the walkway that are not used and \noccupied by items belonging to the respondents\u2019 tenant. This does not detract from the \nfact that the tenant is, without a by -law made under section 33 of the Act, exclusively \nusing and occupying portions of the walkway for his business.  \n \n15 It was the submission of the respondents th at no order should be made against them \nbecause it was their tenant, and not the  respondents  who were responsible for the \nwrongdoing.  In Pontiac Land  the management corporation\u2019s application for an order \nagainst a subsidiary proprietor in relation to encroachment of common property was \ndismissed because the facts showed that it was the tenant who had without knowledge and \nconsent of the subsidiary prop rietor encroached on common property. In Lian Tat Huat \nTrading , the court was called upon to decide on the liability of the defendant subsidiary \nproprietor for damages arising out of a breach, committed by the tenant of the subsidiary \nproprietor, of a by -law in respect of encroachment of common property. In addition to the \nby-law in respect of encroachment of common property, there was a by -law that provided \nthat: \n \n \u201cAny subsidiary proprietor or occupier who or whose tenant or licen see in respect \nof his lot , encroaches and continues to encroach upon the common property shall \nbe liable to pay to the management corporation upon demand damages\u2026 \u201d \n \n The tenancy agreement between the defendant subsidiary proprietor and his tenant \nrequired that the tenant comply wi th the rules, regulations, requirements and by -laws of \nthe management corporation. The tenant was repeatedly warned by the subsidiary \nproprietor to remove unauthorised items and fixtures from the walkway and when he \nfailed to comply , the subsidiary proprie tor commenced proceedings in the State Courts \nfor an order of possession against him. Dedar Singh Gill J C (as he then was) when \ndeciding on the claim of the management corporation for damages against the defendant \nsubsidiary proprietor in respect of the b reach committed by the tenant dismissed the claim. \nThe claim was dismissed because under s ection  32(10) of the Act which provides that \nwhere there has been a breach of any by -law the management corporation is entitled to \nseek relief in court from any perso n bound to comply with the relevant by -law, the only \nparty that the management corporation was entitled to sue in respect of encroachments \nof the common property was the party who was bound to comply with the obligation not \nto encroach on the same.  MCST Plan No. 4407  v Manohar K  D   STB No. 36 of 20 20 (Skies Miltonia ) \nNanwani / Seema Nanwani and Anor    \n \n7 \n  \n16  It is clear from the above that the two cases cited do not support the submission of the \nrespondents that no order should be made against them because it was their tenant, and \nnot they who were responsible for the wrongdoing. T here was in this case no dispute that \nthe tenant was with the approval and consent of the respondents exclusively using and \noccupying portions of the walkway with items belonging to the tenant.  It was definitely  \nnot the case that it was the management corporation, and not the res pondents who was \npermitting the tenant of the respondents to occupy and use the walkway in connection \nwith the tenant\u2019s business. The licence agreement that was granted by the management \ncorporation was an agreement between the management corporation and t he respondents. \nIt was an agreement whereby approval was given for the respondents \u201c and/or  \ntenants/ licensees \u201d to have continued use of common property. It was the stand of the \nrespondents when they, following service of the application in this case, filed  Submission \nby Respondent (Form 18A \u2013 paragraph 15) that under the licence agreement, the \nrespondents and their tenants were authorised to occupy and use the walkway\u2026 and they \nhave never ever denied that the tenant was using and occupying portions of the wa lkway \nwith their consent and approval. They had also applied for approval for awnings and \nsignboards to be installed on the lots that were to be used for the tenant\u2019s business. For \nreasons not conveyed to the Board, the respondents had elected at the arbit ration hearing, \nnot to rely on their initial stand.  \n \n17  In view of the fact that the respondents have not been conferred with exclusive use and \nenjoyment of common property, and their tenant is exclusively using and enjoying \ncommon property with their app roval and consent, it is wholly in order for an order to be \nmade for them to restore the walkway that is occupied and used by their tenant to its \noriginal condition.  \n \nThe signboards  \n \n18  The Board is of the view that there is absolutely no merit in the submission that the \nexternal  walls of the shops are not common property.  In Wu Chiu Lin v Management \nCorporation Strata Title Plan No 2874 [2018] SGHC 43 ( \u201cSunglade \u201d) the subsidiary \nproprietor was seeking to install a covering over the trellis of her penthouse unit by way \nof an attachment to the external wall of her unit.  Chan Seng Onn J decided that the \nexternal walls of a penthouse unit in the development constitute \u201ccommon property\u201d. In \narriving at his decision he referred to the definition of common property in sections  3 (a) \nand (c) of the Land Titles (Strata) Act (Cap 158, 1999 Rev Ed) where \u201cwalls\u201d and \u201croofs\u201d \nwere specifically listed in the definition of common property and pronounced  (at 70):  \n \n\u201cIt is clear from the foregoing definition that external walls are clearly meant to be \nconstrued as being not comprised in any lot shown in a strata plan unless otherwise \ndescribed specifically as comprised in any lot in a strata title plan. \u201d MCST Plan No. 4407  v Manohar K  D   STB No. 36 of 20 20 (Skies Miltonia ) \nNanwani / Seema Nanwani and Anor    \n \n8 \n  \nIt was also his finding that : \n \n\u201cWhile this definition of \u201ccommon property\u201d was replaced by the passing of the \nBuilding Maintenance and Management Bill (No 6 of 2004) \u2013 with the 2004 version \nof the Act coming into force on 1 April 2005 \u2013 the simplification of the definition of \n\u201ccommon property\u201d in 2004 was not meant to exclude from the definition of \n\u201ccommon property\u201d the specific structures listed in the earlier iteration of the \ndefinition of \u201ccommon property\u201d. \u201d \n \n19 The curren t definition of common property in the Act includes examples of various parts \nof the land and building that are common property. Among the examples is the following : \n \n\u201cAn external wall , or a roof or fa\u00e7ade of a building which is used or enjoyed , or \ncapable  of being used or enjoyed, by occupiers of 2 or more lots, proposed lots or \nnon-strata lots. \u201d \n \n20 The respondents do not dispute that the two shop units are within the strata title plan. The \nfact that they are external walls on a standalone block and are not a part of the walls of \nthe other blocks and face away from the other blocks behind will not mak e them different \nfrom the walls of all the other blocks that serve the purpose of separating the inside from \nthe outside and which the respondents do not dispute to be common property.  They are \npart of the envelope of the building and considered an integr al component of the building \nfabric.  \n \n21 The respondents submitted that the walls of the 2 shops were not capable of being used or \nenjoyed by the occupiers of two more lots because they faced outwards and away from \nthe residential area. The Court of Appeal  in Sit Kwong Lam V Management Corporation \nStrata Title Plan No 2645 [2018] SGCA 14 (\u201cSit Kwong Lam \u201d) pronounced:  \n \n\u201c58  The second limb of the definition provides that a common property must \nbe \u201cused or capable of being used or enjoyed by occupiers of 2 or more lots or \nproposed lots\u201d. In our judgment, this was to be interpreted broadly. The words \n\u201cuse\u201d and \u201cenjoy\u201d are not defined in the BMSMA, but as pointed out by the STB \n(at [25] of its grounds of decision), the plain meaning of the word \u201cuse\u201d, as \nprovided in the Oxford Learners Dictionary, is to \u201ctake, hold or deploy (something) \nas a means of accomplishing or achieving s omething\u201d, whereas \u201cenjoy\u201d means \u201cto \nget pleasure from something\u201d. There was, in our judgment, no reason not to read \nthe words \u201cuse\u201d and \u201cenjoy\u201d, in the second limb of the definition of \u201ccommon \nproperty\u201d, in accordance with their ordinary dictionary meanin gs. \n MCST Plan No. 4407  v Manohar K  D   STB No. 36 of 20 20 (Skies Miltonia ) \nNanwani / Seema Nanwani and Anor    \n \n9 \n 59  In our judgment, based on their plain meanings, the word \u201cenjoy\u201d has a \nwider ambit than the word \u201cuse\u201d. We agreed with the STB that any area or \ninstallation that could affect the appearance of a building in a strata development, \nor that was part a nd parcel of the fabric of the building, could, by its mere presence, \nbe \u201cenjoyed\u201d by some or even all subsidiary proprietors of the development. Indeed, \nthere was no need for the area or installation to be physically accessible by the \nsubsidiary proprieto rs (or any of them) in order to be \u201cenjoyed\u201d by the said \nproprietors. \u201d \n \n22 The external walls in this case are areas or installations that can affect the appearance of \na building and are part and parcel of the fabric of the building. By its mere presence i t can \nbe enjoyed by some or even all the subsidiary proprietors of the development.  The \nexternal walls are common property.  \n \n23 The fact that the management corporation had given approval for the installation of the \nsignboards does not detract from the fact that the respondents have not been conferred \nwith exclusive use and enjoyment of common property in accordance with the provis ions \nof the Act. The approval granted when the management corporation was being managed \nby the management before members of the 3rd management council were elected was not \nvalid.  \n \n24 With respect to the submission that since approval had been given for th e installation of \nthe signages, the management corporation cannot retract its consent and compel the \nrespondents to remove them, it was noted that in Suites@Newton a subsidiary proprietor \nwho was distressed over inter alia noise emanating from a fixed awni ng installed by her \nneighbour in the flat below filed an application for the fixed awning  to be removed. The \nawnings were installed after approval had been given by the management corporation on \nthe basis that it was necessary due to \u201ckiller litter\u201d. It w as the finding of the Board that \nthe awning was installed because there was a \u201ckiller litter\u201d problem. After finding that the \nmanagement corporation had given approval for a fixed awning because there was a killer \nlitter problem, the Board referred to the decision of the Board in Pang Loon Ong and Ors \nv MCST Plan 4288 STB 21 of 2019 (\u201cD\u2019Leedon \u201d) where the Board found that a \nmanagement corporation had the power and was indeed under an obligation to prescribe \nguidelines in relation to awnings where there is a  killer litter problem. The Board then \nproceeded to consider whether it should review the management corporation\u2019s decision \nin connection with the fixed awnings and order the management corporation to prescribe \nretractable instead of fixed awnings. It was in these circumstances that the Board said that : \n \n\u201c46\u2026 it was far too late in the day for the Applicant to seek this order. An argument \nfor review may possibly be made if the MC had prescribed fixed awnings instead of \nretractable awnings before a subsidiary proprietor had acted on the MC\u2019s \nprescription. However, matters assume a different complexion  when a subsidiary MCST Plan No. 4407  v Manohar K  D   STB No. 36 of 20 20 (Skies Miltonia ) \nNanwani / Seema Nanwani and Anor    \n \n10 \n proprietor had acted on the MC\u2019s representation. There must be some finality in \nMC\u2019s everyday decisions\u2026 \u201d \n \n25 Suites@Newton  does not support the submission of the respondents that the management \ncorporation after giving approval for the installation of signboards which have, in this \ncase nothing to do with safety and was not in accordance with the provisions of the Act \nwith respect to conferring exclusive use and enjoyment of common property, cannot \nretract its approval and compel removal  of the signboards. The management corporation \ndid not, when it approved the installation of the signboards, in this case have the power to \napprove and confer on the respondents and their tenants the right to exclusively use and \nenjoy the whole or any part  common property without a by -law being made under section \n33 of the Act . \n \nThe awnings  \n \n26 Awnings are installed over the walkway in front of the shops. They are attached to the \nwalls of the shops and the extension over the walkway is supported by support poles with \nbolts and nuts screwed into the walkway. The installations have resulted in exclusiv e use \nof common property. Approval had been given by the management corporation for the \ninstallations, but there was no conferment of exclusive use in ac cordance with the \nprovisions of the Act.  \n \n27 It was inter alia the submission of the respondents that the awnings have been installed as \na safety feature in accordance with paragraph 5 of the Second Schedule  to Building \nMaintenance (Strata Management) Reg ulations  2005  (\u201cBMSMR 2005\u201d) . Under \nparagraph s 5(3)(a) and (c) subsidiary proprietors or occupiers of lots can install : \n \n\u201c(a) any locking or safety device for the protection\u2026against intruders or  to improve \nsafety within the lot ; \n\u2026 \n(c) Any structure or device to prevent harm to children \u201d \n \n28 It was the submission of the respondents that the awnings were installed to i) prevent \nwater seeping into the shops and causing the floors to be slippery and a hazar d to people \nin the shops ; and ii) as a protection against \u201ckiller litter\u201d viz items falling from the tall \nresidential blocks.  \n \n29 Regarding protection against \u201ckiller litter\u201d the applicant submitted that the nearest tall \nresidential block was 50 metres awa y from the two shops. The Board is of the view that \nit is highly unlikely that there was any danger from \u201ckiller litter\u201d in the case.  In the highly \nunlikely event that there was a danger from killer litter, the awnings would provide \nprotection to users of  the walkway i.e. people using common property and would not MCST Plan No. 4407  v Manohar K  D   STB No. 36 of 20 20 (Skies Miltonia ) \nNanwani / Seema Nanwani and Anor    \n \n11 \n improve safety inside the shops.  Paragraph 5 of BMSMR 2005 does not allow a \nsubsidiary proprietor or an occupier of a lot to install a safety device  on common property  \nfor the purpose of improvi ng safety on common property. Responsibility of such  \ninstallation would lie with the management corporation.  \n \n30 With regard to the prevention of water seeping into the shops, the evidence of Victor Lim \nwas that sometime in 2016 the respondents had sought approval from the developer to \ninstall awnings to prevent water collating on the walkway and the two shops. Approval \nwas not given, and the developer informed that the \u201c main contractor will construct a \ncurb\u201d. The curb was not constructed and instead  \u201ca small scupper drain was built to \nreduce the flooding\u201d. In Sit Kwong Lam v MCST Plan No 2654  STB 40 of 2015 , the Board \nconsidered the nature of devices that a subsidiary proprietor or occupier can install under \nparagraph 5(3) of BMSMR 2005 : \n \n\u201c34. It is clear that a subsidiary proprietor is allowed to install on common \nproperty any locking or safety devices for protection of his lot against intruders; or \nto improve safety within his lot. The subsidiary proprietor is also allowed to install \nany structure o r device to prevent harm to children.  \n \n35.  In the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary a \u201cdevice\u201d is defined as \n\u201can object or a piece of equipment that has been designed to do a particular job\u201d. \nA locking or safety device in By -law 5(3) of the prescribed by -laws would be an \nobject or a piece of equipment that has been designed for or can be used for the \nprotection of the subsidiary proprietor\u2019s lot against intruders or improve safety \nwithin the lot or prevent harm to children.  \n \n36.  It was the s ubmission of the Applicant that the aircon ventilation unit and \ntimber flooring were erected in the interests of the Applicant\u2019s or occupiers\u2019 \nwelfare, health and/or safety. It was also the submission of the Applicant that his \nchildren had respiratory trac t allergies and the installation of the aircon ventilation \nunit was necessary to promote cleaner air circulation within his unit.  \n \n37.  As noted above, the by -law allows a subsidiary proprietor to install a \nlocking or safety device for the protection again st intruders or improve safety within \nthe lot. Whilst timber flooring may prevent floors from becoming overly slippery \nwhen wet and an aircon and ventilation system can improve air quality the Board \ncannot find that the aircon ventilation unit and timber f looring are locking or safety \ndevices for the protection of the Applicant\u2019s lot against intruders. They are also not \ndevices that could improve safety within the Applicant\u2019s lot. \u201d \n \n31 An awning is a structure  that is designed for protection against sunlight and rain. In many \ncondominiums such are installed by unit owners/occupiers as a protection for users of the MCST Plan No. 4407  v Manohar K  D   STB No. 36 of 20 20 (Skies Miltonia ) \nNanwani / Seema Nanwani and Anor    \n \n12 \n PES against \u201ckiller litter\u201d from the units above. It is not a locking or safety device \ndesigned or  intended to prevent water seeping into the respondents\u2019 premises and causing \nthe floor to be slippery and hazardous to the occupants. It is not, in this case a  locking or  \nsafety device that can be installed in accordance with paragraph 5 of BMSMR 2005.  \n \n32 In view of all our findings it will be appropriate that the order sought by the applicant \nshould be granted. With regard to the time for the respondents to do the necessary we \nnoted that during mediation when the Board was attempting to assist the partie s to arrive \nat a settlement of the dispute, there was a discussion with regard to the convening of a \ngeneral meeting for the purpose of making a by -law whereby the respondents could be \nconferred with exclusive use and enjoyment of; or special privileges in  respect of the \nportion of the walkway and walls used. Settlement was not achieved because of \ndisagreements between the parties in connection with the terms for the convening of the \nmeeting. The Board considered that this was not a case where subsidiary pr oprietors had \nin defiance of rules, regulations or by -laws of the management corporation occupied and \nused common property. Rather it was a case where there was occupation and use with \napprovals that were granted in a manner that was not in accordance with  the Act. There \nwas no evidence that the approvals were granted in a manner that was not open or not \naboveboard and the Board was of the view that some time can be allowed for the \nrespondents if they are inclined to do so, to requisition for an extraordina ry general \nmeeting for the purpose of making a by -law whereby they can be conferred with exclusive \nuse and enjoyment of common property in accordance with the Act. Accordingly it is \nordered that, subject to the respondents being conferred with exclusive us e and enjoyment \nof; or special privileges in respect of common property in accordance with the provisions \nof the Act , the respondents are to restore the common property occupied and used by their \ntenant to its original condition on or before  24th March 202 1. \n \n33 It is also ordered that all fees payable to the Strata Titles Boards are to be borne by parties \nequally and there will be no order for costs.  \n \n \nDated this 13th day of  January  2021 \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ __ \nMR REMEDIOS F.G  \n        Deputy President  \n \n \n \n MCST Plan No. 4407  v Manohar K  D   STB No. 36 of 20 20 (Skies Miltonia ) \nNanwani / Seema Nanwani and Anor    \n \n13 \n  \n \n \n_________________ _______ ____ \n        MR LOH KWI LEONG  \n        Member  \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ __ \n        MR RAJARAM RAMIAH  \n        Member  \n \n \nMr Tng Kim Choon  (M/s KC Tng Law Practice ) \nfor the Applican t. \n \nMs Teh Ee -von (M/s Infinitus Law Co rporation ) \nand Mr Prakash Mulani (M/s M & A Law \nCorporation ) for the Respondent s.

The applicants are subsidiary proprietors in the development known as Pine Grove \nCondominium MCST Plan No 2032. They applied, under sections 103 and 113 of the \nBuilding Maintenance and Strata Management Act Cap 30C ( the \u201cAct\u201d) for five (5) orders   \nSingaram Kogilambal and 8 others   STB No. 22 of 20 20 (Pine Grove Condominium)  \nv The MCST Plan No. 2032    \nPage 3 of 14 \n in connection with the 23rd annual general meeting of the management corporation that was \nheld on 30 November 2019 ( the \u201cscheduled AGM \u201d).The first three  (3) orders applied for \nwere for the elect ions held and resolutions passed at the scheduled AGM and resolutions \nand/or decisions of the 23rd Management Council (\u201c23rd Council \u201d) to be invalidated. The \nfourth  (4th) assumed approval of the applications for invalidation and was an application for \nthe Board to make an order that a notice of general meeting be issued for a general meeting \nto be held within three ( 3) weeks from the date of the order. The fifth  (5th) was an order with \nregard to \u201cMCST Documents \u201d viz records, books of account, keys, access, documents and/or \nrecords belonging to the management corporation.  \n2. Under section 103 of the Act, resolutions passed and elections held at meetings of the \nmanagement corporation may be invalidated by the Board when the Board considers that \nprovisions of the Act in relation to meetings of the management corporation have not been \ncomplied with and under section 113, make orders for information, records and  documents \nto be supplied by the management corporation. The application for orders under section 113 \nwere  withdrawn when directions for hearing were given and after directions were given , the \napplicants informed that they were not proceeding with the application for the third  (3rd) \norder. Accordingly, what remained was an application for three  (3) orders viz:   \nAn order that the elections held at the meeting on 30 Nov ember  2019 known as the 23rd \nAnnual General Meeting be invalidated.  \nAn order that any and all resolutions passed at the meeting held on 30 Nov ember  2019 be \ninvalidated.  \nAn order that a notice of general meeting be issued within 1 week from the date of this order \nand that the general meeting be held within 3 weeks from the date of this order.  \nBACKGROUND  \n3. The application is a follow up of a previous application before the Bo ard viz STB 108 of \n2019. In that application, a notice, in accordance with the provisions of the Act, was given \non 25 October 2019 for the convening of the scheduled AGM that was to be held on 30 \nNovember 2019 at 2.00 pm.   After the notice had been served,  the management corporation \nwhich was then managed by the 22nd Management Council (\u201c22nd Council \u201d) decided to \npostpone the meeting (Singaram Kogilambal and Lee Hoong  Cheong, the first   and second \napplicants in this case were the chairperson and secretary of the 22nd Council). Instead of \nadopting the process provided for in the Act for an adjournment of a general meeting, a \nprocess that was not provided for in the Act was adopted when the 22nd Council issued a n \nunsigned  notice of postponement one day before the date of the scheduled AGM. Several \nsubsidiary proprietors did not accept the validity of the notice of postponement and \nproceeded with the scheduled AGM .   \nSingaram Kogilambal and 8 others   STB No. 22 of 20 20 (Pine Grove Condominium)  \nv The MCST Plan No. 2032    \nPage 4 of 14 \n 4. Minutes  of the scheduled AGM are exhibited at Tab 3 of the applicants bundle of documents \n(\u201cABOD \u201d). It can from the minutes be noted that the proceedings were not unremarkable. \nInter alia, the meeting commenced only after police officers at the scene confirmed that the \nsubsidiary proprietors who were present could proceed with the meeting; there was a n \nunsuccessful attempt made by Teo Eng Thye , the fourth ( 4th) applicant to stop the meeting \nwhen he announced that it had been postponed; the meeting was not chaired by the \nchairperson of the 22nd Council but by a proxyholder who was elected to preside fol lowing \na vote by way of a show of hands after an unsuccessful invitation to chair was made to the \nchairperson and secretary of the 22nd Council. Except for the six (6) items on the agenda, all \nthe other motions were passed, and except for the motion with r egard to contributions for \nthe management fund, where the meeting resolved by way of a majority vote to maintain the \ncontribution at $34 per month, there is no record of votes being cast in connection with the \nother motions. Except for one objection that w as recorded when the meeting was considering \nthe motion for adoption of the audited accounts and audited report , no objections were \nrecorded in relation to all other motions. The six  (6) items that were not passed were \nabandoned because there was no propos er or seconder for the respective motions. In \nconnection with the election of members of the 23rd Council, there were no proposals other \nthan one  (1) proposer and a seconder for the number to be fixed at eleven  (11) and the number \nwas fixed at eleven  (11). A list of eleven  (11) nominees was submitted by Ms Chan Tian \nSiang on 28 Nov ember  2019 and she presented this list at the meeting. There is no record of \nany other nominations and it is in the minutes recorded \u201cAs there were no other nominations \nthe following (nominees in the list presented by Ms Chan Tian Siang ) were elected as \nmembers  of the 23rd Management Council. \u201d \n5. On 24 December 2019 , two (2) applicants, one of whom had been elected as a member of \nthe 23rd Council at the scheduled AGM , filed STB 108 of 2019. The Board was required to \ndecide if the notice of postponement issued by th e 22nd Council was effective in postponing \nthe scheduled AGM and on 24 March 2020  and the Board decided:  \nIt is the decision of the Board that the 29 November 2019 notice is not effective and it is \nordered that the resolution/decision for the issuing of the 29 November 2019 notice be \ninvalidated .  \nNo appeal was filed in relation to the decision of the Board.  \n6. On 24 June 2020 , the applicants filed the application in this case. As noted earlier , the first \n(1st) and second ( 2nd) applicants , Singaram Kogilamba l and Lee Hoong Cheong,  were the \nchairperson and secretary of the 22nd Council and the fourth ( 4th) applicant , Teo Eng Thye,  \nwas a member of the 22nd Council. The  third ( 3rd) and fifth ( 5th) applicants , Wong Siew Yee \nand Yang Tze Chuen  Jason,  were members that the 22nd Council had purported to co -opt into \nthe 22nd Council after members of the 23rd Council had been elected at the scheduled AGM.  \n \n   \nSingaram Kogilambal and 8 others   STB No. 22 of 20 20 (Pine Grove Condominium)  \nv The MCST Plan No. 2032    \nPage 5 of 14 \n APPLICANTS \u2019 SUBMISSIONS  \nAn order that the elections held at the meeting on 30 Nov 2019 known as the 23rd Annual General \nMeeting be invalidated  \n7. Before the election of the members of the 23rd Council, the meeting had resolved that the \nnumber of members for the 23rd Council be fixed at eleven  (11) as there was only one  (1) \nproposer and one  (1) seconder for this number. The eleven  (11) on the list presented by Ms \nChan Tian Siang  were elected because there were no other nominations . \n8. It is not in dispute that before the scheduled AGM , nomination forms in relation to five (5) \ncandidates who had consented to be nominated for election had been submitted to a member \nof the staff of the managing agent , and nomination forms for two  (2) others were emailed to \nthe office of the management corporation. It is also not in dispute that the  seven  (7) names \n(the earlier nominees) were not announced before the eleven (11) nominees on the list \nsubmitted by Ms Chan Tian Siang were elected at the scheduled AGM. It was the submission \nof the applicants that the meeting had resolved that the number of members to be voted as \ncouncil members was based on the number of nominees available and if the meeting was \naware of the earlier nominees , there was a possibility that the meeting would have resolved \nfor a  number of more than eleven  (11). It was submit ted that the meeting should not have \nresolved that the number to be elected into the council be fixed at eleven  (11) when there \nwas in fact more tha n eleven  (11) candidates who had been nominated , and the chairperson \nshould not have declared that the eleve n (11) on the list submitted by Ms Chan Tian Siang  \nwere elected without a vot e when there were in fact more than eleven  (11) nominations .    \n9. It was submitted that the chairperson was obliged to obtain information in relation to the \nearlier nominees , before determining that there were no nominations other than th ose on Ms \nChan Tian Siang \u2019s list , and accordingly the rights of the earlier nominees had been \nprejudiced and non-compliance  in relation to the announcement of the names had affected \nthe result  of the election because the results of the election (of the eleven  (11) who were \nelected) would have been affected if the meeting had considered and voted on the \nnominations of the earlier nominees.  \nAn order that any and all resolutions passed at the meet ing held on 30 Nov 2019 be invalidated  \n10. In relation to the application for invalidation of the various resolutions , the applicants did \nnot make submissions linking non-compliance  of provisions of the Act with each and every \nresolution passed. It was submitted that all the resolutions passed should be invalidated \nbecause of the following , which the applicants submitted were not in compliance with the \nAct: i) the person who was elec ted to chair the meeting was not qualified;                                                 \nii) voting slips were not used. There is, in the minutes of the meeting , no record that voting \nslips were used during the scheduled AGM and it was the submission of  the applicants , that \nwithout voting slips, it would be impossible to ascertain the number of votes for or against \nand/or whether the resolutions had the requisite number of votes for the same to be resolved.   \nSingaram Kogilambal and 8 others   STB No. 22 of 20 20 (Pine Grove Condominium)  \nv The MCST Plan No. 2032    \nPage 6 of 14 \n In Form 18A where the respondent set out its su bmissions in response to the application , the \nrespondent informed that voting on the various resolutions was conducted by way of a show \nof hands and voting slips were not used because there were no objections. The applicants \nsubmitted that there were in fa ct objections to the resolutions passed because in the course \nof voting , by way of show of hands , it was not the case that all who were present had raised \ntheir hands in support of the various motions. It was also submitted that in relation to the \naudited accounts (resolution 4) there were more votes against (12) than votes in favour  (10)  \namong the proxy votes;  iii) there was failure to consider all the resolutions that w ere the \nsubject of the meeting when six (6) motions on the agenda were abandoned. The applicants \nsubmitted that a perusal of the proxy forms at Annex 4 of the respondents submission in \nForm 18A revealed that proxy givers had in a number of cases required the proxy holders to \nvote in favour of four  (4) of the abandoned resolutions and it was  submitted that the rights \nof these proxy givers had been prejudiced when the proxy holders were not able to vote in \naccordance with instructions given when the resolutions (10, 12.7, 13.1 and 13.2 of the \nminutes  at ABOD Tab 3) were abandoned;  iv) it was the stand of the applicants that to the \nbest of their knowledge there was no record of attendance at the meeting and that without an \nattendance list it was impossible to ascertain the number of share values represented , and \ndetermine whether that those  who voted were entitled to vote. While a n attendance list was \nsubmitted when the respondent filed Form  18A,the applicants did not accept that it was valid \nbecause the list was not revealed to them before it was submitted as an annex in Form 18A; \nthey ques tioned the number who attended was less than what  the attendance list recorded \nbecause the validity of the proxy holders were not verified; there was a cancellation on the \nlist; v) the rights of the subsidiary proprietors  who did not attend were prejudiced  when the \nrespondent had proceeded with the meeting  on 30 November 2019. It was submitted that a \nnumber of subsidiary proprietors  had no reason to doubt the validity of the notice of \npostponement that had been issued and accordingly did not attend. The res pondent in going \nahead with  the meeting had in effect denied the subsidiary proprietors  who did not attend , \ntheir rights to cast their votes and make oral nominations in relation to the candidates for \nelection to the council . \nAn order that a notice of gene ral meeting be issued within one week from the date of this order \nand that the general meeting be held within 3 weeks from the date of this order  \n11. In connection with the application for a notice of general meeting be issued , it was the \nsubmission of the applicants that the power to make such an order was provided for in section \n117 of the Act.  \nRESPONDENT \u2019S SUBMISSIONS  \n12. It was the submission of the respondent that even if there was non -compliance with the \nprovisions of the Act, there was no prejudice and co mpliance would not have affected the \nresult of the election.    \nSingaram Kogilambal and 8 others   STB No. 22 of 20 20 (Pine Grove Condominium)  \nv The MCST Plan No. 2032    \nPage 7 of 14 \n 13. In relation to the elections and non-announcement  of the names of the earlier nominees \nbefore the election of the members of the 23rd Council, it was submitted that this was due to \nthe fact that  the respondent and/or the subsidiary proprietors who proceeded with the \nscheduled meeting was not aware of the earlier nominations. The managing agent did not \nprovide the chairperson and the meeting with information of the earlier nominees and there \nwere no oral nominations when oral nominations were called for at the meeting. Staff of the \nmanaging agent and at least four  (4) members of the 22nd Council were present at the \nscheduled AGM and no one said anything about the earlier nominees. It was  pointed o ut \nthat the managing agent, M /s Nouvelle Property Management Solutions  Pte Ltd \n(\u201cNouvelle \u201d) who was contractually obliged to conduct the scheduled AGM by virtue of the \ncontract agreement with the respondent had not only failed to do what it was contractually \nobligated to do, its representatives had, according to the evidence of Mr Mok Chin Pow,  a \nmember of the 23rd Council at the commencement of the meeting , refused to provide access \nto the meeting room where the meeting was to be held and had informed the subsidiary \nproprietors that the scheduled AGM had been postponed.  \n14. It was submitted that b ecause there were no objections to the eleven (11) on Ms Chan Tian \nSiang \u2019s list, the declaration by the chairperson that they were elected was in accordance with \nparagraph 8(3) of the First Schedule of the Act.  \n15. In relation to the fact that voting slips were not used, it was the submission of the respondents \nthat handwritten  voting slips were issued when registration was being done. V oting was \nhowever carried out by way of a show of hands and as there were no obje ctions to the \nresolutions passed, there was no practical purpose for using voting slips.  \n16. There was an attendance list of attendees when identity cards and names of subsidiary \nproprietors were recorded. Copies of proxy forms and the number of proxies held by proxy \nholders were also recorded. It was the evidence of Mr Mok Chik Pow that proxy for ms would \nhave been checked on the spot upon submission , including whether the proxy givers were in \nany arrears to the management corporation . \n17. The r espondent answered the allegation with regard to the accuracy of  the attendance list by \npointing out that the  cancellation was a cancellation of one (1) of the names of two  (2) joint \nunit owners who had been registered. In response to the allegation of tampering of the proxy \nforms , the applicants had referred to a form provided by a Ms Savi where the name of the \nproxy had been cancelled and another filled in. The respondent pointed out that other than \nthe case of the one  (1) form referred to by the applicants , there was no evidence that there \nwas anything that was not in order with any of the other forms. In relat ion to the form referred \nto by the applicants , the respondent explained that the reason for the change was due to a \nmisunderstanding because that form was originally incomplete when it was received by one  \nVincent Soh. The name of the proxy had not been ent ered by the proxy giver. A name of a \nproxy was filled in by Vincent Soh and was changed when the person named was not around   \nSingaram Kogilambal and 8 others   STB No. 22 of 20 20 (Pine Grove Condominium)  \nv The MCST Plan No. 2032    \nPage 8 of 14 \n to sign the form.  Eventually , the name of the intended proxy was provided by the proxy giver \nand the form was filled in accordingly . \nFINDINGS AND DECISION OF THE BOARD  \n18. This was an application for elections held and resolutions passed at the scheduled AGM to \nbe invalidated pursuant to section 103 of the Act because provisions of the Act had not been \ncomplied with when the elections were held and the resolutions passed.  \nSection 103 of the Act is as follows:  \n103.\u2014(1)  Where, pursuant to an application by a subsidiary proprietor or first mortgagee \nof a lot, a Board considers that the provisions of this Act have not been compli ed with in \nrelation to a meeting of the management corporation or subsidiary management \ncorporation, or a council or executive committee, the Board may, by order \u2014 \n(a) invalidate any resolution of, or election held by, the persons present at the meeting; or  \n(b) refuse to invalidate any such resolution or election.  \n(2)  A Board shall not make an order under subsection (1) refusing to invalidate a resolution \nor election unless it considers \u2014 \n(a) that the failure to comply with the provisions of this Act did not prejudicially affect any \nperson; and  \n(b) that compliance with the provisions of this Act would not have resulted in a failure to \npass the resolution, or have affected the result of the election, as the case may be.  \n19. It is clear that a Board has been given discr etion to invalidate or not to invalidate when the \nprovisions of the Act in connection with meetings have not been complied with. It is only \nwhen the two  (2) conditions in section 103(2) are present that the Board will not have a \ndiscretion and must make an  order to invalidate viz failure to comply has prejudicially \naffected another and compliance would have resulted in a failure to pass the resolution or \naffect the election.  \n20. In Si-Hoe Kok Chun v Ramesh Ramchandani [2006] 2 SLR(R) 592 , Andrew Ang J held at \n[27] that where  \u201cthe failure to comply with the provisions of the Act did not prejudicially \naffect  any person and compliance with the provisions of the Act would not have  resulted in \na failure to pass the resolution [or affect the elections], the Board is  not bound to invalidate \nthe resolution \u201d. \n21. Invalidating when no one has been prejudiced or when non -compliance would not have \naffected the outcome would require the management corporation to go through a second \nprocess where time and money (in conve ning another meeting) will be expended \nunnecessarily . \n   \nSingaram Kogilambal and 8 others   STB No. 22 of 20 20 (Pine Grove Condominium)  \nv The MCST Plan No. 2032    \nPage 9 of 14 \n The elections at the meeting:  \n22. Paragraph 8 of the First Schedule is as follows:  \n8.\u2014 (1)  At a general meeting of a management corporation or subsidiary management \ncorporation at which the council or executive committee (as the case may be) is to be elected, \nthe chairperson of the general meeting must \u2014 \n(a) announce the names of the candidates already nominated in writing for election to the \ncouncil or executive committee in accordance with section 53B; and  \n(b) call for any oral nominations of persons eligible for election to the council or executive \ncommittee (as the case may be).  \n(2) After the chairperson of the general meeting declares that nominations have closed, \nthe management corporation or subsidiary  management corporation must decide, in accord-\nance with this Act, the number of members of the council or executive committee (as the case \nmay be).  \n(3) Subject to section 53A, if the number of candidates is the same as, or fewer than, the \nnumber of members of the council or executive committee (as the case may be) decided on \nunder sub -paragraph (2), those candidates must be declared by the chairperson to be, and \nare taken to have been, elected as the members of the council or executive committee (as the \ncase ma y be).  \n(4) Each person entitled to vote on an election of members of the council or executive \ncommittee has one vote in respect of each lot which he is entitled to vote.  \n(5) To avoid doubt, no poll is required for an election to office as a member of a council \nor an executive committee.  \n23. In this case , the minutes recorded that the meeting had chosen to decide on the number of \npersons to be elected as members of the council before nominations of candidates for \nelection were announced . When dealing with the motion to determine the number of \nmembers to the 23rd Council, there was only one  (1) proposer and seconder for the number \nto be fixed at eleven ( 11). It is a fact that the names of the earlier nominees were not \nannounced by the chairperson before the meeting electe d the eleven  (11) nominees on Ms \nChan Tian Siang \u2019s list. Accordingly, there was non-compliance  with paragraph 8(1)(a) of the \nFirst Schedule. It was however not the case that the chairperson had chosen not to announce \nthe names of the earlier nominees because he was seeking to hide their identities from the \nmeeting. There is nothing to indicate that he was  aware of the earlier nominees and of those \nwho were present at the meeting and aware of the earlier nominees not one informed him or \nthe meeting of these earlier nominees.  This included Mr Sebastian Chua , the executive \ndirector of Nouvelle  and t he 2nd applicant , Lee Hoong Cheong . As noted earlier , Mr Lee \nHoong Cheong was the secretary of the 22nd Council and he was , under paragraph 1A(2) of \nthe First Schedule , required to give notice of every nomination received. He did not do \nanything to inform the meeting about the earlier nominees.    \nSingaram Kogilambal and 8 others   STB No. 22 of 20 20 (Pine Grove Condominium)  \nv The MCST Plan No. 2032    \nPage 10 of 14 \n 24. The effect of the non-compliance  was that the earlier nominees were not considered before \nthe eleven  (11) on Ms Chan Tian Siang \u2019s list were elected and the submission that nominees \nwho could have been elected but did not have any chance of being elected because the  \nmeeting did not consi der and vote on their nominations had suffered a prejudice is not out \nof order. It was, however,  not the case that the prejudice was caused by the respondents. \nEven though the respondent was not responsible for the failure to announce the names of the \nearlier nominees, the Board considered if the results of the elections have been affected if \ntheir names had been announced. The  applicant has not put forward any evidence whatsoever \nthat it would have been , and in all likelihood there would not have been any change in the \nresult of the elections had the meeting voted on the eleven on Ms Chan Tian Siang \u2019s list and \nthe earlier nominees.  \nThe resolutions passed at the scheduled AGM  \n25. As noted earlier , the  applicants did not make submissions linking non-compliance  of \nprovisions of the Act with each and every resolution passed. Instead it was submitted that all \nthe resolutions passed should be invalidated because of various actions on the part of the \nrespond ent which the applicants submitted was not in compliance with the provisions of the \nAct. The application for invalidation of all the resolutions passed without linking non-\ncompliance  with the various resolutions passed in this case was really an applicatio n for \ninvalidation of the scheduled AGM. The Act does not provide the Board with powers to \ninvalidate a meeting  of a management corporation  in its entirety . Under section 103 of the \nAct, a resolution passed at a meeting and/or an election held can be inval idated only when \nprovisions of the Act in relation to the passing of the resolution or election have not been \ncomplied with. The Board cannot invalidate a resolution or election where there is no \nevidence that provisions of the Act have not been complied i n relation to the resolution \npassed or the election held.  \n26. The Board considered the various actions of the respondent which the applicants contended \nwere not in compliance with the Act to determine if any or all the resolutions passed should \nbe invalidated.  We examined the events in accordance with the progression of the meeting.  \nElection of a proxy holder as chairperson:  \n27. Mr Ignatius Joseph was elected as chairperson in accordance with paragraph 6 of the First \nSchedule that allowed for  the persons present a t that meeting and entitled to vote on motions \nsubmitted at that meeting may elect one of their number to preside at that meeting  when the \nchairperson of the management corporation is absent . \n28. It was submitted that Mr Ignatius Joseph was not a person who was entitled to vote under \nthe Act because he was a proxyholder without a propriety interest in the estate and did not \nfall within the category of a person who under paragraph 2(1)(a) of the First Schedule is \nentitled t o vote. Under this paragraph only     \nSingaram Kogilambal and 8 others   STB No. 22 of 20 20 (Pine Grove Condominium)  \nv The MCST Plan No. 2032    \nPage 11 of 14 \n \u2026 the subsidiary proprietor or a mortgagee in possession or a receiver of that lot as shown \non the strata roll and has paid to the management corporation all contributions and any \nother moneys levied or recoverable by the  management corporation under this Act; \u2026 \nare entitled to vote.  \n29. Mr Ignatius Joseph was the proxy holder  of Ms Susan , the wife of Thomas, a subsidiary \nproprietor of Blk 1F #XXX  and whilst a proxy holder is not specifically included under \nparagraph 2(1)(a) of the First Schedule as a person who is entitled to vote, it is clear from \nthe provisions in relation to instruments of proxy (paragraph 17 of the First Schedule) that \nvotes of a person who is entitled to vote can be cast by a proxy. The Act allows for a proxy \nto step into the shoes of the person who is entitled to vote  and to cast a vote as if he or she \nwas the person who gave the proxy. The Board does not agree that there was non -compliance \nwith paragraph 6 of the First Schedule when Mr Ignatius Joseph was elected as chairperson \nof the meeting. Even if there was in fac t non -compliance with paragraph 6 of the First \nSchedule, there was, in this case no prejudice and no evidence that compliance would \nresulted in a failure to pass any of the resolutions that were passed or would have  otherwise  \naffected the result of the ele ction.      \n   \nV oting slips were not used  \n30. Paragraph 5(2) of the First Schedule requires that votes at a general meeting be cast in person \nand voting slips must be used. It is not in dispute that voting slips were not used at the \nmeeting. The respondents submitted that voting on the various resolut ions in this case was \nconducted by way of a show of hands and voting slips were not used because there were no \nobjections . \n31. Andrew Ang J in Si-Hoe Kok Chun and Anor v Ramesh Ramchandani [2006]  SGHC 15  did \nnot consider that it was improper for annual general  meetings of management corporations \nto be conducted in an informal manner when he noted and applied the pronouncement of Lai \nKew Chai J in Jimat bin Awang v Lai Wee Ngen [1995]3 SLR (R) 496 : \n\u201cGenerally, a company exercises any of its powers by means of re solutions in general \nmeetings. It is also a well -entrenched common law principle that the unanimous and \ninformal assent by all the members of a company in some other manner is as effective as a \nresolution passed at a general meeting even if the assent is g iven at different times: see \nParker and Cooper Limited v Reading [1926] CH 975, and even if otherwise a special or \nextraordinary resolution is required: see Cane v Jones [1981] 1 All ER 533\u201d \n32. It was the submission of the applicants that there were in fact objections to the resolutions  \npassed because not everyone had raised their hands in support of the resolution s. The Board \nis of the view that a finding cannot be made that attendees who did not raise their hands in \nsupport were objecting to the resolu tion.   \nSingaram Kogilambal and 8 others   STB No. 22 of 20 20 (Pine Grove Condominium)  \nv The MCST Plan No. 2032    \nPage 12 of 14 \n 33. In connection with the motion for adoption of the audited accounts , a perusal of the proxy  \nforms will reveal that proxy givers had in twelve ( 12) cases required proxy holders to vote \nagainst the motion and ten (10) required votes in favour. In all other cases , proxy givers did \nnot give instructions as to how votes were to be cast , i.e. proxy holders had been given a \ndiscretion as to how he or she should vote . One (1) objection was recorded when the meeting \nhad resol ved to adopt the audited accounts after a vote, by way of a show of hands . \n34. The Board was satisfied that no prejudice was suffered by anyone because voting slips were \nnot used at the meeting and there is no evidence that any of the resolutions would not hav e \nbeen passed if voting slips had been used.  \nThe abandoned resolutions  \n35. The meeting was not called upon to vote on six  (6) items on the agenda. These were \nabandoned because there was no proposer or seconder for the motions. The fact that there \nwas no proposer or seconder was an indication that the meeting was not in favour of any of \nthe six  (6) motions. It may well have been the case that some proxy givers had required \nproxy holders to vote in favour of four  (4) of the abandoned resolutions. This did not change \nthe fact that there was no proposer or seconder for the six  (6) motions and it will not be \ndifficult to conclude that  none of the six (6) resolutions would have passed if the chairperson \nhad called for vote on any one of them. The fact that the six  (6) motions were abandoned did \nnot affect the resolutions that were passed and if they had not been abandoned, this would \nnot have resulted in a failure to pass the resolutions that were passed.  \nThe attendance list  \n36. There was a record of attendees at the meeting and it is exhibited at Annex 4 of the  \nrespondent \u2019s submission in Form 18 A. There is no evidence that it was a false o r invalid list.  \nRights of subsidiary proprietors to vote and make oral nominations at the meeting denied  \n37. It was the submission of the applicants that a majority of subsidiary proprietors did not attend \nthe scheduled AGM because they had no reason to doubt the validity of the notice of \npostponement that was issued in the name of the 22nd Council .  Proceeding w ith the \nscheduled AGM therefore deprived subsidiary proprietors , who thought the scheduled AGM \nwas postponed, of their rights to vote and make oral nominations.  \n38. Despite the finding of the Board in STB 108 of 2019 , it appeared that it was the view of the \napplicants that until the decision was released , the notice of postponement was valid . The \nrespondent was not in any way responsible for the absence of subsidiary proprietors at the \nscheduled AGM. A notice of the sc heduled AGM had been given in accordance with the Act \nand the scheduled meeting was held in accordance the notice. There is no provision in the \nAct that allows for an annual general meeting to be postponed by way of a notice of \npostponement after a notice for the convening of the meeting has been given and there was \nabsolutely no reason why the attendees should not have continued with the scheduled AGM   \nSingaram Kogilambal and 8 others   STB No. 22 of 20 20 (Pine Grove Condominium)  \nv The MCST Plan No. 2032    \nPage 13 of 14 \n on 30 November 2019. The responsibility for any prejudice suffered by subsidiary \nproprietors who did not a ttend because they were misled by an invalid notice must lie with \nwhoever was responsible for issuing the invalid notice. It cannot be in order that resolutions \npassed at a general meeting that was held in accordance with the provisions of the Act should \nbe invalidated because of the non -attendance of subsidiary proprietors who did not attend \nfor reasons that had nothing to do with the attendees.  \n39. Even though the Board was in this case not required to invalidate the resolutions passed and  \nelections held, it was conscious that the discretion given by the Act had to be exercised  \njudicially. Additionally , the pronouncement of Aedit Abdullah JC (as he then was) in Lee \nHung Pin v Lim Bee Lian and Anor [2015]  SGHC 171  that the general considerat ion would \nbe to exercise that discretion carefully and judicially, bearing in mind the likely objectives \nof the grant of that power was noted .  \n40. Inter  alia, the applicants submitted that the meeting was run by a group of thirty ( 30) to forty \n(40) individual s who were interest ed in pushing for resolutions that were in their interests \nwithout the involvement of the incumbent management council. In this case , the respondent \nhad proceeded  with the meeting after a proper notice had been given in accordance with t he \nAct. There is no evidence that the resolutions passed were not in the best interest of the estate \nor in any way  adverse to the interests of the estate. There is also no evidence that the members \nelected as members of the 23rd Council are dishonest or in any way  unworthy to hold office. \nThere can be no doubt of the adverse effects  on the respondent  if the Board were to invalidate \nall the resolutions passed and elections held. The fact that the applicants were not involved  \nin the scheduled AGM  was due to a decision that was made by no one other than themselves. \nThe Board was satisfied that there was in this case no valid or any good reason to invalidate \nthe elections held or resolutions passed at the scheduled AGM.  \n41. The applicati ons for the first  (1st) and second  (2nd) orders applied for are dismissed.  \n42. In view of our decision in para graph  41 above, the application for the third  (3rd) order sought \nis similarly dismisse d. \n43. The Board is of the view that it will be in order that we comment as follows:  \nThe application was an application to invalidate the elections held and resolutions passed at \nthe scheduled AGM. As noted earlier , there was no allegation that members of the council \nwho had been elected at the scheduled AGM were dishon est or in any way unworthy to hold \noffice or that the resolutions passed were not in the best interest of the estate. What was clear \nwas that the members who were elected as members of the 23rd Council were not supporters \nof the 22nd Council and the applic ants are seeking their ouster and for a general meeting to \nbe held in order that new council members can be elected. A management corporation is \nrequired under section 27 of the Act to hold a general meeting in every calendar year and not \nmore than fifteen  (15) months after the holding of the last preceding annual general meeting.   \nSingaram Kogilambal and 8 others   STB No. 22 of 20 20 (Pine Grove Condominium)  \nv The MCST Plan No. 2032    \nPage 14 of 14 \n When directions for a hearing were given after mediation was not successful , it was, \nconsidering timelines in connection with submissions, hearing and decision, apparent that \nthe applicants would be able to achieve what they were seeking viz a general meeting and \nan opportunity to vote for the members of the management council, without the need of an \norder from the Board.  Accordingly , the Board had expressed concern as to whether resources \nof the Board  were being expended necessarily. Regrettably, i t did not appear that the concern \nof the Board was shared by the applicants . \n44. We will hear parties on costs.  \nDated this  9th day of November  2020 \n  _______________________  \nMr Remedios F.G  \nDeputy President  \n_______________________  \nMr Lawrence Ang  \nMember  \n_______________________  \nMs Vicki Loh  \nMember  \nMr Tang Shangwei and M r Gerald Lai (WongPartnership LLP ) for the Applicant s. \nMs Chong Xin Yi Liesel (Gloria James -Civetta & Co ) for the Respondent .

The main dispute in this Application is the removal of fixed awnings installed at all eight \nunits on all the 14th floors of the development and the reconstruction of common external \nwalls that were demolished in those units.  \n  \n3. The Applicants sought the following orders in their application:  \n  \n\u201c(i) For the Respondent to do the necessary to remove the fixed awnings which have \nbeen installed on the common external walls of the balconies of various units at \nlevel 14 of the development  known as Bullion Park, including Units: -  \n(a) #XXX (Tower 1);  \n(b) #XXX (Tower 3);  \n(c) #XXX (Tower 4);  \n(d) #XXX (Tower 4);  \n(e) #XXX (Tower 5);  \n(f) #XXX (Tower 5);  \n(g) #XXX (Tower 6); and  \n(h) #XXX  (Tower 6),  \nas soon as reasonably practicable and in any event, no later than 1 month from the \ndate of such order (if any); and/or  \n  \n(ii) For the Respondent to do the necessary to remove the fixed awnings installed at \nUnit 170 Lentor Loop, # XXX, of the development known  as Bullion Park as soon as \nreasonably practicable and in any event, no later than 1 month from the date of such \norder (if any); and/or  \n  \n(iii) For the Respondent to enforce the motion that was passed during the 18th \nAnnual General Meeting on 10 November 2012 f or residents who have installed / \nerected / constructed / attached any permanent / temporary structures / fixtures / \nobjects on to the external walls shall remove such structures / fixtures / objects and \nreinstate the external walls back to their original condition before selling off their \nunit (notwithstanding that such structures / fixtures / objects may have been \npreviously approved by the MCST); and/or    \n  \n(iv) For the Respondent to invalidate the resolution which was passed during the \nAnnual General Meetin g on 17 November 2018 pertaining to the \u201cinstallation of \nfixed sheltered at balcony private enclosed space (pes) area at level 14\u201d; and/or  \n  \n(v) For the Respondent to do the necessary to reinstate the brick walls on the 14th \nfloor units that have removed the brick walls and replaced it with the sliding glass \ndoor; and/or  \n  \n(vi) Cost to be paid by the Respondent to the Applicants.\u201d  \n \n Mu Qi / Lim Swee Joo v       STB No. 87 of 2019 (Bullion Park)  \nMCST Plan No. 1849      \n  \n4  \n  The Applicants\u2019 Case  \n  \n4. The Applicants submitted that all the fixed awnings installed at all the 14th floor units of \nthe development and the brick external walls on the 14th floor units that have been \nremoved and replaced with the sliding glass doors were done without a 90% resolution \nas required under Section 33(1)(c) of the Building Maintenance and Stra ta Management \nAct (\u201c BMSMA \u201d), and hence they were deemed to be unauthorised structures; and the \nfixed awnings must be removed and the brick walls reinstated.  \n  \n5. The Applicants also submitted that the fixed awnings constructed at Tower 1 unit # XXX  \nwhich is d irectly below their unit had been causing them a myriad of health and safety \nconcerns. The health concerns include heat, glare, dirt, dust and noise. The construction \nworkers being able to stand on the awnings, being in close proximity to their windows \nand being able to look into their unit including their daughters\u2019 bedroom, was also their \nsafety concern.  \n  \n6. The Applicants further submitted that the awnings installed at all level 14 units have \naffected the fa\u00e7ade of the development and thus Section 37(4)(a ) of the BMSMA has \nnot been complied with.  \n  \n7. There is no exception to the 90% resolution requirement as there is no killer litter \nproblem facing the 14th floor units.  \n  \n8. The resolution passed on 10 November 2012 at the 18th Annual General Meeting \n(\u201cAGM \u201d) for residents who have installed, erected, etc. any structures/fixtures/objects \non to the external walls to remove the same before selling off their unit (\u201c the 2012 \nresolution \u201d) should be enforced, and the resolution passed on 17 November 2018 at the \nAGM p ertaining to the installation of fixed shelter at balcony private enclosed space \n(\u201cPES\u201d) area at level 14  (\u201c the 2018 resolution \u201d) to be invalidated.  \n  \nThe Respondent\u2019s Case  \n  \n9. The Respondent submitted that there was a by -law passed on 16 December 2010 to  allow \nthe removal of brick walls.  The by -law provides as follows:  \n  \n\u201cAll works which involved the breaking/removing of any brick wall inside any unit \nis to be endorsed by a professional engineer.\u201d  \n  \n10. The Respondent also submitted that before Ahmad bin Ibrahim and others v The MCST \nPlan No. 4131[2018] SGSTB 8 (referred to b y the Respondent as \u201cthe Belysa case\u201d), it \nwas unclear whether an external wall within the strata area of a unit is common property, \nand a 90% resolution was required for the installation of awnings on such a wall. Hence,  \n  Mu Qi / Lim Swee Joo v       STB No. 87 of 2019 (Bullion Park)  \nMCST Plan No. 1849      \n  \n5  \n  the Respondent had been giving a pproval for the installation of the disputed fixed \nawnings.  \n  \n11. The Respondent relied on their expert\u2019s oral evidence and his report in respect of the \nhealth and safety concerns raised by the Applicants.    \n  \n12. With respect to the enforcement of the 2012 reso lution passed at the 18th AGM on \n\u201cErecting, constructing, installing, attaching of structures, fixtures, objects etc. to the \nexternal common wall / ledges\u201d , the Respondent submitted that the resolution remained \na resolution and not a by -law that could be e nforced, and in any event had expired.  \n  \n13. Their approach in getting the 2019 resolution passed to address all, not specific, \nunauthorised structures is consistent with the decisions in Low Yung Chyuan v The \nMCST Plan No. 2178 [2019] SGSTB 3 (\u201cthe Castle Gr een case\u201d) and The Management \nCorporation Strata Title Plan No. 3436 v Tay Beng Huat and another [2019] SGDC 208 \nin that no SP should be treated differently from other SPs in the development.    \n  \nBoard\u2019s Findings  \n  \n14. It is not disputed that conferring on an SP of a lot the exclusive use and enjoyment of \nany part of the common property for a period that exceeds 3 years needs a 90% resolution \n(see Section 33(1)(c) of the BMSMA). There is no evidence produced to indicate that \nthere was a 90% resolution passed for the construction of the awnings in dispute and/or \nremoval of the brick walls in dispute.  \n  \n15. However, it is apparent that the 14th floor SPs who had constructed their fixed awnings \nand/or removed the brick walls pr oceeded on the belief and premise that the Respondent \nhad authorised them to do so.  The Respondent did not deny that that they gave such \nauthority.  The SPs had spent time, effort and resources acting on the Respondent\u2019s \nrepresentation.   \n  \n16. Whilst the dis puted awnings and/or sliding glass doors as they stand now might be \nunauthorised structures, these affected SPs should be given an opportunity to raise any \npossible defence and/or counterclaim against the Respondent if the Respondent is to take \naction agai nst them.  \n  \n17. The Applicants\u2019 prayers (i) and (ii) for this Board to order the Respondent to take \nnecessary action to remove the disputed awnings would be tantamount to this Board \nordering the SPs to demolish their awnings without affording them an opportun ity to be \nheard.  \n \n \n \n Mu Qi / Lim Swee Joo v       STB No. 87 of 2019 (Bullion Park)  \nMCST Plan No. 1849      \n  \n6  \n  18. Also, in the course of these proceedings, this Board was informed that the Respondent \nhad passed a by -law on \u201cUnauthorised additions, alterations and improvement work \nwithin unit\u201d (\u201c 2019 by -law\u201d),  after the filing of this application by the Applicants.   This \nby-law, this Board was informed, was to allow all existing unauthorised structures on \ncommon property to remain for the duration of the by -law presumably for a period of \nthree (3) years after which they must be removed .  \n  \n19. This by -law may well make the disputed awnings etc. to be authorised structures as they \nstand now.  This Board makes no finding as such because the said by -law was passed \nafter the present application by the Applicants. Suffice to say that this may gi ve the \naffected SPs another defence in respect of any order of their awnings and/or sliding glass \ndoors for demolition while this 2019 by -law remains in force.  \n  \n20. This Board will therefore not make any order directly or indirectly that would affect any \nSPs\u2019 interests and disrupt their daily lives at significant costs without them being before \nthis Board and afforded the chance to be heard and to raise any possible defences and/or \ncounter -claims.  \n  \n21. With regards to prayer (iii), the 2012 resolution passed at  the 18th AGM was not \nacknowledged by the Building and Construction Authority and lodged with the \nCommissioner.  As such, it has no force or effect (see Section 32(4) of the BMSMA).  \n  \n22. For prayer (iv), the Respondent has no power to invalidate the 2018 res olution passed \non the 17 November 2018 on \u201cInstallation of fixed shelter at balcony Private Enclosed \nSpace (PES) area at level 14\u201d .  From the evidence adduced, this Board is of the view \nthat the provisions of the BMSMA had been complied with in this regard .  In any event, \nthe 2018 resolution does not deal with the existing awnings at level 14.  \n  \n23. This Board also finds that there is not enough evidence to show that there is a killer litter \nproblem in this development.  \n  \n24. For prayer (v), the findings of the B oard in prayers (i) and (ii) are equally applicable \nhere.  \n  \n25. The Board, however, finds that the SPs of Tower 1, unit # XXX  which is directly below \nthe Applicants\u2019 unit had breached Section 63 of the BMSMA.  Section 63 provides, inter \nalia, as follows:  \n  \n\u201cDuties of subsidiary proprietors and other occupiers of lots   \n63. A subsidiary proprietor, mortgagee in possession (whether by himself or any \nother person), lessee or occupier of a lot shall not \u2013  \n\u2026  Mu Qi / Lim Swee Joo v       STB No. 87 of 2019 (Bullion Park)  \nMCST Plan No. 1849      \n  \n7  \n  (b) use or enjoy that lot, or permit that lot to be us ed or enjoyed, in such a manner \nor for such a purpose as to cause a nuisance or hazard to the occupier of any other \nlot (whether that person is a subsidiary proprietor or not)\u2026\u201d  \n  \n26. The expert witness of the Respondent in his report and oral testimony state d that the \nawnings at Tower 1, unit # XXX :  \n  \n\u201c6.1. \u2026have increased temperature which might result in heat reflecting into the \nunit of # XXX.  \n6.2. The white colour of the awning may be the cause of the glare into the unit # XXX \n\u2026  \n6.3. \u2026 the fixed awnings may be a source of dirt\u2026\u201d  \nand  \n\u201c6.3. \u2026the fixed awnings may be source of \u2026noise disturbance to unit # XXX  during \nthe rain.\u201d  \n  \n27. The expert said that these nuisances could be rectified by:  \n(a)  using an off -white polyurethane coating; and  \n(b)  washing the awnings twice a year.  \n  \n28. The Board is therefore of the view that the Respondent takes the necessary action against \nthe SPs of unit # XXX  to rectify the nuisances caused to the Applicants.  The R espondent \nis to give advance notice to the Applicants of any proposed works that will be carried \nout at the awnings outside their windows.  \n  \n29. The Board accepts the Respondent\u2019s expert report on security and finds that there is a \nlow risk of the disputed aw nings posing a security issue from intruders.  This is also the \nview of the Applicants\u2019 expert during cross -examination.   \n  \nBoard\u2019s Order(s)  \n  \n30. This Board makes the following orders:  \n(a) Prayers (i) to (v) in this application are dismissed.  \n(b) Respondent to take the necessary action against the SPs of 170 Lentor Loop, \n#XXX  Singapore 789099 to rectify the breach of Section 63 of the BMSMA \nwithin one (1) month from the date of this order.  \nCosts   \n31. Although this Board had dismissed all the Applicant s\u2019 prayers, it is of the view that it \nwould be inequitable for the Applicants to be penalised with costs.    \n  \n \n Mu Qi / Lim Swee Joo v       STB No. 87 of 2019 (Bullion Park)  \nMCST Plan No. 1849      \n  \n8  \n  32. The Applicants had spent much time, effort and resources prosecuting their case which \nis not without merit.  \n  \n33. The Respondent and their predece ssors in the administration of their duties under the \nBMSMA are not without fault.    \n  \n34. This Board is therefore of the view that it would be fair to both parties to order that each \nparty is to bear its own costs.  \n  \nDated this 2nd day of November 2020  \n  \n  \n  \n___________________________  \nMR SENG KWANG BOON  \n                Deputy President  \n  \n  \n  \n____________________________  \n                                    MR LEE COO  \n                Member  \n  \n  \n  \n____________________________  \n                           MS ZAHARA BINTE BAKAR  \n                Member  \n  \n  \nMr Lee Xiancong, Jensen and Mr Chan Jun Kitt @  \nHerman Lee (M/s Taylor Vinters Via LLC) for the \nApplicants.  \n  \nMr Adam Chong and Mr Roland Samosir / Mr Goh  \nE Pei (M/s Low Yeap Toh & Goon LLP) for the \nRespondent.

Lai Yew Sin and Chua Boon Keng (\u201c the Applicants \u201d) are the subsidiary proprietors (\u201c SPs\u201d) \nof a unit in the apartment development known as Bukit Timah Plaza/Sherwood Towers (\u201c the \nDevelopment \u201d). The Respondent is the Management Corporation S trata Title Plan No. 586 \n(\u201cthe MCST \u201d). On 31 December 2019, the Applicant s filed the present application against the \nRespondent.  \n Lai Yew Sin  and Chua Boon Keng  v The MCST 568  STB No.  2 of 2020 \u2013 Bukit Timah Plaza/Sherwood Towers   \n \n3 \n 2. On 31 July 2010, the 28th Annual General Meeting (\u201c 28th AGM \u201d) was held and a  special \nresolution passed . Th special resolution  empowered  the Respondent  to look into concepts and \nplans to replace the existing inefficient air -conditioning plants and related equipment proposed \nand recommended by Equation Energy Pte Ltd (\u201c EEPL \u201d), an accredited energy services \ncompany , and also to ent er into contract with EEPL for a fixed lump sum of S$1,630,000 .00 \nexcluding GST, and a further 10% as contingency sum.  \n \n3. On 1 June 2011, the Respondent entered into a  contract with EEPL and the terms of the contract \nfor the payment of the S$1,630,000 .00 were  as follows:  \n \na. 5% would be paid by the Respondent to EEPL on the signing of the contract ; \nb. 25% would be paid by the Respondent to EEPL on the confirmation of award for  chiller \nunits ; and \nc. 70% would be borne upfront by EEPL but recoverable from the Respondent from the \nmonthly energy savings, if any, for the maximum period of 6.7 years.  \n \n4. During the assessment to obtain the cooling load for the air -conditioning system, a bottle -neck \nwas disco vered at a section of the chilled water pipes at basement 2 of the building which \naffected the flow of chilled water. The Respondent then spent S$59,000 .00 to urgently rectify \nthis problem so as to allow for the smooth and efficient running of the replacem ent air -\nconditioning systems upon  complet ion. \n \n5. The contract for the replacement of air -conditioning and related equipment were carried out in \nJanuary 2012 and completed in March 2012 , with average energy savings of more than \nS$200,000 .00 per year.  \n \n6. On 15 January 2020, the Applicants commenced proceedings against the Respondent.  \n \nOrders Sought by the Applicants  \n \n7. The Applicants are seeking the following orders:  \n \na. That the Respondent be held liable for \u201cfailure in performing best practices and acting in \nthe best interests of the estate\u201d in awarding the contract for the replacement of air -\nconditioning and related equipment to the sole vender EEPL ;  Lai Yew Sin  and Chua Boon Keng  v The MCST 568  STB No.  2 of 2020 \u2013 Bukit Timah Plaza/Sherwood Towers   \n \n4 \n b. That the Respondent be held liable for professional misconduct in:  \ni. Material misstatement on entry of wrong item in account code;  \nii. Illegal alteration of past audited report without declaration ; and   \nc. That a committee of inquiry be convened to investigate for civil and possible criminal \ncharges.  \n \nThe Applicants \u2019 Case  \n \n8. The Applicants\u2019 case is that the Respon dent failed to perform their duties by awarding the \ncontract for the replacement of the inefficient air -conditioning plants to the sole vendor, EEPL, \non 31 July 2010 on the basis EEPL was green mark certified and provided financing without \ncalling for the tender for other vendors.  \n \n9. The Applicants questioned the need for the tender of chiller units, which was awarded to \nJohnson Controls (S) Pte. Ltd in November 2011, when EEPL was already hired to carry out \nthe air -conditioning replacement. They further ques tioned why there was no amount disclosed \nfor the chiller units.  \n \n10. The Applicants also questioned the need for another tender for replacement of chilled water \npipes at basement 2 of the plaza, which was awarded to Aim Aircon Engineering Pte Ltd on \nOctober 2 011 that led to a further incurrence of S$59,000 .00.  \n \n11. The Applicants submit ted that the Respondent had withheld documents relating to the \nirregularities in the hiring of EEL.  \n \n12. The Applicants further submit ted that the auditor had amended the 2018 Audit Report to \ninclude a new classification \u201cEnergy Saving\u201d and that these amendments were made without \nthe approval of the SPs at the 36th Annual General Meeting  (\u201c36th AGM \u201d).  \n \n13. The Applicants request ed that the Respondent hold the managing agent ( M/s Knight Frank \nProperty Asset Management Pte Ltd), auditing firm ( M/s Tan, Chan & Partners) and law firm \n(M/s Lee & Lee) liable for failure in performing their professional duties and acting in the best \ninterests of the estate . \n  Lai Yew Sin  and Chua Boon Keng  v The MCST 568  STB No.  2 of 2020 \u2013 Bukit Timah Plaza/Sherwood Towers   \n \n5 \n 14. The Applicants also request ed that the Respondent convene a committee of inquiry to \ninvestigate for possible civil and criminal charges.   \n \nThe Respondent\u2019s Case  \n \n15. The Respondent submit ted that at the 28th AGM, the general body was informed of the various \nvendors that the Respondent approached and that they were either unable to provide financing \nor the green mark certifi cation . An overwhelming majority of 99.26% of the SPs voted in favor \nof EEPL. This was reflected in the minutes of meeting.  \n \n16. The Respondent submit ted that EEPL is an accredited energy service company and not a \nspecialist equipment manufacturer or supplier and therefore there was a need to tender for the \nsupply of chiller units which was awa rded to Johnson Controls (S) Pte. Ltd. Further, as the \nsupply of the chiller units was part of the scope of EEPL\u2019s obligations in the contract, it was \nEEPL\u2019s obligation to purchase and supply the chiller units. No addition al costs were incurred \nas the cost s of the chiller units were already included in the EEPL contract.  \n \n17. The Respondent argue d that a bottleneck was discovered at a section of the chilled water pipers \nat basement 2 of the building which will affect the flow of chilled water. The changing or \nrenewing of the entire chilled water pipe network in the building is not included in the scope \nof work set out in the EEPL contract. Therefore , a tender had to be called for urgent rectification \nand the tender was awarded to Aim Aircon Control.   \n \n18. The Resp ondent argue d that there is no evidence that it had withheld any documents from  the \nApplicants and that the Applicants\u2019 requests for documents had been acceded  to.  \n \n19. The Respondent argue d that during the 36th AGM, the auditor had already explained to the \nApplicant s that the financial statements conform ed to the standards of the International \nFinancial Reporting Standards (\u201c IFRS \u201d). The \u201cEnergy Savings\u201d category was created to \naddress the Applicants \u2019 queries in the previous years which they, however, now find  fault with.   \n \n20. The Respondent submit ted that there is no evidence or proof to the Applicants\u2019 case. There was \nno improper conduct on the part of the Respondent , managing agent, auditor and solicitor s and \nthat the Applicants\u2019 case  is nothing more other tha n mere suspicion and speculation.  \n Lai Yew Sin  and Chua Boon Keng  v The MCST 568  STB No.  2 of 2020 \u2013 Bukit Timah Plaza/Sherwood Towers   \n \n6 \n 21. The Respondent argue d that the Applicants have confused merits/wisdom with legality. The \nRespondent also submit ted that the Board should look at the legality of decisions made and \nwhether the provisions of the B uilding M aintenance and Strata Management Act (Cap. 30C, \n2008 Rev. Ed.)  (\u201cBMSMA \u201d) have been complied with. Where  the Respondent  had complied \nwith the provisions of the BMSMA with no  illegal ity found in  the decision (s), the Board will \nnot and should not enquire into the merits and wisdom of the decision as it is for the SPs of \nevery MCST to decide how they want their development to be run.  \n \n22. The Respondent argue d that the section 101(1)(c) of the BMSMA  does not provide it with any \npower  to grant the orders sought by the Applicants , where the Applicants wanted the \nRespondent  to hold third parties (the managing agent, auditing firm and law firm) liable for \nprofessio nal misconduct especially when there is no evidence of impropriety. In the same vein, \nthe Respondent also has no power in the section 101(1)(c) of the BMSMA  to convene a \ncommittee of inquiry to investigate for civil or possible criminal charges.  \n \n23. The Respo ndent further submit ted that apart from the claims relating to the auditor\u2019s \nclassification of \u201cenergy savings\u201d in the audited accounts, all the other potential claims the \nApplicant s are seeking are time barred pursuant to section 6 of the Limitation Act  (Cap. 163, \n1996 Rev. Ed.) (\u201c Limitation Act \u201d). \n \n24. The Respondent conclude d that by virtue of the above reasons, the application should be \ndismissed with costs.   \n \nThe Board\u2019s Decision  \n \nAwarding of contract to EEPL on 31 July 2010  \n \n25. One of the contentions that the Applicant s had was the managing agent\u2019s typographical error \nin the exemplary note to the proposed EEPL project where electricity savings were stated to be \nS$200,000 .00 per month instead of S$200,000 .00 per year during the 28th AGM on 3 1 July \n2010. This was undisputed. The Applicants contend ed that the typographical error had \n\u201caffected the decisions of the SPs not present at the 28th AGM \u201d1 and had \u201c significant \n                                                           \n1 Paragraph 1 on page 2 of Applicant\u2019s Submissions.  Lai Yew Sin  and Chua Boon Keng  v The MCST 568  STB No.  2 of 2020 \u2013 Bukit Timah Plaza/Sherwood Towers   \n \n7 \n ramification \u201d.2 The Applicants also took issue that there was no open tender for other vendors \nand that the Respondent had \u201c pre-decided prior \u201d3 to choose EEPL for the project.    \n \n26. As evidenced in the minutes of the  28th AGM, the management agent had informed the members  present \nof the typographical error at the start of the meeting  before the members casted their votes. Therefore , \nit cannot be said that the members voted without taking the typographical error into consideration.  \n \n27. Contrary to the Applicants\u2019 contentions, the Board finds that the Respondent had exercised due \ndiligence and had approached four other vendors for the project.4 Further, the members present at the \n28th AGM were informed, before casting their votes, that the other vendors were either not green mark \ncertified or  not able to provide financing.5 Therefore , it is not the case that EEPL was the \u201csole vendor\u201d \nas what the Applicants had contended.  \n \n28. Based on th e evidence presented  before the Board , the Board is of the view that the vote to award  the \ncontract  to EEPL  was an informed decision  by the Development\u2019s members  at the 28th AGM  and there \nwas no misconduct  on the part of the Respondent in awarding the cont ract to EEPL. The Board also \nagrees with the Respondent that what was extremely surprising was that the Applicants had not \nquestioned the lack of a tender at the first opportunity during the 28th AGM and that it is only after ten \n(10) years that they decide to commence this proceeding.6  \n \nTender for chiller units and chilled water pipes  \n \n29. The Board did not find anything untoward with respect to the tender for the chiller units and chilled \nwater pipes by the Respondent.    \n \nWithholding and alleged illegal alteration of documents  \n \n30. The Applicants submitted that the Respondent had intentionally  \u201cwithheld key documents\u201d7 in relation \nto the \u201c potential corrupt practices \u201d8 in awarding of the air -conditioning replacement contract to EEPL. \nFrom the evidence presented, the Board finds that the Respondent had acted promptly and acceded to \nthe Applicants\u2019 requests for the documents. In fact, the Applicant s, at the hearing, said that they had \ninspected all the documents that were requested from the Respondents.  \n                                                           \n2 Ibid. \n3 Ibid. \n4 Page 33 (Exhibit CYP -1) of Chan\u2019s Affidavit of Evidence in Chief  (\u201cAEIC \u201d).  \n5 Paragraph 12  of Chan\u2019s AEIC . \n6 Paragraph 31  of Respondent\u2019s Submissions . \n7 Paragraph 3(a)  of Lai\u2019s AEIC.  \n8 Section D of Lai\u2019s Form 8.  Lai Yew Sin  and Chua Boon Keng  v The MCST 568  STB No.  2 of 2020 \u2013 Bukit Timah Plaza/Sherwood Towers   \n \n8 \n  \n31. In relation  to the audit reports, the Board is of the view that it is not in the position to comment on the \naccuracy of its presentation as it is not within the Board\u2019s e xpertise. The Board was informed by the \nApplicants at the hearing that they had reported the matter to the police and the matter was referred to \nthe Institute of Singapore Chartered Accounts (\u201cISCA\u201d).  As such, the Board will leave the investigation, \nif any , of this matter to the relevant authorities.  \n \nRespondent to hold the managing agent, auditing firm and law firm liable  \n \n32. The Applicants in their application on 31 December 2019 sought for the Board under section 101(c) of \nthe BMSMA to make the Management  Corporation hold the managing agent and auditor liable for \n\u201cprofessional misconduct and possible corrupt practices \u201d.9 In their AEIC, they sought for the Board to \nhold the management council, managing agent, auditing firm and law firm liable for failure in \nperforming their duties. In their submissions, the Applicants changed the orders once again, asking the \nBoard to hold  the Management Corporation, which now consists of \u201c Members of the Council, \nManagement Agent, Legal Advisor, and Auditor \u201d10 as a collective body, liable for \u201c failure in performing \nbest practices and acting in the best interests of the estate \u201d11 and to conven e a committee of enquiry.  \n \n33. The Board agrees with the Respondent\u2019s submissions that there is no power, duty or function imposed \non the Respondent by the BMSMA to hold third parties liable for any unsubstantiated allegations of \nimpropriety nor convene a comm ittee of inquiry.12  \n \n34. The Board also agrees with the Respondent\u2019s submission that pursuant to section 85(1A)(a) of the \nBMSMA, \u201c unless authorized by an ordinary resolution, a management corporation must not institute \nany proceedings against any person \u201d.13 There was no ordinary resolution passed or proposed by the \nApplicants to make the Respondent hold the management agent and auditor liable and as such the \nRespondent is not in breach of the BMSMA by not taking action against the management agent, auditor \nand s olicitor s.     \n \n35. Further, the Board is also of the view that the Applicants are cherry -picking sections from the BMS MA \nin an attempt to fit the orders they are seeking , which were  not the original order s they had sought for \nin their Form 8 application. As m entioned at paragraph 32 above, the Applicants had attempted to \nchange the orders thrice during the course of this proceeding. The Board is of the view that the \nApplicants are doing this as an attempt to circumvent section 85(1A)(a) of the BMSMA so that th ey \n                                                           \n9 Lai\u2019s Form 8, Section D.  \n10 Paragraph 1 o n page 1  of Lai\u2019s Submissions.  \n11 Ibid. \n12 Paragraph 20  of Respondent\u2019s Submission s. \n13 Section 85(1A)(a) of BMSMA.

Any complaints against the auditor and \nsolicitor s should be sought with the respective re levant bodies and not the Board.   \n \nSection 6 of the Limitation Act  \n \n36. The Board agrees with the Respondent\u2019s submission14 that apart from the Applicants\u2019 complaints about \nthe auditor\u2019s classification of energy savings in the audited accounts, all other complaints regarding the \ncontracts for the replacement of the air -conditioning and other related equipment are time -barred \npursuant to section 6 of the Limitation Act.15  \n \n37. Section 6 of the Limitation Act provides as follows:  \n \n\u201c6. \u2013 (1) Subject to this Act, the following actions shall not be brought after the expiration of 6 \nyears from the date on which the cause of action accrue d: \n(a) actions founded on a contract or on tort;  \n(b) actions to enforce a recognizance;  \n(c) actions to enforce an award;  \n(d) actions to recover any sum recoverable by virtue of any written law other  \nthan a penalty or forfeiture or sum by way of penalty or forfeiture. \u201d  \n \n38. From the evidence, the contract with EEPL was signed on 1 June 2011 and completed on 3 December \n2012. The contract for the chiller plants was awarded  to Johnson controls (S) Pte. Ltd . in November \n2011 and the contract for the replacement of a section of the chilled water pipes was awarded to Aim \nAircon Engineering Pte . Ltd. The whole project to replace the inefficient air -conditioning plants and \nother related equipment concluded on or around December 2012 . All these contracts were concluded \nmore than 6 years ago and are , hence , time-barred from any action pursuant to section 6(1)(a) of the \nLimitation Act.  \n \nSubpoena of witnesses  \n \n39. At the conclusion of the Respondent\u2019s case, the Applicants applied to subpoen a the following persons \nto give evidence: - \n \na. Lew Soon Poh, Council member;  \nb. Eleana Teo, Management Agent from Knight Frank;  \n                                                           \n14 Paragraph 27  of Respondent\u2019s Submissions.  \n15 Section 6  of Limitation Act.

Lee Soh Geok  (\u201cthe Applicant \u201d) is the subsidiary proprietor of a unit in  the condominium  \ndevelopment known as  Citylife@Tampines  (\u201cthe Development \u201d). The Respondent is  The \nManagement Corporation Strata Plan No. 4417 (\u201cthe MCST \u201d) of the Development .  On 1 \nOctober 2019 , the Applicant filed the pr esent  application  against the Respondent . \n  \n  \nLee Soh Geok  v The MCST Plan No. 4417               STB No. 88 of 2019  (Citylife@Tampines )\n  \nPage 3 of 21 \n Applicant \u2019s Case  \n2. The Applicant seeks the following orders against the Respondent:  \n\u201c1. To remove existing fixed non -combustible aluminium composite panel covers installed \nwithin the estate, be they PES/RT or other units, and reinstatement works to be done on \ncommon property, given the slew of associated problems they created for fellow \nsubsidiary proprietors (SPs) who live on upper floors in particular, and the tensions arose \nfrom associated conflicts exacerba ting the social disharmony due to legacy issues \nmishandled by developers and its appointed managing agency Suntec Real Estate \nConsultants P/L since TOP 2016  \n2. To i) remove the existing non -combustible aluminium composite panel with slanted \nretractable awn ings, recognised by STB panel of judges in previous similar cases as a \nnecessary, reasonable and proportionate response to the \u201ckiller \u201d litter problem after \nweighing the considerations of all affected parties and the two solution options.  \nImportant 12 Fact ors for Consideration  \nDesign Slant, Material Smooth Flow, Sheer Size  \nHeat, Noise, Cleanliness, Maintenance Ease & Frequency  \nWorkmanship, Durability, Privacy, Safety, Costs  \nii) specify specific TIMELINES for change implementation as well as 3 -5yrs equipment  \nreplacement (or when mouldiness is spotted on material, whichever is earlier);  \niii) establish specific RESPONSIBILITY of respective cleaning costs is to be borne by \nrespective PES/RT SPs, made payable to MCST on a monthly basis and structured into \nautomat ic additional maintenance fees to eliminate further future disputes on ownership \nof maintenance costs & responsibilities.  \niv) state specific FIXED (THRICE) WEEKLY PROFESSIONAL CLEANING \nSCHEDULE, given our location site near main traffic roads and huge cons truction site \n(Tampines North) from now till change replacement and thereafter where applicable;  \nv) assign prevailing MANAGING AGENCY as the appointed body to source for and \ncoordinate regular professional cleaning.  \nvi) identify SPECIFIC UNIT AREA FOR WALL ATTACHMENT, i.e. on own unit \u2019s walls \nat the buffer (coloured red or green in pic) 11\u201d x 11\u201d or unit \u2019s side walls, as opposed to \ncommon property (blue).  \n3.

The Respondent \u2019s case may be summarised as follows:  \n\u201c4. (Replacement of Fixed Awnings with Retractable Awnings)  The Respondent is enti-\ntled to decide on the design of awnings in the development, and has decided that they \nshould be fixed awnings.  It does not matter whether an alternative design might be a \nnecessary, reasonable and proportionate response to killer li tter, or otherwise better in \nsome way.  Approval was given by the Developer, but even if it was not, the Respondent \ncannot prevent the subsidiary proprietors from installing the fixed awnings since they are \nsafety devices.  \n\u201c5. (Proposed Guidelines for Awni ngs) The Board will not micromanage management \ncorporations or interfere in their decisions by imposing such minute guidelines as the \nApplicant desires.  She is attempting to circumvent the decision -making processes of the \nRespondent by asking the Board to  have her suggestions set in stone as rules for the \ndevelopment.  \n6.(Water Pipes ) These were approved by the developer and installed before the \nRespondent \u2019s constitution.  Since the Respondents have been advised that they are \nunlikely to succeed in legal pr oceedings against the subsidiary proprietors, they are \nentitled to exercise their discretion not to do so.  \n7. (Fines and Penalties ) Management Corporations have no power under the Building \nMaintenance and Strata Management Act (Cap 30C)  (\u201cBMSMA \u201d) to impose  fines and \npenalties for breaches of by -laws, and the Board cannot grant the Respondent such \npowers when it is not provided for under the BMSMA. \u201d2 \nThe Law on the Installation of Awnings  in Strata Developments  \n4. There are  several issues in relation to the installation of awnings  in the present case :  \n(a) whether a special resolution or 90% resolution  is required  to enact the necessary by -\nlaw allowing for the installation of  awnings ;  \n(b) if the requisite  resolution is not obtained, whether there is a  statutory prov ision  within \nthe statutory scheme which  allows subsidiary proprietors to install  awnings  if safety \nconcerns are established ; and  \n                                                           \n1 Applicant \u2019s Closing Submission  \n2 Respondent \u2019s Closing Submission.   \n  \nLee Soh Geok  v The MCST Plan No. 4417               STB No. 88 of 2019  (Citylife@Tampines )\n  \nPage 6 of 21 \n (c) whether the management corporation  should be ordered to prescribe retractable \nawnings when fixed awnings have already been installed . \nA. Whether a 90% Resolution is Required  \n5. Section 33(1)(c) of the BMSMA stipulates that a 90% resolution is required to make by -laws \nconferring on subsidiary  proprietors the exclusive use and enjoyment of or special privileges \nin respect of the whole or any part of common property exceeding three years.   In Wu Chiu \nLin v Management Corporation Strata Title Plan (\u201cThe Sunglade \u201d) [2018] 4 SLR 975 , Chan  \nSeng Onn  J held that common property included external walls of a strata development .  \nTherefore, a by-law allowing a  subsidiary proprietor who wished to install coverings over \nroof trellises has to be passed by a 90% resolution because the installation o f coverings over \nthe roof trellises involved the conferring of exclusive use and enjoyment of or special privi-\nleges exceeding three years in respect of common property.   This decision has been followed \nby the Board in  Ahmad bin Ibrahim and 21 others v The MCST Plan No. 4131  (\u201cThe Belysa \u201d) \n[2018] SGSTB 8 at [26]  and Rosalina Soh Pei Xi v Hui Mun Wai and The Management Cor-\nporation Strata Title Plan No 4396  [2019] SGSTB 5 (\u201cSuites@Newton \u201d).  \nB. W hether there is a Statutory Provision which Allows for the Installation of Awnings Due to \nSafety Concerns   \n6. However, even if the necessary 90% resolution is not obtained , the statute contemplates that \nawnings may be installed due to safety concerns. Section 3 2(2) of the BMSMA  provides:  \n\u201cby-laws prescribed by r egulations shall be the by -laws for every parcel comprised \nin a strata title plan in respect of which a management corporation is constituted \non or after 1st April 2005, and no by -law made under this section or section  33 \nshall be inconsistent with any suc h prescribed by -law.\u201d (emphasis added)  \n7. Therefore, by-laws prescribed by regulations or what is known as statutory by -laws are by -\nlaws for every parcel comprised in a strata title plan.  It is important to note that section 33 \nof the BMSMA is subject to section 32(2) of the BMSMA.  In other words, any by -laws made \npursuant to section 33 may not be inconsistent with the statut ory by -laws.  \n8. The Second Schedule to  the Building Maintenance (Strata Management) Regulations 2005 \n(\u201cBMSMR 2005 \u201d) contains these statutory by -laws. Paragraph 5(1) of the Second Schedule \nprovides that:  \n\u201c5.\u2014(1) A subsidiary proprietor or an occupier of a lot shall not mark, paint, drive \nnails or screws or the like into, or otherwise damage or deface, any structure that \nforms part of the common property except with the prior written approval of the \nmanagement corporation. \u201d \n  \n  \nLee Soh Geok  v The MCST Plan No. 4417               STB No. 88 of 2019  (Citylife@Tampines )\n  \nPage 7 of 21 \n 9. Paragraph  5(1) of the Second Schedule of the BMSMR 2005  is qualified by paragraph 5(3) \n(\u201cby-law 5(3)\u201d) which provides:  \n\u201c(3) This by -law shall not prevent a subsidiary proprietor or an occupier of a lot, or a \nperson authorised by such subsidiary proprietor or occupier from installing  \u2014 \n(a) any locking or other  safety device for protection of the subsidiary proprie-\ntor\u2019s or occupier \u2019s lot against intruders or to improve safety within that lot ; \n(b) any screen or other device to prevent entry of animals or insects  on the lot ; \n(c) any structure or device  to prevent harm to children ; or \n(d) any device used to affix decorative items to the internal surfaces of walls in \nthe subsidiary proprietor\u2019s or occupier\u2019s lot.\u201d  (emphasis added)  \n10. The resultant position is that the statutory by -laws do not prevent a subsidiary proprietor from \ninstalling \u201cany structure or device to prevent harm to children \u201d.  The statutory force of this \nby-law is derived from section 32(2) of the BMSMA  which takes precedence over section 33 \nof the BMSMA .  This is consistent with first principles because although strata titles are mini \ndemocracies , there are matters such as safety concerns which should be regarded as more \nimportant than majority rule.  D r Cathy Sherry, explains perceptively in her monograph, \nStrata Title Property Rights[ :] Private Governance of Multi -Owned Properties  (Routledge, \n2017) at 218: \n\u201cThe majority may act in ways that are harmful to others, including children, even \nto the point o f making decisions that are inimical to their physical safety \u2026Left to \ntheir own devices, bodies corporate have not protected children and so the \nlegislature needed to step in .\u201d \n11. The interpretation that the statutory by -law takes precedence over the general authority of the \ncollective is supported by  Dr Sherry \u2019s writings on the New South Wales \u2019 statutory regime  \nwhich is similar to Singapore \u2019s statute .  Dr Cathy Sherry, writing on the New  South Wales \nframework  in Strata Title Property Rights[ :] Private  Governance of Multi -Owned Properties , \n(Routledge, 2017) at  219: \n\u201cThere seems to be some confusion a mong  strata  managers  and executive  committees \nabout the appropriate function and ambit of by -laws. Many  residential  schemes in \nSydney use the New South Wales \u2019 model by -laws which prohibit the driving of screws \nthrough common property without body corporate consent.  However, the model by -law \nexempts an owner, or person authorised by the owner, installing \u2018any structure  or device \nto prevent harm to children \u2019  As a result, an owner can install barriers or nets to protect \nchildren, without body corporate permission.  In the Second Reading Speech for the \nStrata Schemes Management Bill 1996 (NSW), the Minister for Fair Tradin g, Mrs Lo \nPo said that:  \nThe bill takes  special  account  of circumstances  where  children  live in strata  \nschemes ... security measures taken to ensure the safety of children, for  \n  \nLee Soh Geok  v The MCST Plan No. 4417               STB No. 88 of 2019  (Citylife@Tampines )\n  \nPage 8 of 21 \n instance falling from balconies, will be automatically permitted. The body \ncorporate  will not be able to prevent  an owner  or someone  authorised  by the \nowner from taking these measures [if ] an appropriate standard and in \nkeeping with the appearance of the  building.\"'  \nIt seems  clear  that the model  by-law was intended  to remove  safety  devices  for \nchildren  from the general  authority  of the collective,  and to vest it in individual \nowners, that is,  parents \u201d. (emphasis added)  \n12. The position that the prescribed by-law 5(3)(c) allows for the installation  of a structure or \ndevice on common property in order to prevent harm to children without approval of the \nManagement Corporation appears to be endorsed  in Sit Kwong Lam v Management Corpo-\nration Strata Title Plan No 2645 (\u201cThe Ardmore Park \u201d) [2018] 1 SLR 79 0.  Menon CJ  in \nThe Ardmore Park  at [72] interpreted paragraph 5(3)(c) of the Second  Schedule of the \nBMSMR 2005 in the following manner:  \n\u201c\u2026Reading the exception in by -law 5(3)(c) in a consistent way, we were of the view \nthat it must similarly be limited to the situation where a subsidiary proprietor erected \na structure or device on common property in order to prevent harm to children while \nthey were within his lot . (emphasis in the original) \u201d \n13. The position that awnings may be installed  if there are safety concerns was implicitly ac-\ncepted by Chan Seng Onn J in  The Sunglade [2018] 4 SLR 975  at [90] who observed:  \n\u201cFirst, it is wrong for Ms  Wu to assert that the subsidiary proprietors of the pent-\nhouse units should be entitled to install coverings over the roof trellises just because \nthe other subsidiary proprietors occupying the ground floor units had been entitled \nto install coverings over the PES trellises. The Management Corporation clearly \nstated that it was not objecting to the installation of coverings over the PES trellises \nonly because it agreed that such an installation constituted the installation of safety \ndevices for the improveme nt of safety within the ground floor units as provided for \nby the prescribed by -law reflected in para  5(3) of the Second Schedule to the Reg-\nulations (see  [13] above). The same clearly cannot be said of the installation of \ncoverings over the roof trellises,  given that the penthouse units are not being af-\nflicted with the problem of killer litter that the subsidiary proprietors of the ground \nfloor units have been having to endure \u201d. \n14. If the Management Corporation in The Sunglade  was not entitled to take the position that \ncoverings could be installed due to the problem of \u201ckiller \u201d litter  without a 90 % resolution , \nChan J would surely have said so.  The position that a subsidiary proprietor is entitled to \ninstall an awning when the re is a \u201ckiller \u201d litter problem has also been accepted by the Board \nin The Belysa  [2018] SGSTB 8  and Pang Loon Ong and Ors v The MCST Plan No 4288 \n(\u201cD\u2019Leedon \u201d) [2019] SGSTB 6.   \n  \nLee Soh Geok  v The MCST Plan No. 4417               STB No. 88 of 2019  (Citylife@Tampines )\n  \nPage 9 of 21 \n 15. Another issue is whether section 37A of the BMSMA  which was enacted in 2019 precludes \nthis Board from holding that a subsidiary proprietor may install awnings if there is a \u2018killer \u2019 \nlitter problem.  Section 37A of the BMSMA provides as follows:  \n37A. \u2014(1) A subsidiary proprietor of a lot in a building on a  parcel comprised in a \nstrata title plan may install safety equipment on the lot, or as part of any window, door \nor opening on the lot which is facing outdoors, despite any other provision of this Act \nor the regulations or any by -law of the parcel which ot herwise prohibits the installation \nof such safety equipment.  \n(2)   A subsidiary proprietor of a lot in a building who installs safety equipment under \nthis section must  \u2014 \n(a) repair any damage caused to any part of the common property or limited \ncommon property (as the case may be) by the installation of the safety \nequipment; and  \n(b) ensure that the safety equipment is installed in a competent and proper manner \nand has an appearance, after it has been installed, in keeping with the \nappearance of  the building.  \n \n(3)   In this section, \u201csafety equipment \u201d means  \u2014 \n(a) any of the following features to prevent people from falling over the edge of \nan outdoor -facing balcony or terrace or a window or door or an opening which \nis outdoor -facing:  \n(i) a window grille or screen;  \n(ii) a balustrade, railing or fence;  \n \n(b) any device capable of restricting the opening of a window or door or an \nopening which is outdoor -facing;  \n(c) any screen or other device to prevent entry of animals or insects on the lot;  \n(d) an intruder alarm or monitoring system; and  \n(e) any lock or other security mechanism that is designed to protect occupiers of \nthe lot against intruders to the lot.  \n \n16. We are of the opinion that section 37A of the BMSMA does not exclude the position that an \nawning may be installed when there is a \u2018killer \u2019 litter problem even if there is no 90 % reso-\nlution.  As the Board said in D\u2019Leedon  [2019] SGSTB 6 at [17] \u2013 [18]: \nThe definition of \u201csafety equipment\u201d in section 37A of BMSMA does not appear to \ninclude awnings. Does the amendment mean that Parliament had by implication \nexcluded the management corporation\u2019s power to prescribe guidelines in relation \nto awnings to counter a  \u201ckiller\u201d litter problem? This Board is of the view that a \ncareful analysis of the statutory framework will show that section 37A of the \nBMSMA did not affect a management corporation\u2019s ability to prescribe guidelines  \n  \nLee Soh Geok  v The MCST Plan No. 4417               STB No. 88 of 2019  (Citylife@Tampines )\n  \nPage 10 of 21 \n with respect to awnings if there is a \u201c killer\u201d litter problem. Section 37A of the \nBMSMA deals with the specific issue of \u201csafety equipment\u201d and not \u201cany structure \nor device to prevent harm to children\u201d mentioned in paragraph 5(3)(c) of the 2nd \nSchedule to the BMSMR 2005. The omission to deal with these other structures or \ndevices in section 37A did not, in this Board\u2019s view, signal an intention by Parlia-\nment to abolish the subsidiary proprietor\u2019s rights to install these items to protect \ntheir c hildren. In other words, section 37A of the BMSMA did not preclude a sub-\nsidiary proprietor from installing any structure or device on common property to \nprevent harm to a child while the child is within his or her lot and the management \ncorporation may pre scribe guidelines in relation to the installation of such devices \nor structures. This interpretation is fortified by paragraph 5(4) of the 2nd Schedule \nto the BMSMR 2005 which provides:  \nAny such locking or safety device, screen, other device or structure  must be installed \nin a competent and proper manner and must have an appearance, after it has been \ninstalled, in keeping with such guidelines as the management corporation may pre-\nscribe regarding such installations , and with the appearance of the rest of the  build-\ning. (emphasis added)  \nThus, it is clear that management corporations may prescribe guidelines in relation \nto awnings which may fall within the definition of \u201cother device or structure\u201d when \nthere is a \u201ckiller\u201d litter problem.  \n17. The final issue is wheth er subsidiary proprietors who have installed fixed awnings  with the \napproval of the management corporation due to a \u201ckiller \u201d litter problem may be asked to take \ndown the fixed awnings and install retractable awnings.  The short answer is no.  As the Board \nsaid in the Suites@Newton  [2019] SGSTB 5 in the context of an Applicant seeking a Re-\nspondent to replace his fixed awning with retractable awning:  \n\u201cthis Board is of the view that it is far too late in the day for the Applicant to seek \nthis order. An argument for review may possibly be made if the MC had prescribed \nfixed awnings instead of retractable awnings before  a subsidiary proprietor had \nacted on  the MC \u2019s prescription. However, matters assume a different complexion \nwhen a subsidiary proprietor had acted on the MC \u2019s representation. There must be \nsome finality to the MC \u2019s everyday decisions. In other words, the policy of finality \nof the MC \u2019s decisio n is overriding in the present case \u201d. \nApplication of the Law to the Facts  on the Awnings on the Ground Floor  \n18. It is undisputed that 90 % approval for the fixed awnings was never obtained at various \nAnnual General Meeting s.  Nevertheless, we are satisfied that the Respondent ha s shown that \nthere was a \u201ckiller \u201d litter problem  before the fixed awnings were  installed .   \n19. The evidence shows that some of the subsidiary proprietors had applied to the Urban \nRedevelopment Authority  (\u201cURA \u201d) to install the fixed awnings through their contractor,  \n  \nLee Soh Geok  v The MCST Plan No. 4417               STB No. 88 of 2019  (Citylife@Tampines )\n  \nPage 11 of 21 \n Spacedor Marketing Pte Ltd. The Urban Redevelopment Authority granted planning \npermission to Spacedor Marketing Pte Ltd to install the se awnings on 7 July 2016.    However, \nit seems that the installation of the awnings was initially stopped by the developers.  This is \nfound in an email from Javen Lim to inter alia the developer on August 1, 2016 where he \nwrote : \n\u201cI am one of the PES unit owners staying at Blk 55 #XXX.  I would like to respond \nto your recent decision of stopping us from building our own roof extension.  We \nhave: - \n1) About 35 photos of killer litters (sic) that hit directly at our PES today and \nthis is NOT even the complete lis t. \n2) 4 videos of specifi c units having their workers, maids, family members, kids \nthrowing things, sweeping dirt down from their house which directly impact us.  \n3) Past email correspondences, text messages, witnesses from verbal \ncommunications between us and Developer/Management over the roof extension  \n\u2026I can flood everyone with the photos and videos that I have on hand.  I am doing \nthis for my family.  When it comes to safety for (sic) my family, I will NOT backed \n(sic) down \u201d3 \n20. In Javen Lim \u2019s email dated August 1, 2016, he alleged that the developer had previously \ngiven the approval to install the awnings.  He wrote:  \n\u201cWe sincerely hope that Developer/Management can HONOR(sic) your approval \nand let us proceed \u2026I will attached (sic)  some photos and videos that I have for you \nto support us and HONOR (sic) your approval \u201d.  \n21. In another email written by Bruce Lee to the developer dated August 20, 2016, Mr Lee wrote:  \n\u201cI heard a bang sound on my roof extension awhile and a long metal piece landed \non the common area as attached.  Subsequently the same domestic helper of the \nsame unit at level 4 came to retrieve it.  I checked with her about the dropped water \nbottle yesterday \u2026.\u201d4 \n22. These are only two instances of the problem of \u2018killer \u2019 litter highlighted by the subsidiary \nproprietors.  There are other emails by  Joannes Lee dated May 10, 2016,  Lily Low dated \nAugust 6, 2016,5 Fabian Foo dated August 10, 2016,6 Daniel Chen dated May 10, 20167 and \nSzeyun dated June 16, 20168 complaining abo ut the \u2018killer \u2019 litter problem.   \n \n                                                           \n3 Affidavit of Evidence -in-Chief of Lee Seng Leong at page 19  \n4 Affidavit of Evidence -in-Chief of Lee Seng Leong at page 29.  \n5 Affidavit of Evidence -in-Chief of Lee Seng Leong at page 34.  \n6 Affidavit of Evidence -in-Chief of Lee Seng Leong at page 35.  \n7 Affidavit of Evidence -in-Chief of Lee Seng Leong at page 37.  \n8 Affidavit of Evidence -in-Chief of Lee Seng Leong at page 38.   \n  \nLee Soh Geok  v The MCST Plan No. 4417               STB No. 88 of 2019  (Citylife@Tampines )\n  \nPage 12 of 21 \n 23. Joannes Lee wrote to the developer on May 10, 2016:  \n\u201cAt about 10.30 am or thereabouts, the plaster ceiling workmen heard a loud thud \nand informed me.  \nTo my astonishment, I found this sharp cut aluminium channel on my front Patio \nsteps \u2026Thank God no one was hit/injured by it .\u201d9 \n24. Lily Low wrote on August 6, 2016:  \n\u201cIt has come to my attention that a piece of \u201cmetal stick \u201d fell into the uncovered \nPES of my neighbour at Blk 57 #XXX this morning.  There was ongoing renovation \nworks of the upper level units.  Can you imaging the consequences if the metal piece \nhit and pierce someone. \u201d10 \n25. Fabian Foo wrote on Augus t 10, 2016:  \n\u201cPlease advise me who is going to be responsible for my family and our \nneighbors \u2019(sic) family lives, if something drop onto them at the open space patio \nagain \u2026Are you waiting for bloody injuries or eve n death in the patio before making \nthe final decision? \u201d11 \n26. It appears that the developer had approved the installation of the awnings for some of the \nsubsidiary proprietors.  For example , in an email sent from Szeyun  to the developer dated \nJune 16, 2016, she wrote:  \n\u201cYesterday Kevin at #XXX found a piece of broken wood chip with nails attached \nthat had fallen onto our trellis cover.  A photo is attached \u2026. \n\u2026If we did not have this trellis cover, the wood chip might ha ve seriously injured \nmy family who might have been outside right under the trellis.  \nTherefore I would also like to thank the management who acted fast and approved \nof our request to install a trellis cover.  If it took longer, someone would already \nhave b een injured.  My trellis was only erected less than 2 weeks. \u201d \n27. There is also evidence that the developer gave approval for the installation of the  awnings \nand prescribed the structure which ought to be installed  in the form of an  email from the \naddress info@citylifeattampines.com  to \u2018william zhang \u2019 dated 22 August 2016.   However, it \nshould be noted that in the same email, it was written in point 7 of the email:  \n\u201cIf the Management Corporation (when formed) decides that they are not \nagreeable to the PES Cover, you shall remove the said PES Cover at your own cost \nand expense \u201d. \n \n                                                           \n9 Affidavit of Evidence -in-Chief of Lee Seng Leong at page  37. \n10 Affidavit of Evidence -in-Chief of Lee Seng Leong at page 34.  \n11 Affidavit of Evidence -in-Chief of Lee Seng Leong at page 35.   \n  \nLee Soh Geok  v The MCST Plan No. 4417               STB No. 88 of 2019  (Citylife@Tampines )\n  \nPage 13 of 21 \n 28. In the present case, the Respondent as the Management Corporation is not insisting on the \nawnings to be removed. The Respondent \u2019s position is that all twenty -four fixed awnings at \nthe private enclosed spaces were installed in 2016 by the owners before the Respondent as \nthe Managing Corporation was even constituted  on 20 April 2017 .  Section 2 of the BSMSA \nprovides:  \n\u201cinitial period\u201d, in relation to a management corporation or subsidiary management \ncorporation, means a period starting from the day on which th e management corporation \nor subsidiary management corporation, as the case may be, is constituted (except pursu-\nant to a comprehensive resolution under section  78(2)(b)) and ending  \u2014 \n(a) 12 months later; or  \n(b) on the day when the first annual general meeting of the management corpo-\nration or (as the case may be) subsidiary management corporation is held, \nwhichever first occurs\u201d  \nThus, section 49(1) of the BSMSA is not engaged  because this  section  deals with restrictions \nof the manag ement  corporation \u2019s power during the initial period  when the management \ncorporation was formed  on 20 April 2017 .  In the present case, the awnings were installed \nprior to the formation of the management corporation.  This position is maintained in the \nRespondent \u2019s Closing Submissions and at the trial.12     As shown above, this position  is \nsupported by the evidence before us.   \n29. Thus, the present case raises the tricky issue on works done prior to the formation of the \nmanagement corporation.  In other words, h ow should the installation of awnings be analysed \nprior to the formation of the managing corporation?   Judith Prakash succinctly  explains  in \nChoo Kok Lin and another v Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 24 05 [2005] 4 \nSLR(R) 175  at [28] \u2013 [29] on the nature of works done prior to the formation of the \nmanagement corporation as follows:  \n\u201c\u2026in my judgment, the by -laws in this case would only have taken effect on 7 April \n2000  when the strata title plan for Kentish Lodge was registered and the MCST \ncame into existence \u2026This interpretation also  accords with common sense as the \ntwo by -laws alleged to have been breached are by -laws that  provide that subsidiary \nproprietors must obtain the approval of the MCST befo re carrying out the  types of \nworks specified in those by -laws. The appellants were not subsidiary proprietors \nwhen they  did the works and there was no MCST to whom they could have applied \nfor approval. The foregoing does not mean that prior to 7 April 2000  the appellants \nor other purchasers of  units in Kentish Lodge were entirely free to do whatever they \nliked with their units. In the sale and  purchase agreement that the appellants made \nwith the developer, there was a clause (cl 21) that  bound the appellant s to comply \n                                                           \n12 See Transcript Friday, 20 March 2020 on page 32.  Counsel stated at line 14 \u201cIt\u2019s before the initial period, it \u2019s in \n2016, the MCST was constituted in 2017.  \u201cInitial period \u201d has a technical meaning, it doesn \u2019t just mean the period \nbefore the 1st AGM.  It refers to the period ---\"  \n  \nLee Soh Geok  v The MCST Plan No. 4417               STB No. 88 of 2019  (Citylife@Tampines )\n  \nPage 14 of 21 \n with the restrictions in Schedule A to the sale agreement from the  date they took \npossession of the units until the MCST took over management of the condominium.  \nSchedule A contained restrictions that were similar to the by -laws set out in the \nFirst Schedule of the  Act. In particular, cl 2(m) of Schedule A provided that the \npurchaser was not to \u201cmark, paint, drive  nails or screws or the like into, or \notherwise damage or deface any structure that forms part of the  common property \nwithout the appr oval in writing of the [developer] \u201d. The developer could, therefore,  \nhave forbidden the appellants to carry out any erections or installations that would \nhave damaged or  defaced the common property. When the developer received the \nappellants \u2019 request for a pproval of  their intended works, the developer chose to sit \non the fence and decline either to approve or  specifically disapprove the works. If \nthe developer had rejected the works outright, the appellants  would not be in their \npresent position. In any case, even if the appellants were in breach of contract  \nbecause they did not get specific approval from the developer before proceeding \nwith their works,  that breach could only be acted on by the developer and the MCST \ncould not have relied on it in its  action before the district judge. Breach of the \nappellants \u2019 contractual obligations under the sale and  purchase agreement could \nnot be considered breach of the by -laws as those were not in force at the  time the \nacts constituting the breach took place \u201d. \n30. There fore, following from Choo Kok Lin, the owners who installed the works prior to the \nformation of the management corporation \u201cwere not subsidiary proprietors when they did the \nworks and there was no MCST to whom they could have applied for approval \u201d.  If the y \ninstalled the works without the developer \u2019s consent, this might have put them in breach of \ntheir sale and purchase contract with the developer.  However, even if they were in breach of \ncontract, the Respondent as the Management Corporation could not rely  on this breach of \ncontract because it was not privy to the sale and purchase agreement.   We note in this case \nthat we have seen evidence of approval of the installation of the awnings with respect of some \nof the units  by the developers .  \n31. The next question is this: whether the awnings must be taken down w hen the Management \nCorporation was formed on 20 April 2017  because  a 90 % resolution pursuant to section \n33(1)(c) of the BMSMA  was not obtained?  As explained above, section 33 of the BMSMA  \nis subject to section 32(2) of the BMSMA.  In other words, any by -laws made pursuant to \nsection 33 may not be inconsistent with the statutory by -laws.  Since the statutory by -law, \nnamely by -law 5(3)(d) does not prevent a subsidiary proprietor from install ing \u201cany structure \nor device to prevent harm to children \u201d, we are of the opinion that the ground floor units may \nmaintain the awnings due to the problem of \u201ckiller \u201d litter.  \n32. Finally, we are of the opinion that it would be disproportionate to ask the ground floor \nsubsidiary proprietors to remove the fixed awnings and replace them with retractable awnings \ngiven that the awnings have been installed since 2016.  As the Board said in the \nSuites@Newton  [2019] SGSTB 5  at 46 in the context of an Applicant seeking a Respondent  \n  \nLee Soh Geok  v The MCST Plan No. 4417               STB No. 88 of 2019  (Citylife@Tampines )\n  \nPage 15 of 21 \n to replace his fixed awning with retractable awning:  \u201c[a]n argument for review may possibly \nbe made if the MC had prescribed fixed awnings instead of retractable awnings \u201d.  In the \npresent case, it would be entirely disproportionate to ask the ground floor units to remove the  \nfixed  awnings which been installed since 2016  and replace them with retractable awnings  in \nresponse to a \u201ckiller \u201d litter problem.  \n33. We note that at the trial there was some reference to penthouse units which have fixed \nawnings.  This was not something which was pursued by the Applicant in her initial \napplication in Form 8 which refers to awnings causing problems for subsidiary proprietors \nwho live on the upper floors.  The re ference to problems caused to subsidiary proprietors in \nthe upper floors is repeated in the Applicant\u2019s closing submission .  We find that it would be \nunfair to pursue an application against the penthouse units  in the present case  because to do \nso would be tantamount to taking the Respondent by surprise.  The Respondent had \nproceeded with the current application on the basis that the issue was against the ground floor \nunits and had not prepared the necessary evidence in relation the penthouse units.   We dec line \nto say anymore in relation to the penthouse units.  \n34. Therefore, we dismiss the Applicant\u2019s prayer for the Board to make an order for the fixed \nawnings to be removed and replaced with retractable awnings.  \nGuidelines for Cleaning of Awnings  \n35. The Applicant has also asked the Board t o inter alia  state the frequency  of when  retractable \nawnings  (when installed)  should be  replaced, cleaned and prescribe the method of cleaning.  \nIn addition, the Applicant has also invited the Board to apportion the clea ning cost s to be \nborne by the respective subsidiary proprietors to be made payable to the Respondent \nautomatically as additional maintenance fees.  \n36. We decline to make this order as we are of the view that the Board\u2019s role is not to \nmicromanage the running of strata developments  (see Ker Lee Ping v MCST Plan No. 3822 \n[2017] SGSTB 6) .  Furthermore, there is no power in the statute to levy additional \nmaintenance fees on the affected subsidiary proprietors  in such circumstances.    \nRemoval of Water Pipes  Installed Along Common Property  \n37. The Applicant seeks an order that the Respondent remove the water pipes which had been \ninstalled along common property walls which serve  21 ground floor units.  \n38. The Respondent\u2019s position is that 18 units had verbal approval by a lady named Joyce who \nwas the manager in 2016 to install the water pipes.  Presumably, Joyce was working for the \ndeveloper and the pipes were installed before the Management Corporation was  constituted.  \nUnfortunately, the Respondent does not have a comprehensive record of the approval in \nrelation to these water pipes.  \n  \n  \nLee Soh Geok  v The MCST Plan No. 4417               STB No. 88 of 2019  (Citylife@Tampines )\n  \nPage 16 of 21 \n 39. Like the fixed awnings, these water pipes were installed before the formation of the \nmanagement corporation. It is undispu ted that  after the formation of the management \ncorporation,  a 90 % resolution was not obtained in relation to the se water pipes.  As \nmentioned above, section 33(1)(c) of the BMSMA stipulates that a 90% resolution is required \nto make by -laws conferring on subsidiary proprietors the exclusive use and enjoyment of or \nspecial privileges in respect of the whole or any part of common property exceeding three \nyears.   Since these water pipes traverse over common property, they could properly be \nchara cterised as giving the affected subsidiary proprietors special privileges in respect of part \nof the common property.  Unlike the  fixed  awnings, no safety considerati ons are  associated \nwith the se water pipes.  Thus, by-law 5(3)  is not engaged and the by -law does not  operate to  \nallow the subsidiary proprietors to maintain these pipes.  \n40. We therefore order the Respondent to  take the necessary steps to remove the water pipes \nwithin 6 months of this judgment.  If within this period of 6 months, the necessary resol ution \nof 90 % is obtained then removal of the pipes will not be necessary.     \nUnauthorised Pots, Plants, Bicycles and CCTV on Common Property  \n41. The Applicant ha s asked the Board to order  the Respondent to remove unauthorised pots, \nplants and bicycles and CCTV placed on the common property  by subsidiary proprietors .  \nFurther , the Applicant has asked the Board to order the Respondent to fine  offending  \nsubsidiary proprietors.   \n42. The Responden t\u2019s position is that it has done its best to ask the subsidiary proprietors to \nremove the unauthorized items on common property.   When the Applicant made complaints, \nthe Respondent managed to get the subsidiary proprietors to clear those offending items.   \nUnfortunately, the subsidiary proprietors will then start put ting these items out again.  The \nManaging Agent \u2019s Residential Manager, Muhammad Hashim Bin Lazim, has given evidence \nthat the Respondent will act again whe n necessary.13  Therefore, w e decline to make any \norders  in relation to this claim .  As stated above, it is not the role of the Board to micromanage  \nthe minutiae and day to day operations of  a strata development.  \n43. We also decline to order the Respondent to impose fines against offendin g subsidiary \nproprietors.  This claim is misconceived as m anagement corporations do not have the \nstatutory powers to impose fines upon subsidiary proprietors for breaches of by -laws (see \nManagement Corporation Strata Title Plan No 2746 v Boon Kee Battery S ervice [2012] \nSGSTB 2).  \nOrdering the Patio Units to Pay for Cleaning Cost of their Awnings  \n44. The Applicant has requested that the Board order the subsidiary proprietors of the ground \nfloor units who have installed the fixed awnings to pay the Respondent $ 600 per unit per \n                                                           \n13 Affidavit of Muhammad Hashim Bin Lazim   \n  \nLee Soh Geok  v The MCST Plan No. 4417               STB No. 88 of 2019  (Citylife@Tampines )\n  \nPage 17 of 21 \n washing  of their awnings by the development \u2019s current cleaning contractor, P rimec Engrg \nPte Ltd . This complaint is premised on the fact that the  current cleaning contract with Primec \nEngrg Pte Ltd with the Respondent provides for free cleaning  services  of the fixed awnings \nof the subsidiary proprietors . Significantly, the Applican t is not seeking to challenge the \nvalidity of the cleaning contract.14  \n45. We decline to make the order sought by the Applicant .  First, while we find that the provision \nof free cleaning of private awnings  of subsidiary proprietors  unusual, the evidence before us \ndid not show that the Respondent had rejected a lower quote in favour of Primec Engrg Pte \nLtd.  Second, there is no provision in the statute that allows for the Respondent to levy extra \ncharges on the subsidiary proprietors  in these circumstances .  Finally, the affected subsidiary \nproprietors are not before this Board.  Hence, the Board cannot make an order against a non -\nparty to these proceedings  and levy an extra charge .    \n46. In the premises, we dismiss all the Applicant \u2019s claims save the complaint in relation to the \nwater pipes. For the water pipes, we order the Respondent to take the necessary action to \nremove the water pipes within 6 months of this judgment .   \n47. The Board having read the submi ssion on costs notes that t he Respondent has asked for costs \nof $18,000 plus disbursement if they are substantially successful in the proceedings. The \nApplicant whilst not stating the costs has asked that she be paid disbursement amount to \n$3426.80 .  \n48. The Applicant ha s failed substantially in the application and costs should follow the event . \nThe Board orders that the Applicant  pays the Respondent a sum of $9000  and bears the STB \nfee of S$450 (S$150 being fee for the 3rd mediation/ directions hearing on 4 F ebruary 2020 \nand S$300 being fee for the hearing on 20 March 2020) . Most of the issues should have been \nresolved at mediation but for the refusal of the Applicant. It would be unfair that no costs be \nordered against her on the ground of her public spirit i n commencing the action as all \nsubsidiary proprietors would be made to contribute to the costs of the legal defence of her \nclaim . \nDated this  7th day of September 2020  \n  _______________________  \nMr Alfonso Ang  \nPresident  \n_______________________  \nDr Tang Hang Wu  \nMember  \n                                                           \n14 Transcript of Hearing on 20 March 2020 page 91.   \n  \nLee Soh Geok  v The MCST Plan No. 4417               STB No. 88 of 2019  (Citylife@Tampines )\n  \nPage 18 of 21 \n Minority Opinion  (the \u201cOpinion \u201d): \nAs my Opinion is a minority one, I would state the Opinion briefly.  \nI agree with the Grounds of Decision of President Mr Alfonso Ang and fellow member Dr Tang \nHang Wu  (the \u201cMajority \u201d), of the Board, except the following:  \n(a) That it was not open to the Board to make a finding on the issue of fixed awnings installed \non the penthouses of the Development;  \n(b) That the Applicant \u2019s prayer 1 for the Board to make an order to remove the fixed awnings \ninstalled on the ground floors and p enthouses of the Development be dismissed ; and  \n(c) Costs.  \nI set out below the reasons for my disagreements.  \nJurisdiction Issue  \n1. I disagree with the view of the Majority that it would be unfair to pursue an application \nagainst the penthouse units as to do so wo uld be tantamount to taking the Respondent by \nsurprise.  \n2. At the trial, the Applicant was asked to clarify whether her prayer 1 would include fixed \nawnings installed on the penthouse units. She replied in the affirmative. She said that the \nreference to \u201cPES/RT\u201d in her prayer 1 would include fixed awnings installed on the pent-\nhouses. The Applicant and the witness for the Respondent, Mr Lee Seng Leong, then pro-\nceeded to give evidence on this issue, which was not controverted. In fact, they both agreed \nthat the  fixed awnings installed on the penthouses were installed on the common property \nwithout the necessary 90% resolution required under section 33(1)(c) of Building BMSMA \nbut that there was no concern about killer litter problem. The Counsel for the Responden t \ndid not raise any objection at the trial.   \n3. In the Sunglade  [2018] 4 SLR 966 at para graph  54, Chan Seng Onn J noted with approval \nthe decision of the TMM Division Martina SA  case that  \u201cthe court may consider not only \nthe pleadings and their contents, but also any issue that surfaces in the course of the arbi-\ntration and that  is known to all the parties to the arbitration, even if such issue has not been \npleaded. \u201d \n4. I therefore do not think the Board would be acting in excess of its jurisdiction by determining \nthe issue of fixed awnings installed on the penthouses.  \nInstallation of fixed awnings on the ground floors and penthouses  \n5. \u201cA man \u2019s home is his castle \u201d. Simila rly, the common property of a condominium, which is \nbeneficially owned by all the subsidiary proprietors (\u201cSPs\u201d) of the condominium, is the  \n  \nLee Soh Geok  v The MCST Plan No. 4417               STB No. 88 of 2019  (Citylife@Tampines )\n  \nPage 19 of 21 \n castle of the SPs . Any act which seeks to infringe or encroach on the common property has  \nto be explicitly authorise d under the BMSMA.  \n6. The BMSMA prescribes a statutory framework for the conferring on SPs the exclusive use \nand enjoyment of or special privileges in respect of the whole or any part of the common \nproperty in sections 49(1)(b), 33 and 101(6). The objective o f the framework is to protect \nthe common property from unlawful encroachment and to give to the SPs of a condominium \nthe right to determine by an appropriate resolution under section 33 (1) of BMSMA whether \nany proposed encroachment of the common property s hould be allowed.  \n7. Section 49(1)(b) prohibits a MCST during the Initial Period to alter any part of the common \nproperty or to erect any structure thereon unless it is authorised by a special resolution. I \nagree with the Majority that section 49(1)(b) is not  applicable to the present case.  \n8. Section 33(1)(c) stipulates that a 90% resolution is required to make by -laws conferring on \nSPs the exclusive use and enjoyment of or special privileges of the whole or part of the \ncommon property exceeding 3 years. It was  not disputed by the parties that the SPs of the \nDevelopment who installed fixed awnings on the ground floors and the penthouses did not \nobtain the 90% resolution.  \n9. In Wu Chiu Lin v MCST Plan no 2874(2018) 4 SLR, the Sunglade , Chan Seng Onn J at \nparagraph 45 cited with approval the observation of Prof Teo Keang Sood, Strata Title in \nSingapore and Malaysia  (LexisNexis, 5th Ed. 2015), that \u201cin view of the explicit requirements \nset out in section 33 for the conferment of exclusive use or special privileges in respect of \ncommon property, it follows that there is no other method to attain the same end .\u201d Chan J \nalso stated in the Sunglade at para graph  46 that he was also fortified by the outcome reached \nin the decision of Poh Kiong Kok v MCST Plan No  581(1990) I SLR(R) 617 that the parking \nscheme was of no legal effect unless a by -law was made pursuant to an unanimous resolution \nas mandated by section 41(8) of the Land Titles (Stata) Act, which corresponds to section \n33(1) of BMSMA. In other words, th ere was no way out: where the necessary 90% resolution \nas mandated under section 33(1)(c) was not obtained, the installation of the fixed awnings \non common property would be unauthorised and had to be removed. In the present case, as \nno 90% resolution was obtained for the installation of the fixed awnings on the ground floors \nand on the penthouses, such installations would contravene section 33(1)(c) and hence un-\nauthorised under the BMSMA.  \n10. The view of the Majority that regulation 5(3) of the BMSMR 2005 mad e under section 32(2) \nof the BMSMA overrides or provides an exception to section 33(1)(c) is, in my view, mis-\nconceived. It is trite law that any subsidiary legislation made under an Act which is incon-\nsistent with a provision of the Act would be ultra vires  and invalid (see  MCST Plan No 901 \nv Lian Tat Huat Trading Ltd  (2018) SGHC 270 at para graph  30).  \n  \nLee Soh Geok  v The MCST Plan No. 4417               STB No. 88 of 2019  (Citylife@Tampines )\n  \nPage 20 of 21 \n 11. Hence, if regulation 5(3) is intended to override or provide an exception to the requirement \nof the 90% resolution mandated under section 33(1)(c), it would be  ultra vires  and invalid. \nBut regulation 5(3) is, in my view, not so intended. It is a saving provision. It is intended to \nbe a shield and not a sword. It seeks to save any act prohibited under regulation 5(1) if such \nact is authorised by law. It is not in tended to create new rights or powers, such as a power to \noverride or provide an exception to section 33(1)(c).  \n12. The Respondent did not make any by -laws under section 33(1)(c) relating to the installation \nof fixed awnings on the ground floors and penthouses ; and rightly so, as obtaining the 90% \nresolution mandated thereunder was a pre -requisite to making the by -laws. Otherwise the \nRespondent would be putting the cart before the horse. Such by -laws are only a means for \nthe implementation of the 90% resolution  so obtained and not an end itself. Hence, the issue \nof regulation 5(3) overriding by -laws made under section 33(1)(c) does not arise.  \n13. I would therefore allow prayer 1 of the application and order the removal the fixed awnings \ninstalled on the ground floor s and penthouses of the Development. I order the Respondent \nto take the necessary steps to remove such fixed awnings within 6 months of this Judgment. \nIf within this period of 6 months, the necessary resolution of 90% is obtained, then removal \nof such awni ngs would not be necessary.  \n14. In the event that the resolution of 90% is not so obtained, I would suggest that the Respond-\nent considers obtaining a 90% resolution under section 33(1)(c) to install slanted retractable \nawnings as replacements for the fixed awn ings as proposed by the Applicant in her applica-\ntion. I note that in past cases decided by the Board, it was stated that retractable awnings \nwould be a necessary, reasonable and proportionate response to the SPs \u2019 safety concerns or \nthe killer litter proble m.  \n15. The Applicant also sought in her prayer 2 of the application an order from the Board to \nreplace such fixed awnings with slanted retractable awnings. I would decline to make such \nan order. Section 101(6) of BMSMA prohibits a Board to exercise its power to make any \norder under 101(1) where such power may only be exercised by a resolution under the \nBMSMA. The 90% resolution in section 33(1)(c) is such a resolution. Hence any order of \nthe Board made under section 101(1) in contravention of section 101(6) wo uld be ultra vires  \nand invalid. The intention of section 101(6) is to ensure that a Board does not, wittingly or \notherwise, make an order which would deprive the SPs of their rights to decide by a 90% \nresolution under section 33(1) whether or not to allow any SP to encroach on any part of the \ncommon property.  \n16. In my view the order of the Majority dismissing the said prayer 1 would implicitly contra-\nvene section 101(6). The order would be tantamount to the Board exercising a power pro-\nhibited by section 101(6) to allow the fixed awnings installed on the ground floo rs and on \nthe penthouses to be retained without the necessary 90% resolution mandated under section  \n  \nLee Soh Geok  v The MCST Plan No. 4417               STB No. 88 of 2019  (Citylife@Tampines )\n  \nPage 21 of 21 \n 33(1)(c). In my view this is wrong as section 33(1)(c) mandated that it is for the SPs, not the \nBoard, to decide by a 90% resolution whether or not to allow  such installation.  \nConclusion  \n17. I share the safety concerns of SPs living on the ground floors of the Development. The issue \nof installation of awnings had caused much resentment and disharmony not only in the De-\nvelopment but also in other condominiums in Singapore. But the solution is not for such SPs \nor the Respondent to take the law into their own hands but to comply with it or face the \nconsequences. The rights of such SPs to install fixed awnings for safety reasons have to be \nbalanced with the rights of  the overwhelming majority of SPs to use and   enjoy the common \nproperty which they beneficially own ed. Hence the due process prescribed under section \n33(1)(c) has to be complied with.  It should be borne in mind that where the necessary 90% \nresolution und er section 33(1)(c) is obtained by the SPs concerned to exclusively use and \nenjoy any part of the common property of the Development, the overwhelming majority of \nSPs of the Development would permanently forfeit their rights to the use and enjoyment of \nsuch common property.  \n18. The statutory framework stated in para graph  6 above is intended to strike such a balance. It \ndoes not provide any exception for safety measures. If it is deemed desirable to do so, it is \nfor Parliament, not the Board or the Respondent, to provide for such exception, like the issue \nof safety equipment which is now regulated under new section 37A of BMSMA enacted in \n2019.  \nCosts  \n19. I would not make an order on costs. In my view, the application of the Applicant is \nmeritorious. In my Opinion , she has succeeded in her primary prayers 1 and 3 for the removal \nof the unauthorised fixed awnings installed on the ground floors and penthouses and the \nwater pipes installed along the common property. Her public spiritedness in bringing the \nappli cation and arguing her case in person before the Board to redress what she believed or \nperceived to be mismanagement by the management of the Development are in my view \nmost commendable . \nDated this  7th day of September 2020 \n_______________________  \nMr Ter K im Cheu  \n   Member  \n \n \nMs Lee Soh Geok (in -person) for the Applicant . \nMr Daniel Chen (M/s Lee & Lee) for the Respondent .

All were resolved before this arbitration hearing except the p arking issues  and costs .  \n5. In this hearing , the Applicant  sought the following three  (3) orders :  \ni. The Respo ndent to wheel clamp and tow away any vehicle found parking at non-\ndesignated parking spaces within the condominium property .  \nii. The Respondent to enforce pa yment  by the owner and/or driver of the offending  vehicle (s) \nof: Supersonic Maintenance Services Pte Ltd v The MCST 3564   STB No.  86 of 2019 \u2013 WCEGA Plaza & Tower   \n \n4 \n a) an administrative fee of $100 for the release of wheel clamp together with a parking \nfee of $50 a d ay or any part thereof, such fees to be paid in full in cash  together with \nthe prevailing Goods and Services Tax before the wheel  clamp is released ; or \n \nb) an administrative fee of $300 together with a parking fee of $50 a day o r any  part \nthereof, the towing, storage and connected charges at the prevailing Goods and \nServices Tax for the vehicle towed away.  \n \niii. The Respondent pays the Applicant\u2019s costs of this application.  \n \n6. These orders sought were extract s from Para graphs ( 4 ) & (6) of the Additional by-law on Car \nParking  Management of the Development passed sometime in 2013 . Paragraphs  (4) & (6) of \nthe by -laws are as follows : \n\u201c(4) That vehicles found parking at non -designated parking spaces within the common \nproperty of the Management Corporation be wheel clamped or towed away.  \n\u2026.. \n(6) The owner and/or driver of the offending vehicle shall pay the Management \nCorporation:  \n(A) An administrative fee of S$100.00 for the release of the wheel clamp together with a \nparking fee of S$50.00 a day or any part thereof, such fees to be paid in full in cash together \nwith the prevailing Goods and Services Tax before the wheel clamp is released;  \n(B) An administrative fee of S$300.00 together with a parking fee of S$50.00 a day or any \npart t hereof, the towing, storage  and connected charges and the prevailing Goods and \nServices Tax for the vehicle towed away. \u201d \n \n7. The Applican t is asking the Board to make the orders unde r Section 101 ( 1)(c) of the \nBMSMA. Sect ion 101(1)(c) provides as follows : - \n101(1) \u2013 Subject to subsections  (4), (6) and (7), a Board may, pursuant to an application \nby a management corporation or subsidiary management corporation, a subsidiary \nproprietor, mortgagee in possession, lessee or occupier of a lot in a subdivided buildi ng, \nmake an order for the settlement of a dispute, or the rectification of a complaint, with \nrespect to  \u2014 \n\u2026.. \n(c) the exercise or performance of, or the failure to exercise or perform, a power, duty or \nfunction conferred or imposed by this Act or the by -laws relating to the subdivided building \nor limited common property, as the case may be.  \n \nAPPLICANT \u2019S CASE  \n \n8. As early as Jan 2019 or even earlier, the Applicant noticed that many vehicles were being \nparked illegally at various locations in the Development. The location s and the  large  number \nof vehicle s involve d, caused serious safety  issues  and dangers to SPs and their employe es. He \nwrote  to the Responde nt on several  occasion s reporting on the parking situation . The \nApplicant said the Respondent wrote  to say they would step up daily  inspection s and take  \nenforcement  actions when necessary and would continue to do its best to ensure compliance \nof the applicable laws and by -laws.  \n \n9. The Applicant said that there was little or no improvement to the illegal parking problem , \nwhich  remain ed unresolved.  \n \n10. The Applicant then filed this application with the STB.  \n Supersonic Maintenance Services Pte Ltd v The MCST 3564   STB No.  86 of 2019 \u2013 WCEGA Plaza & Tower   \n \n5 \n 11. The Applicant alleged that the Respondent failed t o enforce the parking by -laws, and in \nparticular, the Respondent\u2019s enforcement of the parking by -laws was lacking and inadequate, \nand that that there are serious safety concerns from the extent of the illegal parking in the \nDevelopment. This includes carpark ramps, traffic lanes, outside units in the Development \nand many common areas which are not demarcated for parking.  \n \n12. The Applicant further alleged that after he had file d the application  with the STB, on 11 \nDecember 2019, the Respondent tar geted him and selectively enforced the parking by-law \nagainst him by clamping and towing his vehicle away, despite there being allegedly many \nother vehicles parked in the same area . \n \nRESPONDENT \u2019S CASE  \n \n13. The Respondent denies the Applicant\u2019s allegations that it has not been enforcing the parking \nby-laws.  The parking by -laws had been in existence for six (6) years and there were no \nobjections from the Applicant before this.  \n \n14. The Respondent \u2019s operations manager, Lim Huang Jie and the complex man ager, Lim Yong \nHeng  both testified that they have been enforcing the parking by-laws complained of by the \nApplicant.   \n \n15. They submitted a security deployment table showing how the security officers were deployed \nin patrolling the Development and looking out for offending vehicle s. \n \n16. They also submitted the records of the number of vehicles clamped and the amount of fees \npaid by th ese offending vehicle \u2019s owner/driver.  \n \n17. They also testified that they have a standard operating procedure (SOP) for the g uidance of \nthe security officers , as follows:   \n\u201cSOP for Parking Violations  \n1. Obstruction - Tow awa y immediately.  \n2. Non-obstruction - Serve warning letter (white colour) \u2013 20 minutes allowance.  \n3. Serve final a warning letter (red colour) - 20 minutes allowance thereafter to wheel clamp.  \n4. Vehicle will be tow away if owner did not made payment of wheel clam fee after 3 days \nfrom the date of the wheel clamping. Parking fee of $50.00 per day apply.  \n5. After office hours \u2013 all violation charges & fee will be handled by the security with proper \nrecords and receipts. To hand over to management office the following working day.  \n \nSOP for Obstruction by Heavy Vehicles & Container  \n1. Serve warning letter \u2013 24 hours to remove  \n2. Clamp/tow to temporary sto rage pending disposal after 3 days.  \n3. Clamp release fee of $107.00 (include 7% GST), towing charges of $321.00 (include 7% \nGST) and daily storage fee is applicable.  \n4. All charges will be reimbursed from owner. \u201d \n \n18. The development is also large , consisting of some ten (10) floors , with more than nine hundred \n(900) SPs . They deployed their officer s the best they could to enforce the parking by-laws.  \nThe Development also owns sixteen (16) wheel clamps and used all of them frequently.   \n \n19. The 11 Decem ber 2019  incident cited by the Applicant for towing away his vehicles was \nexceptional. It is not disputed that the vehicle was parked in a undesignated parking lot in \nbreach of the Additional By -law on parking. The vehicle was suspected of carrying a toxic  Supersonic Maintenance Services Pte Ltd v The MCST 3564   STB No.  86 of 2019 \u2013 WCEGA Plaza & Tower   \n \n6 \n substance , and the Applicant had indicated that he would  not remove the vehicle . Hence, the \nRespondent towed the vehicle away.   \n \n20. Both the Operation  Manager  and the Complex Manager also said that in implementing the \nSOP, the enforcement officers were given some flexibility and discretion. Both denied the \nApplicant\u2019s allegation of selective enforcement by their officers.  \n \nBOARD\u2019S FINDINGS  \n21. The control management and administration of the use of common properties (including \nparking) is within the purview of the management corporation ( see Sections 29 and 32) of the \nBMSMA. This would include the day-to-day management, such as the protocol and procedure \nused to carry out its duty.  \n \n22. The Board is of the view that in the absence of any evidence of discrimination, unfair practice \nor other unlawful acts against any SPs, the Board would not intervene.  \n \n23. Both the Respondent \u2019s Operations M anager and Complex Manager testified that the by -laws \nwere being enforced. This was supported by the documents they submitted, especially  the \nrecord s of the num ber of vehicle clamped and the fees collected. The Board, on all the \nevidence adduced before  it,  finds that the Respondent had been enforcing the parking by-\nlaws complained of by the Applicant , albeit, not to the subjective expectation of the Applicant.  \n \n24. The Board find s the SOP implemented by the Respondent  reasonable , and that it is not lacking \nor inadequate. The Board also notes that the Applicant does not object to the SOP.  \n \n25. In enforcement actions, it is the Board\u2019s view, that it is reasonable to give these  enforcement \nofficers some degree of flexibility and discretion in following the SOP so long as there is no \nabuse, i mpartiality or discrimination.  \n \n26. The Board is not satisfied  on the evid ence before it that there were any oppressive or \nunreasonable actions taken by the officers of the Respondent against the Applicant.

The \nApplicant is also claiming for reimbursements for repairs he had done to those places.  \n \n2 The Applicant\u2019s claims filed with the Strata Titles Board (\u201cthe Board\u201d) are stated as \nfollows:  \n \n\u201cIt is the responsibility of the Respondent to: - \n \n(a) Maintain and repair the roof of the townhouse . \n  Raman Dhir  v The MCST Plan No. 1374              STB No. 8 of 2019 ( The Balmoral ) \nPage 3 of 7 \n (b) Make all external walls waterproof  \n \n(c) Look after and maintain the glass awning  \n \n(d) Reimburse the Application for repairs done including external ceiling and \ntermites treatment  \n \n(e) Reimburse expenses etc. including Small Claims Tribunal costs  [of] \n$5,000 which includes travel costs from London. \u201d \n \n3 The Applicant\u2019s allegation was that the damages to his unit were all caused by water \nseepages from the common areas i.e the RC flat roof, the Fixed Window Panels and the \nPolycarbonate Awning located in his unit.  \n \n4 At the first hearing, the Board f ound that the Fixed Window Panels were common \nproperty but the RC Flat Roof and the Polycarbonate Awning were not. The Applicant\u2019s \nclaims for damages and reimbursements were dismissed.  \n \n5 On appeal, the High Court found that the RC Flat Roof and the Polycarbonate Awning \nare common properties. The High Court ordered a rehearing and reconsideration with the \nfollowing direction:  \n \n\u201c\u2026 the STB is to consider the application of the presumption under s 101(8) of the \nBMSMA in coming to its decision on Mr Dhir\u2019 s claim based on the evidence placed \nbefore the STB. \u201d1 \n \n \nSECTION 101(8) \u2013 THE PRESUMPTION  \n \n \n6 Section 101(8) of the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act (Cap. 30C, 2008 \nRev Ed) (\u201cBMSMA\u201d) provides as follows:  \n \n\u201c(8) In any proceedings under this section with respect to any alleged defect \nin a lot or in any common property or limited common property situated \nimmediately (whether wholly or partly) above another lot or any common \nproperty or limited common property,  it shall be presumed, in the absence \nof proof to the contrary, that the defect is within that lot or common property \nor limited common property, as the case may be, above if there is any \nevidence of dampness, moisture or water penetration -  \n \n(a) on the ceiling that forms part of the interior of the lot, common \nproperty or limited common property, as the case may be, \n                                                        \n1 Raman Dhir v MCST Plan No 1374 [2020] SGHC 19, at para 57.  Raman Dhir  v The MCST Plan No. 1374              STB No. 8 of 2019 ( The Balmoral ) \nPage 4 of 7 \n immediately below; or  \n \n(b) on any finishing material (including plaster, panel or gypsum \nboard) attached, glued, laid or applied to the ceiling that forms \npart of the interior of the lot, common property or limited \ncommon property, as the case may be, immediately below.\u201d  \n \n \n7 At the Parliamentary Debate in 2004 under the heading \u201c Statutory presumption of \nliability for inter-floor leakages \u201d, it was stated that \u201c \u2026 the Committee is agreeable to the \nproposal that \u2026 attributes a rebuttable presumption of liability to the upper floor unit \nowner for such cases that are handled by the STB\u2026 \u201d and \u201c\u2026 this presumption of liability \nwill make upper floor u nit owners more responsive to lower unit owners\u2026 \u201d.2  \n \n8 Clearly, the intention of the presumption under s 101(8) is for the resolving of inter-floor  \nleakages more expeditiously.  \n \n \nIS SECTION 101(8) APPLICA BLE  TO THE RC FLAT ROOF  \n \n \n9 Although the presumption is intended for inter-floor  leakages, on a plain reading of the \nsection, the Board is of the view that it may be  applicable to  a situation such as  the RC \nFlat Roof .  \n \n10 However, in respect of the evidence of dampness , moisture  or water penetration on the \nceiling of the inter ior of the RC Flat Roof immediately below, the only evidence produced \nby the Applicant was his own allegation. He produced no photographs and reports in  \nsupport.  \n \n11 The Board notes that for all the oth er various damages, the Applicant had produced \nphotographs and reports in support. The photographs produced by the Applicant \npurportedly showing the ceiling of the RC Flat Roof was actually the ceiling of the \nbedroom/bathroom situated at the 3rd storey of his unit directly below not the RC Flat \nRoof but the fourth storey. The  4th  storey is a concrete open roof deck which is the private \nproperty of the Applicant..  \n \n12 There is the evidence of a witness called Kalai, the development\u2019s Condominium \nManager. He st ated that at a joint inspection on 22 June 2018, he did not see any sign of \nwater seepages at the \u201c4th level enclosed area\u201d. This would be directly below the RC Flat \nRoof ceiling.  \n \n13 The Applicant claimed that he had painted the ceiling of the RC Flat Roof w hen Kalai \n                                                        \n2 Respondent\u2019s Written Submissions, Annex B, at columns 931 to 932.  Raman Dhir  v The MCST Plan No. 1374              STB No. 8 of 2019 ( The Balmoral ) \nPage 5 of 7 \n said he did not see any sign of seepages. The Board notes that at the time of the joint \ninspection, the water ponding  on top of the RC Flat Roof complained of by the Applicant \nhad not been repaired. It was repaired by the Applicant some six month s or so after the \njoint inspection. To paint over the damaged ceiling  before the water ponding was  repair ed \ndid not seem credible.  \n \n14 On a balance of probabilit ies based on the evidence placed before the Board, it finds that \nall the condition s of s 101 (8) were  not satisfied.  \n \n15 The presumption under s 101 (8) is therefore not applicable to the RC Flat Roof in the \ncircumstance s of this case.  \n \n \nIS SECTION 101(8) APPLICABLE TO THE POLYCARBONATE AWNING  \n \n \n16 On a plain reading of s 101 (8), the Board is of the view that this section is not applicable \nnor is it intended to be applicable to a n architectural  feature  like a polycarbonate awning \ncovering the private area of the Applicant\u2019s unit. The intent of the presumption is for the \ninter-floor  leakages previously stated . \n \n \nIS SECTION 101(8) APPLICABLE TO THE FIXED WINDOW PANELS  \n \n \n17 On a plain reading of this section, it does not apply to lateral seepages i.e. through \nwindows or walls.  \n \n18 The Board is therefore of the view that s 101 (8) is not applicable to the Fixed Window \nPanels in this case.   \n \n \nFINDINGS  \n \n \n19 The Board finds that s 101 (8) is not applicable to the RC Flat Roof, the Fixed Window \nPanels and the Polycarbonate Awning.  \n \n20 On the evidence placed before the Board, it is unable , on a balance of probabilit ies, to \nmake a finding that the various leakages in the Applicant\u2019s unit that caused all the alleged \ndamages originated from the three areas i.e. the RC Flat Roof, the Fixed Window Panels \nand the Polycarbonate Awning.  \n \n21 However, the Board finds that there were  evidence of water ponding  on the RC Flat Roof  \nand some leakages in  the Polycarbonate Awning. A s these structure /feature  were found Raman Dhir  v The MCST Plan No. 1374              STB No. 8 of 2019 ( The Balmoral ) \nPage 6 of 7 \n to be common properties, any repairs to the defects will have to be borne by the \nRespondent.  \n \n22 The Board finds that because of some disagreements between the Applicant and the \nRespondent causing some delays, the Applicant had little choice but to proceed to repair \nthe defects at his own cost. The Respondent cannot now quibble over the amou nts \nactually paid by the Applicant for these repairs.  \n \n \nTHE BOARD\u2019S ORDERS  \n \n \n23 The Board orders as follows: - \n \n(1) The Respondent will reimburse the Applicant a sum of $11,080 for the repairs done \nto the RC Flat Roof  upon production of official receipt(s) of actual amount  paid.  \n \n(2) The Respondent will reimburse the Applicant a sum of $4,900 for repair done on the \nAwning  upon production of official receipt (s) of actual amount paid.  \n \n(3) Any repairs to the Fixed Window Panels will be paid by the Respondent . \n \n(4) The Applicant\u2019s claims for damages are dismissed.  \n \n \nCOSTS  \n \n \n24 At the first hearing, the Applicant was successful in his claim that the Fixed Window \nPanels was  common propert y.  On appeal, the High Court ruled that the RC Flat Roof \nand the Polycarbonate Awning were also common properties. The Applicant did not \nsucceed in his claims for damages.  \n \n25 In the rehearing/reconsideration ordered by the High Court, the Applicant was succes sful \nin the reimbursement of the of the sums he had paid out for rectifying the defects at the \ncommon properties but did not succeed again in his claims  for damages .  \n \n26 The Board is of the view that it will be just and reasonable to order that each party pa y \nits own costs both at the first hearing and the re -hearing. As for the interlocutory hearing, \nthe Applicant has submitted that a fixed sum of $750 be paid to the Respondent. The \nBoard is of the view that this is reasonable.    \n \n \n \n Raman Dhir  v The MCST Plan No. 1374              STB No. 8 of 2019 ( The Balmoral ) \nPage 7 of 7 \n ORDER ON COSTS  \n \n27 The Board orders as follows: - \n \n(1) Each party pays its own costs for both the first hearing and the re -hearing.  \n \n(2) The Applicant to pay the Respondent a sum of $750 for the interlocutory hearing.  \n \n \nDated this 29th day of July 2020  \n \n \n \n \n           _________________________  \n           Mr. Seng Kwang Boon   \n           Deputy President  \n \n \n \n           _________________________  \n           Mr. Kong Mun Kwong   \n           Member  \n \n \n \n           _________________________  \n           Mr. Tony Tay Chye Teck   \n           Member  \n \n \n \n \n \nMs. Carolyn Tan Beng Hui (M/s Tan & Au LLP ) for the \nApplicant . \n \nMs. Hui Choon Wai  (M/s  Wee Swee Teow LLP ) for the \nRespondent . \n \n \n "

This is an application by two subsidiary proprietors of Pine Grove Condominium \n(MCST Plan No. 2032) in relation to an act of the management corporation, which at \nthat point of time when th e act was performed, was bein g managed by members of the \n22nd management c ouncil. The act was the issuing of a  notice of postponement of 23rd \nannual general meeting after the notice to convene the general meeting was properly \nissued under Paragraph 1 of the First Schedule of the Building Maintenance and Strata \nManagement Act.  \n Mok Chik Pow  / Audrey Chua Chwee Lan   STB No. 108 of 2019 ( Pine Grove  \nv the MCST Plan No. 2032 / Singaram Kogilambal /            Condominium)  \nLee Hoong Cheong       \nPage 3 of 8 \n 2. It will be in order to record that when the application was filed, th e application was for \neight orders including invalidation of the notice of postponement. The othe r orders \nwere in relation to actions of the members of the 22nd management c ouncil that took \nplace after the notice of postponement was issued. After it was determined that there \nwas no scope for settlement by way of mediation, directions were given for an  \narbitration hearing and parties were directed to, inter alia file and exchange Agreed \nIssues and Statement of Facts (Exhibit marked SOF ) and it was agreed that the issue \nfor determination would be  \n \nWhether the Notice of Postponement of the 30 November 20 19 AGM is effective.  \n \n3. In addition to the agreed issue, the respondents informed that they were also seeking \ndeterminations from the Board in relation to the general meeting that was held on 30 \nNovember 2019 (they were of the view that the meeting and the election of members \nof the 23rd management c ouncil were not valid) and whether or not the 2nd and 3rd \nrespondents who were members of the 22nd management c ouncil are appropriate \nparties.  \n \n4. Parties in the SOF set out facts that were agreed , as well as Respondents\u2019 Version of \nFacts  and Applicant s\u2019 Version of Events of 30 November 2019 . \n \nBackground : \n \n5. The relevant facts are not in dispute:  \n \nAs at 17 October 2019, the 22nd management c ouncil of Pine Grove Condominium \n(MCST Pla n No. 2032) comprised eight members including Singaram Kogilambal \n(SK), Lee Hoong Cheong ( LHC ) and Raymond Tan Kim Seng ( TKS). SK and LHC \nwere, respectively the chairperson and secretary of the management c ouncil.  \n \n6. On 25 October 2019, a notice  was given for the convening of the 23rd annual general \nmeeting of MCST Plan No. 2032 (the 25 October 2019 notice) that was to be held on \n30 November 2019 at 2.00 pm at the Pine Grove clubhouse function room. The notice \nwas in accordance  with Paragraphs 1(2 ) and 1(3) of the First Schedule of the Building \nManagement and Strata Titles Act Cap 30 (the First Schedule) and it was signed by \nLHC.  \n \n7. On 29 November 2019 a notice headed ,  \n \n\u201cADJOURNMENT OF THE 23RD ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING \u201d  \n \nwas issued \u201c By Order The Management Corporation Strata Title Plan 2032\u201d.  \n Mok Chik Pow  / Audrey Chua Chwee Lan   STB No. 108 of 2019 ( Pine Grove  \nv the MCST Plan No. 2032 / Singaram Kogilambal /            Condominium)  \nLee Hoong Cheong       \nPage 4 of 8 \n 8. Subsidiary proprietors were, by way of the notice, informed that the meeting that was \nto be held on 30 November 2019 \u201c has been postponed \u201d; a police report \u201c has been filed \nand investigations are pending \u201d; \u201cRelevant authorities will be informed\u201d and \u201c we will \nreschedule a general meeting and keep all subsidiary proprietors informed \u201d (the 29 \nNovember 2019 notice).  \n \n9. At 2.00 pm on 30 November 2019, subsidiary proprietors turned up at the place of the \nmeeting and by 2.30 pm, subsidiary proprietors having an aggregate share value of 716 \nout of the total of 2,640 were at the meeting. They proceeded with the scheduled \nmeet ing. SK (who was in the management office) was invited to chair the meeting. The \ninvitation was done by TKS when he spoke to her via a loudhailer. She did not respond. \nTKS also invited LHC to chair but he declined. One Joseph Ignatius was then elected \nby the subsidiary proprietors to chair the meeting. The meeting proceeded in \naccordance with the agenda set out in the 25 October 2019 notice. Inter alia , eleven  \nmembers were elected as members of the 23rd manageme nt council (before this two \npersons including LHC had attempted to adjourn the meeting without success; no \nmotion for  adjournment was passed; one  person objected to proceeding with the \nmeeting).  \n \n10. In Respondents\u2019 Version of Facts, the respondent informed that on 28 November 2019 \nbetween 8.00 pm to 11.4 5 pm, the 22nd management c ouncil con vened an emergency \nmeeting and \u201c[a]fter a lengthy discussion it was agreed that it would be in the MCST\u2019s \nbest interest for the 23rd AGM to be adjourned, pending a conclusion of the \ninvestigation into the proxy forms and misinformation that had been disse minated over \nthe last few weeks \u201d. The 29 November  2019 notice was issued because members of \nthe 22nd management c ouncil, when they to ok office, discovered several lapses, \nincluding excessive expenditure from the management fund and formed the view that \nan independent auditor should be appointed to conduct a forensic audit on the accounts \nof the management corporation. A group of subsidi ary proprietors started a smear \ncampaign and although the 22nd management c ouncil responded to the misinformation, \na decision was made to issue the 29 November 2019 notice of postponement after they \nuncovered tampering of proxy forms. In the Respondents \u2019 Written Submissions (RWS)  \nthe respondents  said that they  \u201cwere concerned that even if a motion to adjourn was \nraised at the general meeting it cannot be ascertained whether the people who are \ncasting the votes for or against the same are indeed legally en titled to vote \u201d. \n \n11. The Agreed Issue:  \n \nWhether the Notice of Postponement of the 30 November 2019 AGM is effective .  \n \n \n Mok Chik Pow  / Audrey Chua Chwee Lan   STB No. 108 of 2019 ( Pine Grove  \nv the MCST Plan No. 2032 / Singaram Kogilambal /            Condominium)  \nLee Hoong Cheong       \nPage 5 of 8 \n 12. Parties agreed that the Board should make a determination on the agreed issue i.e. the \nBoard was required to determine if the meeting that was convened by way of the 25 \nOctober 2019 notice of meeting was effectively postponed by the 29 November 2019 \nnotice.  \n \nThe Submissions : \n \n13. It was the submission of the applicants that a general meeting had been convened by \nway of the 25 October  2019 notice and the respondents had by way of the 29 November \n2019 notice sought to adjourn the meeting. The 29 November 2019 notice was \nineffective because a meeting convened under Building Maintenance and Strata \nManagement Act Cap 30C ( the Act) can be a djourned only when Paragraph 3A of the \nFirst Schedule has been complied with.  \n \nParagraph 3A of the First Schedule is as follows:  \n \nAdjournment of general meetings  \n3A.\u2014(1) A general meeting of a management corporation or a subsidiary \nmanagement corporation may be adjourned for any reason if a motion to adjourn \nthe meeting is passed at the meeting.  \n(2) The person presiding at a general meeting adjourned under sub -paragraph \n(1) must fix the time and place the general meeting adjourned is to be resu med.  \n(3) The secretary of the management corporation or subsidiary management \ncorporation (as the case may be) must give notice of the time and place fixed \nunder sub -paragraph (2) at least 14 days before the time fixed for the resumed \nmeeting, as follows:  \n(a) by displaying the notice on the notice board of the management corporation \nor subsidiary management corporation;  \n(b) by serving the notice on every subsidiary proprietor.  \n \n14. In this case there was inter alia no motion for adjournment passed; and the tim e and \nplace of the adjourned meeting was not fixed.  \n \n15. Whilst the applicants submitted that the notice was ineffective because there was non -\ncompliance of Paragraph 3A of the First Schedule ( 3A), it was the submission of the \nrespondents that 3A was not applicable in this case as it applied to an adjournment  of \na general meeting and was not applicable to a postponement . \n \n16. In RWS the respondent s referred to Webster\u2019s  New World Dictionary and submitted \nthat there is the difference between an adjournment and a postponement viz for an \nadjournment the meeting must have already commenced and once commenced is then \nsuspended until a future time whilst in the case of a postponement the meeting is put \noff until a later time without commencement. In this case, the 29 November 2019 \nnotice referred to a meeting that was sc heduled to take place on 30 November 2019  Mok Chik Pow  / Audrey Chua Chwee Lan   STB No. 108 of 2019 ( Pine Grove  \nv the MCST Plan No. 2032 / Singaram Kogilambal /            Condominium)  \nLee Hoong Cheong       \nPage 6 of 8 \n and the respondents who were responsible for issuing the notice were seeking a \npostponement rather than an adjournment.  \n \n17. The respondents noted that there are no provisions in the Act in relation to a \npostponement o f a meeting and submitted that \u201cParliament did not intend to regulate \nthe procedure and circumstances under which a management corporation may \npostpone/cancel a general meeting \u201d i.e. it is the submission of the respondents that a \ngeneral meeting that has b een convened by way of a notice under Paragraph 1 of the \nFirst Schedule can be postponed before the meeting has commenced. The respondents \nin this case were carrying out their duties to manage the affairs of the estate and were \nacting in the best interests  of the estate when they issued the 29 November 2019 notice.  \n \nFindings and Decision of the Board : \n \n18. The Board agrees that there is a difference between an adjournment and postponement \nof a general meeting in that for an adjournment the meeting must have alr eady \ncommenced and once commenced is then suspended until a future time whilst in the \ncase of a postponement the meeting is put off until a later time without commencement.  \n \n19. In this case the 29 November 2019 notice was a notice headed \u201c ADJOURNMENT OF \nTHE 2 3RD ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING \u201d that notified subsidiary proprietors that \nthe general meeting to be held on 30 November 2019 \u201c has been postponed \u201d i.e. it was \nheaded \u201c Adjournment\u201d and subsidiary proprietors were notified that the general \nmeeting was being \u201c postponed\u201d. The words adjournment  and postponement  were \nbeing used interchangeably in the notice, but there was no doubt that the respondents \nwho were responsible for issuing the notice were seeking a postponement rather than \nan adjournment.  \n \n20. There is no p rovision in the Act in relation to postponing a general meeting after a valid \nnotice to convene has been given. A management corporation is a statutory creation \nwith duties and powers that are spelt out in the Act. The Board cannot agree that it can \nhave a  power or duty to do an act which is not provided for in the Act  and the Board \nnotes that the Respondent has not tendered to the Board any authorities in support of \nthis contention either . Under section  27 of the Act , a management corporation must \nhold a g eneral meeting in each calendar year  and not more than 15 months after the \nholding of the last preceding annual general meeting and it is clearly set out in section \n27(3) of the Act that meetings and voting at meetings of a management corporation \nmust be c onducted in accordance with the provisions in the First Schedule. One can, \nfrom 3A of the First Schedule note that stringent requirements must be complied with \nbefore a general meeting can be adjourned and under these circumstances it is \nincongruous that a nyone should be able to effect the postponement of a properly \nscheduled meeting by merely issuing a n unsigned  notice announcing that the meeting \nhas been postponed.   \n \n Mok Chik Pow  / Audrey Chua Chwee Lan   STB No. 108 of 2019 ( Pine Grove  \nv the MCST Plan No. 2032 / Singaram Kogilambal /            Condominium)  \nLee Hoong Cheong       \nPage 7 of 8 \n 21. The applicants have in paragraphs 8, 9 and 10 of the Reply Submissions ( ARS) \nsubmitted:   \n \nOnce a general meeting has been duly called, in the absence of express \nprovisions allowing the same, it cannot be postpone d and/or cancelled.  This is \na proposition of long standing law that has been established in the case of Smith \nv Paranga Mines [1906] 2 Ch 193 (\u201cSmith\u201d) (Annex A) , has not been overruled, \nand has in fact been cited and relied on even as recent as 2019 in Kaye & Anor \nv Oxford House (Wimbledon) Management Company Limited [2019] EWHC \n2181 (Ch) (\u201cKaye\u201d) (Annex B).  \n \nIn the case of Bell Resources Ltd v Turnsbridge Pty Ltd & Ors (1988) 13 ACLR \n429 (\u201cBell Resources\u201d) (Annex C) , the Supreme Court of Western Australia also \nnoted at 436 that:  \n \n\u201cThe decision in Smith\u2019s case, supra, has not been overruled. It is universally \ncited in law texts as authority for the proposition stated in its headnote: see \nBuckley on the Companies Act, Butterworths, 13th ed, 1957, p 834; Paterson, \nEdnie and For d, Australian Company Law, Buttersworths, 3rd ed, vol 2, p 59, \n605; Horsley\u2019s Meetings: Procedure, Law and Practice, Butterworths, 2nd ed, \n1983, p 20; A F Topham, Palmer\u2019s Company Precedents, The Law of Meetings, \n4th ed, 1984, 90, 172; Blackwell\u2019s Law of M eetings, 9th ed, 1967, p 87; M Moore, \nThe Law and Procedure of Meetings, 1979, p 75; Shackleton on the Law and \nPractice of Meetings, 6th ed, 1977, p 189; and Joske\u2019s Law and Procedure at \nMeetings in Australia, 75th ed, 1982, p 90.\u201d  \n \nEven though the English  and Australian authorities were in the context of the \nannual general meetings of companies, the same provisions should apply to \nMCSTs in Singapore.  \n \n22. The Board agrees with the above.  \n \n23. It is the decision of the Board that the 29 November 2019 notice is not effective and it \nis ordered that the resolution/decision for the issuing of the 29 November 2019 notice \nbe invalidated.  \n \n24. It is not for the Board at this time to consider whether or not the resolutions passed and \nelections held at the general meeting on 30 November 2019 were valid or otherwise. \nInter alia , the parties who will be affected by any determination on this matter viz the \nthe members elected as members of the 23rd Management Council are not before this \nBoard. It will however not be out of order to note that a general meeting was held on \n30 November 2019, resolutions were passed and elections held. There are provisions \nin the Act for the respondents to apply for necessary orders in relation to the resolutions \npassed and elections held at the meeting.  \n Mok Chik Pow  / Audrey Chua Chwee Lan   STB No. 108 of 2019 ( Pine Grove  \nv the MCST Plan No. 2032 / Singaram Kogilambal /            Condominium)  \nLee Hoong Cheong       \nPage 8 of 8 \n 25.

The Respondent is the Management Corporation Strata Title Plan \nNo. 2748 of the Development (\u201c the Respondent \u201d).\n3.In accordance with the special resolution passed at the 12th Annual General Meeting  held \non 28 May 2016, subsidiary proprietors at the ground floor with private enclosed space \n(\u201cPES\u201d) were allowed to erect awning over the PES (\u201c Awning By-Laws \u201d) subject to the \nfollowing conditions:\n\u201cSPs at the ground floor with PES are only allowed to erect awning over the PES \nsubjection to the following conditions:    \n1. The awning shall be of a design and colour approved as per appendix 1.\n2. The SP shall bear all costs for the erection of the awning including but not\nlimited to appointment of qualified persons to certify and submit the plans to\nrelevant authorities to certify and submit the plans to relevant authorities having\njurisdiction on such matters if required.\n3. The SP shall be responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of the awning\nincluding taking up the necessary insurance for same.\n4. The SP shall extend the fullest cooperation to the contractors appointed by the\nMCST for future repairing and redecoration works or any works to facilitate the\nuse of gondolas for the effective and safe execution of works.\n5. The awning shall not exceed 2m (Width) or beyond the PES\n6. The awning should be inclined at angle to allow rain water flow\u201d\n4.On 10 July 2018, the Applicants\u2019 witness, Mr Toh Cho Boon (\u201cAW-1 \u201d) wrote to the\nRespondent on the installation of a shelter/covering over the entire 4m width of the PES\nof their unit.1 Their main reason for the application was to ensure the safety of the family\nmembers and to protect them from killer litter. The Respondent replied on 26 July 2018\nthat the installation of awning was to be in accordance with the Awning By-Laws, which\nallowed installation of fixed awning not exceeding 2m width.2\n5.The Applicants took their own initiative to obtain a quotation and design proposal from a\ncontractor for a full awning. The Applicants then used the design proposal to seek written\napproval from the Urban Redevelopment Authority (\u201c URA\u201d) on 12 September 2018. The\nApplicants received the URA Grant of Written Permission \u201c( URA grant\u201d) on 9 October\n2018.\n1 Affidavit of evidence in chief (\u201cAEIC\u201d) of Toh Cho Boon dated 26 December 2019 at para 8. \n2 Id, at para 9. Toh Cho Boon / Yong Phui Ling   STB No. 72 of 2019 (The Queens \nv The MCST Plan No. 2748  Condominium) \n4 6.On 10 October 2018, the Applicants sent an email to the Respondents along with the URA\ngrant to request a meeting with the Respondent and to get their approval to install the\nshelter. However, the Applicants\u2019 proposal did not comply with the Awning By-Laws as\nit exceeded 2m. The Respondent advised the Applicants to table their request to install an\nawning beyond what was permitted under the Awning By-Laws at a general meeting. 3\n7.The Applicants submitted a private motion to build an awning beyond 2m but failed to\nobtain the requisite vote to have their motion passed at the Extraordinary General Meeting\non 15 December 2018 (\u201c EGM 2018\u201d ).4 Subsequently, the Applicants attempted to move\nthe same motion at the Annual General Meeting on 25 May 2019 and again failed to obtain\nthe requisite vote to have their motion passed.5\nThe Applicants\u2019 case \n8.The Applicants\u2019 case is that a fixed awning over the whole 4m width of their unit\u2019s PES\nis necessary for their children\u2019s safety as they use the PES frequently (their children are\n14 and 16 years old), and for the safety of the children of their extended family members\nwho visit them frequently.6  The Applicants highlighted a severe problem of high-rise\nlittering at the Development and that a fixed awning over their entire PES should be\nallowed for the protection of their family. 7\n9.The Applicants further submitted that their request for the installation of the fixed awning\nis a fair and reasonable proposal as they had obtained the URA grant.8  In the minutes of\nthe Council Meeting on 30 August 2018, it was recorded that the Respondent had \u201c no\nobjection, in principle, to [AW-1\u2019s] proposal subject to [AW-1] obtaining planning\npermission from the URA\u2026\u201d9\nThe Respondent\u2019s case \n10.The Respondent submitted that there were ten (10) units in the Development with PESs\nand only two (2) units have fixed coverings that comply with the Awnings By-Laws where\nthey do not extend more than 2m.10  The Respondent had also facilitated the Applicants\u2019\nrequest for the fixed coverings beyond the current 2m but the two motions were not passed\nat the general meetings.

Toh Cho Boon / Yong Phui Ling   STB No. 72 of 2019 (The Queens \nv The MCST Plan No. 2748  Condominium) \n5 Applicants\u2019 installation of fixed coverings beyond the 2m permitted under the Awning \nBy-Laws.11 \nBoard\u2019s Findings \n11.Paragraph 5 of the Second Schedule to the Building Maintenance (Strata Management)\nRegulations 2005 (\u201c BMSMR 2005 \u201d) states as follows:\n\u201cAlteration or damage to common property  \n5(1) A subsidiary proprietor or an occupier of a lot shall not mark, paint, drive nails \nor screws or the like into, or otherwise damage or deface, any structure that forms part \nof the common property except with the prior written approval of the management \ncorporation. \n\u2026 \n(3) This by-law shall not prevent a subsidiary proprietor or an occupier of a lot, or a\nperson authorised by such subsidiary proprietor or occupier from installing -\n(a) any locking or other safety device for protection of the subsidiary proprietor\u2019s or\noccupier\u2019s lot against intruders or to improve safety within that lot;\n(b) any screen or other device to prevent entry of animals or insects on the lot;\n(c)any structure or device to prevent harm to children; or\n(d)any device used to affix decorative items to the internal surfaces of the walls in the\nsubsidiary proprietor\u2019s or occupier\u2019s lot.\u201d\n12.Paragraph 5(3)(a) of the Second Schedule to the BMSMR 2005 allows subsidiary \nproprietors to install a safety device to improve safety within that lot  or any structure or \ndevice in order to prevent harm to children  (see Pang Loon Ong and Ors v The MCST \nPlan  No. 4288 STB 21 of 2019 (D\u2019Leedon) at paragraph [10]).  The Board notes the \nphotographs of high-rise littering (including items such as blade and knife) in three (3) \nother ground floor units, besides the Applicants\u2019 unit (i.e. units #XXX, # XXX, #XXX).12 \nThe Board further notes at the hearing that the Respondent\u2019s Chairman, Mr Chong Foo \nNam Nicholas (\u201c RW-1\u201d), had during his cross-examination on the said photographs, said \nthat the litter had fell outside the PES but high rise littering was not a risk that the \nRespondent would take. The Board finds the Respondent had the power to allow any \nsafety devices, including awnings pursuant to Paragraph 5(3)(a) of the Second Schedule \nto the BMSMR 2005 to address the problem of high-rise littering in the Development.\n13.With respect to whether the Respondent is obliged to approve the Applicants\u2019 proposal \nfor a fixed awning covering the entire PES (i.e. the 4m fixed awning) as a necessary, \nreasonable and proportionate response to the high-rise littering problem, the Board finds\n11 Id, at para 18. \n12 Supra n 1, at para 23 and pages 88 to 99. Toh Cho Boon / Yong Phui Ling   STB No. 72 of 2019 (The Queens \nv The MCST Plan No. 2748  Condominium) \n6 that the Respondent is not obliged to approve the Applicants\u2019 proposal for a fixed awning \nover their entire PES.   \n14.Firstly, the Board finds it was not a necessary, reasonable or proportionate response to\nhave a 4m fixed awning when the Respondent was already prepared to allow the\nApplicants to install a retractable awning/covering that the Applicants conceded at the\nhearing, would enable their entire PES to be fully covered. The Respondent had conveyed\nto the Applicants that they did not object to the installation of a retractable covering of\n2m with the initial 2m fixed awning. The installation of the additional 2m retractable\ncovering was subject to the following conditions13 :\n\u201ca. No fixed framework is allowed beyond the initial 2.0m of the fixed covering \nb. Any fixed framework for purposes of structural integrity of the structure is to be\nkept within the initial 2.0m of the fixed covering.\nc. The retractable portion of the retractable covering is to be underneath and in line\nwith the initial 2.0m of the fixed covering, when retracted.\nd. Both the fixed and retractable coverings are (i) to comply with the By-Laws, as\napplicable, (ii) not to result in any increase in the gross floor area of the estate; and\n(iii)to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, codes and guidelines.\u201d\n15.AW-1 testified at the hearing that the Applicants had contacted three (3) contractors who\ninformed him that they were unable to fix the additional 2m retractable covering without\nsupport at the end of the PES.  However, none of the three (3) contractors attended at the\nhearing. The Applicants\u2019 counsel subsequently submitted quotations from the three (3)\ncontractors in their further written submissions dated 23 January 2020 (\u201c Applicants\u2019\nfurther submissions \u201d). The Respondent also submitted an email from an architect that\nthe additional 2m retractable covering could be done.14 As a matter of evidence, the Board\nis unable to conclusively rule in the absence of hearing from the contractors and/or the\narchitect and based on quotations and/or email that the contractors and/or architect were\nnot able or were able to fix an additional 2m retractable covering.\n16.Secondly, it was not necessary, reasonable or proportionate to have the 4m fixed awning\nwhen it was clear the general body refused to vote in favour of the Applicants at two\ngeneral meetings. Notwithstanding support given by the Respondent to the AW-1\u2019s\nmotions, AW-1 still failed to garner enough votes to pass a special resolution for the 4m\nfixed awning.\n13 Supra n 10, at para 19. \n14 Respondent\u2019s submissions dated 23 January 2020 at para 29(r) and Respondent\u2019s Bundle of Authorities \nand Documents at (\u201cRBAD\u201d) at Tab 7. Toh Cho Boon / Yong Phui Ling   STB No. 72 of 2019 (The Queens \nv The MCST Plan No. 2748  Condominium) \n7 17.Lastly, notwithstanding the approval from URA, the Board finds that the installation of a\nfixed awning was subject to the by-laws of the Development.  \u201cPart V \u2013 Additional Notes\u201d\nof the URA grant clearly states that:\n\u201cb) The planning permission from URA granted under the Planning Act does \nnot, in any way, supersede any requirements or by-laws that the MCST may have \nor impose on the development within its powers under the Building Maintenance \n& Strata Management Act (\u201cbold for emphasis\u201d) .  Home owners are still obliged \nto comply with the by-laws which are administered by the development\u2019s MCST and \nshould separately seek the consent of the MCST before erecting the proposed \nstructures.\u201d \n18.Further, the Board also notes that Paragraph 5(3) had to be read together with Paragraph\n5(4) of the Second Schedule to BMSMR 2005, which states:\n\u201cAny such locking or safety device, screen, other device or structure must be \ninstalled in a competent and proper manner and must have an appearance, after it \nhas been installed, in keeping with such guidelines as the management corporation \nmay prescribe regarding such installations, and with the appearance of the rest of \nthe building.\u201d \nThe Board notes at paragraph [10] of the Applicants\u2019 further submissions that the \nApplicants \u201c do not dispute that the Respondent is entitled under Rule 5(4) of the \nPrescribed By-Laws to prescribe guidelines for the installation of shelters over the PES.\u201d  \nThe Board finds that it was not a necessary, reasonable or proportionate response to have \na 4m fixed awning in contravention of by-laws and/or prescribed guidelines.   \n19.The Board noted that use of gondolas was raised at the hearing to buttress the\nRespondent\u2019s position for the additional 2m retractable awning in order that the estate\nmay carry out maintenance works (e.g. painting).  In addition, the Applicants had in their\nfurther submissions provided a letter from an ISOTeam C&P Pte. Ltd. that the gondola\nmovements will be the same whether a 2m awning is fixed or a 4m awning is fixed15;\nwhereas the Respondent had obtained confirmation from a Scatech Engineering Pte Ltd\nof difficulties for gondola installation, dismantling and landing16. Nevertheless, the Board\nfinds that as a matter of evidence, it was not put before the Board whether the installation\nof the awning would prevent the Respondent from painting the external walls or whether\nthe gondolas may still access the external walls without difficulty. As such, the Board has\nnot taken this factor into account in arriving at its decision.\n15 Applicants\u2019 further submission dated 23 January 2020 at para 15. \n16 Supra n 14, at para 43 and RBAD at Tab 8. Toh Cho Boon / Yong Phui Ling   STB No. 72 of 2019 (The Queens \nv The MCST Plan No. 2748  Condominium) \n8 20.The Applicants also raised an issue in their skeletal submissions and further submissions\nthat they should be reimbursed for incurring half the cost of convening the EGM 2018.17\nThe Board makes no order as to whether the Respondent was wrong to offer to share the\ncosts of the EGM 2018 with the Applicants as the application for such an order was not\nprayed for and no evidence was adduced.\nBoard\u2019s Order \n21.The installation of fixed coverings over the entire PES in accordance with the design\nguidelines and specifications as provided by Applicants is not a reasonable response to\nthe killer litter problem. The Board finds that the Respondent has acted necessarily,\nreasonably and proportionately by allowing the installation of a retractable covering of\n2m with the initial 2m fixed awning. The application is thus dismissed.\n22.As the Respondent has submitted that there be no order as to costs, the Board orders that\nthere be no order as to costs.\nDated this 27th day of February 2020 \n__________________________ \nMR ALFONSO ANG \nPresident \n__________________________ \nMR CYRIL SEAH  \nMember \n__________________________ \nMS CHEW YI-LING ELAINE  \nMember \nMr Kishan Pillay & Mr Yap Zhan Ming (M/s \nTSMP Law Corporation) for the Applicants. \nMr Chong Foo Nam Nicholas (in-person) for the \nRespondent. \n17 Applicants\u2019 Skeletal Submissions at para 20 and Supra n 15 at para 29.

The Respondent is the Management Corporation of Esta \nRuby (the \u201c Respondent \u201d). Lau Khee Leong & anor v The MCST Plan No. 3915         STB No. 67 of 2019 (Esta Ruby)  \nPage 3 of 13 2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 The Applicants have been the SPs of #XXX Esta Ruby since April 2013.  1 The \ndevelopment has f our (4) commercial unit s \u2013 the Applicants \u2019 unit being one of them. 2 \nThe air-conditioner  condensers  for the Applicants\u2019  unit is located  on the  roof directly \nabove  the Applicants\u2019  unit. Similar devices  for the other  three  (3) commercial  units  are \nmounted either on a back wall or on the ground.3 It is not in dispute that the roof above \nthe Applicants\u2019 unit is \u201ccommon property\u201d under s. 2(1) of the Building Maintenance and \nStrata Management Act (Cap. 30C, 2008 Rev Ed) (\u201c BMSMA\u201d).     \nWhen the Applicants took possession of the unit from Eastwood Park Ltd, the developer \nof the property,  there  was a ladder  mounted  along  the side of  the Applicants\u2019  unit that \nallowed access to the roof above the unit. This ladder was subsequently removed by the \ndeveloper with the agreement of the Applicants due to potential safety issues before the \nRespondent took over the management of Esta Ruby from the developer in 2014.4    \nSince the removal of the fixed ladder, the Applicants have been using a mobile ladder to \nprovide access for their contractors to access the condenser located on the roof above their \nunit. The Respondent has not prevented the Applicants from using said mobile ladder to \naccess the roof.5    \nIn December  2017, the  Applicants  installed  a signage  on the roof  above  their  unit  for \npromotional purposes.6 The Applicants highlighted that they did not request for approval \nfrom the Respondent to install the signage since they were \u201c under the impression that the \nroof of the premises was for their own exclusive use as represented to them earlier by the \ndevelopers [i.e. Eastwood Park Ltd]\u201d.  7 \nThe Respondent then requested for the Applicants to remove the signage and reinstate the \narea. As a consensus could not be reached at that time, Respondent\u2019s counsel commenced \nlegal  proceedings  against  the Applicants  on 16  July  2018  by way  of Originating \nSummons.8  \nSeparately,  Respondent\u2019s  counsel also sent  the Applicants\u2019  counsel  a letter  dated  3 August \n2018 requesting  for the Applicants  to remove  \u201cfour (4) dolls  on the common  property \nwalkway  in front  of their  unit \u201d.9 In their  response  dated  8 August  2018,  Applicants\u2019 \ncounsel stated that the dolls did not \u201c obstruct common property \u201d, that the Respondent had \n\u201carbitrarily  and discriminatorily  chosen  to enforce  the alleged  by-laws  against  our clients \n[i.e. the Applicants]\u201d and that the  Applicants were willing to remove the dolls provided \nthe Respondent could show that \u201cthey are similarly enforcing the alleged by-laws against \nother subsidiary proprietors for similar violation \u201d. 10  \n1 Affidavit of evidence in chief of Lau Khee  Leong and Ding Hongyan (\u201cLau Khee Leong\u201d), para 8; and affidavit \nof evidence in chief of Ng Sze Hoon (\u201cNg Sze Hoon\u201d), Tab NSH -2, at page 16.  \n2 Ng Sze Hoon, id, at para 6.  \n3 Ibid. \n4 Lau Khee Leong, supra n 1, at para 9.  \n5 Transcript of 12 December 2019, pa ge 33, line 22, to page 34, line 17.  \n6 Lau Khee Leong, supra  n 1, at para 11.  \n7 Id, at para 12.  \n8 Case number DC/OSS 113/2018 - see id, Tab H, at page 57.  \n9 Lau Khee Leong, supra  n 1, Tab I, at page 107.  \n10Id, Tab K, at page 112.

The Respondent  then withdrew their Originating Summons during a hearing on \n10 August 2018  and the Applicants were ordered to pay a total of $2,183.41 in costs and \ndisbursements to the Respondent. 13      \n10 On 17 Septe mber 2018, Applicants\u2019 counsel s ent a letter to the Respond ent - which stated  \ninter alia that: \n(a)The Respondent had classified the roof above the Applicants\u2019 unit as \u201ccommon\nproperty\u201d;\n(b)\u201cAccess to the air -con processor [sic] has been a hassle and highly inconvenient due\nto the 4m height of the said roof \u201d;\n(c)The Applicants faced difficulties in \u201c accessing the air -con compressor for its proper\nmaintenance \u201d, and due to this reason, also \u201c faced difficulties in renting the premises\nout\u201d; and\n(d)The Respondents s hould provide, within ten (10) days of the letter, \u201c plans to enable\nour clients [i.e. the Applicants] convenient access to the said roof, or alternatively\nrelocate the air -con compressor to an accessible and appropriate location\u201d .14\n11 On 21 December 2018, Mr Ng Sze Hoon (\u201c Mr Ng \u201d), a representative from the \nRespondent\u2019s Managing Agent (\u201c MA\u201d), informed the Applicants by email of the \nRespondent\u2019s proposed location for the  relocation of the condensers  to a ledge just below \nthe roof . Mr Ng mentio ned that the Respondent was, as a gesture of goodwill, willing to \nallow a relocation of the condensers and pay for the same if relocated to the Respondent\u2019s \nproposed location.15 However, in a letter dated  24 January 2019, the Respondent  rejected \nthe propose d mounting location \u2013 instead requesting  for the condenser to be located on \nthe ground (similar to other commercial units).16 It is not disputed that the goodwill offer \ntherefore lapsed.17     \n12 Being unable to agree on a course of action  to be taken  by parties, the Applicant s filed an \napplication with the Strata Titles Boards (\u201c STB \u201d) on 26  July 2019.  \nORDERS SOUGHT BY THE APPLICANT S \n13 The Applicant s sought the following orders:  \n\u201c(a) T hat the Respondent relocate the Applicants\u2019 air -con condenser (\u201cthe condenser\u201d) \nto the ground floor at the Respondent\u2019s own costs and/or expenses;  \n(b)That the Respondent reimburse the Applicants for costs paid to Lee & Lee in DC/OSS\n11 Lau Khee Leong, supra  n 1, Tab K, at para 25.  \n12 Id, at para 26.  \n13 Ng Sze Hoon, supra n 1, at para 16.  \n14 Lau Khee Leong, supra n 1, Tab M, at page 183.  \n15 Ng Sze Hoon, supra n 1, at para 20; and id, Tab R, at page 237.  \n16 Lau Khee Leong, supra n 1, Tab S, at page 243.  \n17 Ng Sze Hoon, supra n 1, at para 22.

Lau Khee Leong & anor v The MCST Plan No. 3915         STB No. 67 of 2019 (Esta Ruby)  \nPage 7 of 13 21 Mr Ng also highlighted that Mr Lau, being a member of the Management Council since \nthe first Annual General Meeting (\u201c AGM \u201d), \u201cnever brought up the issue of the location \nof the air -con compressors at any council meeting until a letter from his lawyers dated 17 \nSeptember 2018 \u201d. 27 \n22 During the hearing, Mr Ng suggested that the Applicants could access the condensers in \nthe common property by using a cat ladder or scaffolding and metal staging (a non -\npermanent fixture).28 \n23 In response to a question from the Board regarding the area  from which  a person could \naccess the roof above the Applicants\u2019  unit (with the aid of a mobile ladder), Mr Ng \nconfirmed  that getting to that particular area requires the person to  first pass through a lift \nlobby  requiring  card access.  In the case of visiting contractors, security guards would \nprovide card access on behalf o f the MCST. 29    \nISSUES BEFORE THE BOARD  \n24 There are two broad issues before the Boar d: firstly over the provision of access or  \nrelocation of the air -conditioner condensers and secondly over  the reimbursement, if any, \nof monies paid by the Applicants in relation to DC/OSS 113/2018. The Board will first \nconsider whether the Respondent has a  duty under s. 29(1)(a)  and s. 29(2)(b)  BMSMA to \nprovide access and/or to relocate the air -conditioner condensers . In particular, the issue \nof whether the present mode of access to the roof (in the absence of a fixed ladder or \npermanent fixture with the same purpose) is unsafe will be examined.  \n25 If the Respondent has duties  under s. 29(1)(a)  and s. 29(2)(b)  to provid e access and/or to \nrelocate the condensers , the Board will then determine whether the Respondent has the \nresponsibility to relocate the condenser to the ground floor at their own costs.       \n26 The Board will also consider whether there are grounds for the  Applicants\u2019 prayers \nregarding monies paid  in relation to DC/OSS 113/2018 (see paragraph 13 above).    \nBOARD\u2019S FINDINGS  \nWhether  the Respondent has a duty and power  under s.  29(1)(a)  and 29(2)(b)  BMSMA  to \nprovide access to the condensers     \n27 To understand  the scope of the Respondent\u2019s duty to \u201c control, manage and administer \u201d \nthe common property under s . 29(1)(a ) BMSMA in relation to this case,  the Board makes \nreference to  s. 29(1)(d). The relevant sections  state:  \n\u201c Duties  and powers of management corporation in respect of property  \n29.\u2014(1) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (3), it shall be the duty of a \nmanagement corporation \u2014 \n(a) to control, manage and administer  the common property for the benefit of all\n27 Ng Sze Hoon, supra n 1, at para 9.  \n28 Transcript of 12 December 2019, page 102, line s 10 to 24.  \n29 Id, page 137, line 5 to page 139, lines 5 to 24.

T he Appellant  in that case, who \nwas an SP,  was denied the use  of an existing lift, which  did not stop on the floors of his \naccessory lots. 31 The lift buttons to said floors were deactivated due to, inter alia, safety \nconcerns.  The Court  of Appeal  held that:  \n(a)The Appellant was entitled to \u201c reasonable use and enjoyment \u201d of his personal\nproperty and that such enjoyment  included  \u201cthe available means of access to his\nproperty \u201d; and\n(b)\u201cAs there is an existing lift  providing means to access to all units in the building, he\n[i.e. the Appellant]  is entitled to reasonable use and enjoyment of such lift in common\nwith the other subsidiary proprietors, unless such use and enjoyment is not possible .\u201d\n32\n30 Applicants\u2019 Closing Submissions, at para 13.  \n31 Abraham Aaron Issac v The Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 664 [1999] SGCA 32. \n32 Id, at para 21 . Lau Khee Leong & anor v The MCST Plan No. 3915         STB No. 67 of 2019 (Esta Ruby)  \nPage 9 of 13 32 The issues  in Abraham A aron Issac  are different from the case at hand.  It is clear that  the \n\u201creasonable use and enjoyment \u201d of the lift (as common property) referred to  by the Court \nwas contingent upon various factors, including  the fact that : \n(a)Personal property high lighted by the Court was in reference to the Appellant\u2019 units,\nnot private property located on common property; and\n(b)The right to  access was recognized  considering, inter alia , that:\ni.The lift was an existing mode of access;\nii.Said mode of access was availabl e to all other SPs; and\niii.This entitlement would apply \u201cunless such use and enjoyment is not\npossible\u201d .\n33 In Sit Kwong Lam v MCST Plan No. 2645 (\u201cSit Kwong Lam \u201d), the Court considered the \nissue of whether the installation of an air -conditioning ventilation unit on common \nproperty constituted the \u201c exclusive use and enjoyment of \u2026 the whole or any part of the \ncommon property \u201d covered under s. 33 BMSMA. 33 The Court held that this was the case \nbecause:  \n\u201c\u2026 as a result of the installation of Work 3 [i.e. the air -conditioning ventilation unit] , the \narea in question could no longer be used by any other subsidiary proprietor as it was \npermanently physically occupied by the air -conditioning ventilation unit. \u201d34 [Emphasis \nadded]  \n34 Additionally, the Board refers to Wu Chiu Lin v MCST Plan No. 2874  (\u201cWu Chiu Lin \u201d) \n\u2013which considered whether roof coverings, installed above the roof trellis and attached\nto external walls (deemed common property by the Court), constituted \u201c exclusive use and\nenjoyment \u201d of said common propert y.35 The Court also held that it was the case since such\nroof coverings would \u201c constitute a use of parts of the external walls by the Applicants\nwho install the coverings to the exclusion of the other subsidiary proprietors \u201d.36\n[Emphasis added]\n35 Accordingly,  the Board is of the view that the relocation of the Applicants\u2019 condensers to \nthe ground floor would constitute \u201c the exclusive use and enjoyment of \u201d the \u201c whole or part \nof the common property \u201d covered under s. 33 BMSMA.  \n36 It is not in dispute that the air -conditioner condensers are the private property of the \nApplicants, which is located on common property.37 It is also not in dispute that the \nApplicants have been  accessing their condenser via a mobile ladder since the mounted \nladder was removed.38 \n37 In fact, when questioned by Respondent\u2019s counse l on the necessity of moving the \ncondensers, Mr Lau replied that \u201cit\u2019s not necessary, frankly speaking \u201d to relocate the \ncondensers. However,  Mr Lau  highlighted that the Respondent should carry out the \n33 Sit Kwong Lam v Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 2645 [2017] SGHC; decision upheld in  [2018] \nSGCA 14.  \n34 Id, at para 105.  \n35 Wu Chiu Lin v Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 2874 [2018] SGHC 43  \n36 Id, at para 78.  \n37 Supra n 24. \n38 Supra n 5.

While working from heights does  bear a certain degree of risk, it does not \nnaturally follow that the existing mode of access is unsafe.  No evidence was presented to \nthe Board on safety requirements other than bare statements made by the Applicants.  \n41 On the other hand, the Board notes that, inter alia : \n(a)Landscaping contractors engaged by the Respondent have been accessing the flat roof\nabove the Applicants\u2019 unit \u201c without \u2026 any safety concerns \u201d;41\n(b)The access point where a mobile ladder can be set up to access the roof is secured by\ncard access \u2013 acting as deterrence to any potential trespassers;42 and\n(c)Air-conditioning contractors have professed the view to the Respondent that  accessing\nthe Applicants\u2019 condensers at the height of four (4) metres is safe and  arguably safer\nthan accessing the condensers of other SP living on high floors \u2013 which would require\nan individual to \u201c climb over their \u2026 low wall onto the external fa\u00e7ade p rotected by a\nsmall little railing to maintain the condensing units \u201d.43\n42 The Board is of the view that any potential safety issues should be considered with \nreference to the provisions of the BMSMA. In this context, s. 37A BMSMA  would have \nto be consider ed. The relevant portion states:  \n\u201cInstallation of safety equipment permitted  \n37A.\u2014 (1) A subsidiary proprietor of a lot in a building on a parcel comprised in a strata \ntitle plan may install safety equipment on the lot, or as part of any window, door or \nopening on the lot which is facing outdoors, despite any other provision of thi s Act or \n39 Transcript of 12 December 2019, page 42, line 10 , to page 43, line 5.  \n40 Supra n 30, at para 3(d). \n41 Transcript of  12 December 2019, page 131, lines 12 to 23. \n42 Id, page 137, line 5 to page 138, line 10.  \n43 Id, page 132, lines 2 to 12.

It is clear that this provision does not impose a duty for the MCST to \ninstall safety equipment on common property.     \n44 The Board  further  notes that during the period of time when the Applicants were under \nthe impression that the roof above their unit was for their exclusive use (i.e. between 2013 \nand 2017), the Applicants did not propose any measures to improve safety conditions with \nregard to accessing the roof.44 In fact, the firs t instance where the Applicants raised the \nissue of safety was when they found out that the roof above their unit was actually \ncommon property that was not for their exclusive use.  \n45 As such, the Board is of the view that  the Applicants have not discharged the burden  of \nproof that the current mode of acces s to their condensers ( locate d on common property) \nis unsafe , or that  that there is a necessity for the Applicants\u2019 condensers to be relocated  to \nthe ground floor  for safety reasons.  \nWhether there are gro unds for the Applicants to claim reimbursements for payments made \nin relation to DC/OSS 113/2018  \n46 The requirements relating to the  doctrine of res judicata was outlined  in Lee Tat \nDevelopment Pte Ltd v MCST Plan No 301 (\u201cLee Tat Development \u201d).45 The Court  of \nAppeal , in Lee Tat Development , held that:  \n\u201cThe requirements of an issue estoppel were: (a) there needed to be a final and \nconclusive judgment on the merits ; (b) that judgment had to be by a court of competent \njurisdiction; (c) there had to be identity between the parties to the two actions that were \nbeing compared; and (d) there had to be an identity of subject matter in the two \nproceedings. In relation to the last requirement, the decision on the issue must have been \na \u201cnecessary step\u201d to the decision, or a \u201cmatter which was necessary to decide and which \nwas decided as the ground work of the decision \u201d.46 [Emphasis added]  \n47 The Board notes that the Court Order  in DC/OSS 113/2018  ordered that the MSCT be \ngiven  leave to withdraw the application and that the Defendants were to pay the Plaintiffs \ncosts fixed at $1,500 plus reasonable disbursements to be agreed or taxed .47 Aside from \nthe costs o rder, the Board is unable to agree that res judicata applied in this case.  The \nBoard was not made aware of the terms leading to the Court\u2019s Order, if any.  \n48 The Applicants are relying on s. 101(1)(c)  BMSMA  for their claims and in seeking \ndamages for these sums paid.48 \n49 As the Respondent has pointed out, s. 101(3) BMSMA provi des expressly that the Board \n44 Transcript of 12 December 2019,  page 37, line 4, to page 39, line 16.  \n45 Lee Tat Development Pte Ltd v Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 301 [2005] SGCA 22,  \n46 Id, at para 1.  \n47 Supra n 13.  \n48 Refer to the Applicants\u2019  Closing Submissions, Part V II.

At the time, \nthe Respondents  were  aware that approval  from  the Applicant  was  required  for \nrenovation works but did not apply for approval for the installation of glass curtains.2    \n1 Transcript of 17 December 2019, page 62, line 23, to page 63, line 3. \n2 Id, page 61, lines 11 to 17.   The MCST Plan No. 4188 v Lim Yeong Seng & anor         STB No. 53 of 2019 (A Treasure Trove)  \nPage 3 of 13 3 In a circular  addressed to all SPs  (dated 4 Oct ober 2016 ), the Applicant  noted that some \nSPs had \u201c installed sliding glass windows at their balcony area which is deemed as \nunauthorized works \u201d and  highlighted to all SPs of A Treasure Trove , inter alia , that: \n(a)SPs have the  responsibility to ensure renovation works carried out do  not \u201c affect the\nexternal look and uniformity of the fa\u00e7ade \u201d;\n(b)Highlighted  that according to the Resident\u2019s Handbook, SPs were \u201c not authorized to\ncommence any work before approval is granted \u201d;\n(c)\u201cEnclosing the balcony with  sliding windows or terrace is likely to increase the cross\nfloor area (GFA) of the building \u201d and SPs were \u201c not allowed to effect any\nimprovement which increase or likely to increase the GFA of the building \u201d; and\n(d)SPs who had carri ed out such works should \u201c rectify them by 31 Oct 2016 \u201d, failing\nwhich the matter(s) would be escalated to the Urban Redevelopment Agency\n(\u201cURA \u201d) or other relevant authorities.3\n4 Mr Lim Yeong Seng (\u201c Mr Lim \u201d), one of the Respondents, replied with  a letter  (dated 5 \nOctober 2016 ) to the Applicant . In summary, the letter stated : \n(a)The Respondent s\u2019 belief that the installation of the glass curt ains did not violate any\nof URA\u2019s guidelines since the  installation did not  fully enclose the balcony of the unit\n(since  there was a ten (10) centimeter gap between  the top of the glass panel and the\nceiling of the balcony ) or cause the external fa\u00e7ad e of the building to be altered; and\n(b)That the  Respondents would not remove the glass curtains unless \u201c stronger reasons\non wh y it is necessary to do so \u201d were provided.4\n5 In October 2016 , Mr Sam Cheng (\u201c Mr Cheng \u201d), a representative  of the Applicant\u2019s \nManaging Agent  (\u201cMA\u201d) at the time,  informed URA that a resident had \u201c enclosed their \nfront balcony with sliding glass window [s]\u201d. Mr Cheng  sought clarification from URA \non whether the glass curtains installed in the Respondents\u2019 balcony was permissible and \nwhether any action would be taken on URA\u2019s  part. Notably,  URA responded  that: \n(a)\u201cGlass windows are not allowed as balcony screens s ince they do not comply with\nthe performance criteria that URA has set out for balcony screens \u201d;\n(b)The Management Corporation Strata Title (\u201c MCST \u201d) was in \u201c the best position \u201d to\nget residents to remove said glass curtains , since the MCST was  \u201cempowered by t he\nBMSMA to enforce the by -laws that have been drawn up in relation to such works \u201d.\n5\n6 Between August 2018 and May 2019 , Ms Rachel Teo (\u201c Ms Teo \u201d), a representative of \nthe Applicant\u2019 s present Managing Agent, sought confirmation  from URA (via  a series of \nletters and  electronic mail)  on the permissibility of the glass curtains in the Respondents\u2019 \n3 Affidavit of evidence in chief of Lim Yeong Seng, Tab 2, at page 16.  \n4 Id, Tab 3, at page 18.  \n5 Id, Tab 4, at page 20.  The MCST Plan No. 4188 v Lim Yeong Seng & anor         STB No. 53 of 2019 (A Treasure Trove)  \nPage 4 of 13 unit considering various other factors.  In summary, URA stated that:  \n(a)The balcony of the Respondents\u2019 unit is \u201c designed and approved as a semi -outdoo r\nspace \u201d \u2013 so any screening erected would have to comply with the following\nperformance criteria:\ni.\u201c \u2026 be porous enough to allow for natural ventilation within the balcony\nat all times even when the screens are fully drawn closed \u201d; and\nii.\u201c \u2026 are capable of being drawn open or retracted fully \u201d;6\n(b)Each panel of the screen should have \u201c wide gaps, openings, slats or louvres for air to\nflow freely ;7\n(c)\u201cGlass curtains (with or without any gap on the top), do not comply with the\nabovementioned criteria, and thus can not be permitted \u201d;8 and\n(d)The balcony for the Respondents\u2019 unit was computed as Gross Floor Area (\u201c GFA \u201d)\nunder the Balcony Incentive Scheme and that balconies approved under this scheme\n\u201care to remain as semi -outdoor areas \u201d \u2013 therefore \u201c glass curtains are n ot allowed as\nthese would effectively convert the balconies into indoor spaces \u201d.9\n7 The Respondents received several letters from Ms Teo  (acting on behalf of the Applicant)  \nbetween December 2018 and January 2019 requesting for the glass curtains to be \nremoved  as the glass curtains did not comply with URA\u2019s performance criteria10 and were \nnot included in the approved designs specified by the MCST11. In res ponse to the demand, \nMr Lim reiterated his belief that he was \u201c in conformance with the regulation as s tated by \n[the MCST]\u201d and that there was \u201c no necessity [\u2026] to take any further action \u201d.12  \n8 As parties were unable to resolve t he matter, the Applicant filed an application with  the \nStrata Titles Boards on 27 June  2019 .  \nORDERS SOUGHT BY THE APPLICANT  \n9 The Applicant  sought  a mandatory injunction  requiring  \u201cthe Respondents  [to] remove \nUnauthorized Glass Curtains installed at the balcony of the  Unit and reinstate the \narea\u201d.13  \nISSUES BEFORE THE BOARD  \n10 The Board will first consi der the applicability of s. 37A of the Building Maintenance and \nStrata Management Act (Cap. 30C, 2008 Rev Ed) (\u201c BMSMA \u201d) (i.e. glass curtains as \n\u201csafety equipment \u201d) to the case at hand \u2013 in particular whether the duties of the SP with \nregard to installation of safety equipment under s. 37 A have been fulfilled.    \n6 Lim Yeong Seng, supra n 3, Tab 7, at page 31. \n7 Ibid. \n8 Ibid. \n9 Id, Tab 7, at page 30.  \n10 Id, Tab 9, at page 69.  \n11 Id, Tab 9, at page 65.  \n12 Id, Tab 9, at page 68.  \n13 Applicant\u2019s Written Submissions, at para 3.

The \nfocal points  would be on whether the glass curtains are:  \n(a)An improvement which \u201c increases or is likely to increase the floor area of the land\nand building comprised in the strata title plan \u201d covered under sections 37(1) and\n37(2); and/or\n(b)An improvement which \u201c affects  the appearance of any building comprised in the\nstrata title plan\u201d  under sections 37(3) and 37(4).\n12 Where the Board find that the glass curtains have breache d the relevant provisions of \nsections 37A or 37 (as the case may be), the Board will consider whether there are \ngrounds for a mandatory injunction to be granted .  \nAPPLICANT \u2019S CASE  \n13 The Applicant\u2019s key points for the removal of the glass curtains are that  said glass \ncurtains : \n(a)Affect the appearance of the building  and are  in breach of s. 37(3) BMSMA;\n(b)\u201c \u2026 increase or are likely to increase the floor area of the building and [are]  therefore\nin breach of Section 37(1) BMSMA \u201d; and\n(c)\u201cDo not follow the design guideline for safety devices at balconies in the estate \u201d and\ntherefore \u201c do not qualify as a safety device under Section 37A BMSMA \u201d.14\n14 Mr Ling Bin Onn (\u201c Mr Ling \u201d), a director of Bond Properties Pte Ltd (\u201c Bond \nProperties \u201d) which is the present Managing Agent of the Applicant, was called to give \nevidence.  \n15 In his affidavit of evidence in chief, Mr Ling highlighted that apart from the \nRespondents\u2019,  other SPs only installed either of the following  in their balconies : \n(a)Approved balcony screens (\u201coperable l ouvred  screen \u201d reflected  in the Resident\u2019 s\nHandbook15);\n(b)Approved \u201c blinds in a standard color \u201d; or\n(c)Invisible grilles (permitted due to safety considerations).16\n16 Upon  being questioned by  Respondents\u2019 counsel , Mr Ling  conceded that the  \u201coperable \nlourved screen \u201d was the  only \u201c alternative design \u201d which was  \u201cknown to the residents \nthrough the handbook \u201d and that  applications for  the installation of blinds and  invisible \n14 Applicant\u2019s Closing Submissions, at para 52.   \n15 Affidavit of evidence in chief of Ling Bin Onn, Tab 4, at page 216.  \n16 Ibid, at para 22.

In Mr Lim\u2019s \naffidavit of evidence in chief, he stated his belief that \u201c the Applicant\u2019s Application with \nthe Strata Titles Board has no legal basis, and that even if the re is a breach of URA\u2019s \nregulations, the Applicant has no locus standi and no jurisdiction against me under the \nStrata Titles Board to ask for an order to remove my balcony installation \u201d.24    \n21 Mr Lim also stated  in his affidavit that getting the Respondents\u2019 to remove the glass \ncurtains \u201c will not change the appearance of the building as there is already no uniformity \nin the exterior of the balconies in the condominium \u201d25 and that sa id glass curtains  were \ninstalled  for \u201c safety, some shelter from the rain , and to provide privacy and sun -\nshading \u201d26. \n17 Transcript of 17 December 2019, page 51 , lines 1 to 12.  \n18 Ibid, page 44, line 9, to page 45, line 25.   \n19 Ibid, page 49, lines 10 to 17.  \n20 Ibid, page 47, line 1 to page 48, line   \n21 Respondents\u2019 Closing Submissions, at para 13.  \n22 Id, at para 20.  \n23 Id, at para 21.  \n24 Lim Yeong Seng, supra n 3, at para 22.  \n25 Id, at para 31.  \n26 Id, at para 32.

Mr Lim \nstated his belief that the \u201c only thing that  [the MCST] \u2026 allow [sic] was the aluminium \n[\u201coperable lourved screens\u201d]\u201d and that \u201c any other panel, any other covering, right, th ey \nwould have rejected it \u201d. 27    \nBOARD\u2019S FINDINGS  \nApplicabili ty of s ection 37A BMSMA  \u2013 glass windows as \u201csafety equipment\u201d  \n23 The relevant portion of s.  37A BMSMA states:  \n\u201cInstallation of safety equipment permitted  \n37A.\u2014 (1) A subsidiary proprietor of a  lot in a building on a parcel comprised I a strata \ntitle plan may install safety equipment on the lot,  or as part of any window, door or \nopening on the lot which is facing outdoors, despite any other provision of  this Act or \nthe regulations or any by -law of the parcel which otherwis e prohibits the installation of \nsuch safety equipment.  \n(2) A subsidiary proprietor of a lot in  a building who installs safety equipment under this\nsection must \u2014\n(a) repair any damage c aused to any part of the common property or limited\ncommo n property (as the case may be) by the installation of the safety\nequipment; and\n(b) ensure that the safety equipm ent is installed in a competent and proper\nmanner and has a n appearance, after it has been installed, in keeping with  the\nappearance of the building. [\u2026]\u201d\n24 During  the Second Reading of the BMSMA Bill dated 11 September 2017, which  counsel \nfrom both sides cited in their Closing Submissions , the Second Minister for National \nDevelopment, Mr Desmond Lee, stated that:  \n\u201cBut a new section 37A(2) will place the onus on SPs to ensure that their installations \nmaintain a certain uniformity of appearance. In this regard, developers and MCSTs are \nencouraged to provide design guidelines for such installations upfront, to guide SP s in \nachieving the overall desired appearance .\u201d 28 [emphasis added]  \n25 The Board finds that the SP\u2019s onus to ensure that any safety equipment installed is in \n\u201ckeeping with the appearance of the building \u201d covered in s. 37A(2)(b) does imply that \nSPs should comp ly with design guidelines defined by the MCST regarding such safety \ninstallations  where available .   \n26 The Respondents  did not apply to the MCST for approval for the installation of the glass \n27 Transcript of 17 December 2019, page 88, lines 5 to 20.  \n28 Respondent\u2019s Bundle of Authorities for Respondent\u2019s Submissions No. 1, at page 64.

Nonetheless , \nthey decided to carry on with  installing the glass curtains  anyway  instead of opting for \nother approved designs  outlined by the Applicant  - which could serve the same purpose \nwith regard to  safety  (i.e. preventing individuals from  falling off the balcony) .29  \n27 While safety is of grave concern to the Board, this argument on the Respondents\u2019 part \nappears to be more of an afterthought to justify their  actions  \u2013 considering how the issue \nof safety was not brought up until this matter escalated to a hearing.30 The following  \nobservations  reinforce this notion : \n(a)Although Respondent\u2019s counsel reiterated the \u201c ever present danger of children\nactually falling down from buildings \u201d and attempted to frame the safety issue as\nsuch31, Mr Lim did eventually reveal that he has two adult children aged 25 and 2732;\n(b)Emphasis placed by the Respondents on other aspects (irrelevant to safety) to justify\nthe purpose for the installation of glass curtains \u2013 including that the \u201c tea-table \u2026\nneeds to be pro tected from the rain \u201d and that if the approved aluminum screens were\ninstalled, \u201c the whole place is dark, air cannot come in and the quality of living, if I\nwere to install that, will be very low \u201d;33 and\n(c)The Respondents\u2019 reason for not bringing up safety as a key reason for the installation\nof the glass curtain s earlier  was that  there was \u201c no necessity to raise [the issue of\nsafety]\u201d because \u201c it was never asked \u201d by the MCST . 34\n28 Accordingly,  the Board finds that  the Respondents have made out their case under  37A. \nWhether the glass curtains increased  the floor area of the Respondents\u2019 unit under sections \n37(1) and 37(2) BMSMA   \n29 The Board will next consider sections 37(1) and 37(2) of the BMSMA, which states:  \n\u201c 37.\u2014(1) Except pursuant to an authority granted under subsection (2), no subsidiary \nproprietor of a lot that is comprised in a strata title plan shall effect any improvement in \nor upon his lot for his benefit which increases or is l ikely to increase the floor area of the \nland and building comprised in the strata title plan.  \n(2) A  management corporation may, at the request of a subsidiary proprietor of any lot\ncomprised in its strata title plan and upon such terms as it considers appropriate, by 90%\nresolution, authorise the subsidiary proprietor to effect any improvement in or upo n his\nlot referred to in subsection (1). \u201d\n29 Supra n 27.  \n30 Transcript of 17 December 2019, page 63, line 7, to page 64, line 9. \n31 Id, page 18, lines 1 to 18.    \n32 Id, page 62, lines 5  to 22. \n33 Id, page 73, lines 1 to 11.  \n34 Id, page 63, lines 7 to 23.  The MCST Plan No. 4188 v Lim Yeong Seng & anor         STB No. 53 of 2019 (A Treasure Trove)  \nPage 9 of 13 30 In the  case of MCST  Plan No 3667 v Chong Tack Chuan & anor (the \u201c Chong Tack \nChuan case \u201d), the Court considered  whether  the D efendants had enclosed their unit  by \ninstalling SMART windows ( comprising  multiple  floor -to-ceiling glass panels with a ten \n(10) millimeter gap  between panels  when drawn closed) in their balcony  \u2013 thus increasing\nthe Residential GFA of the unit .35 The Court considered evidence from parties  and held\nthat the balcony installation did not comply with URA\u2019s performance criteria since it was\n\u201cnot porous enough to allow for natural ventilation within the balcony at all times even\nwhen the windows are fully drawn closed \u201d.36\n31 Notably, the Court (in the Chong Tack Chuan case) stated that:  \n\u201cSimply put , the defendants had installed the SMART windows in the passageway balcony \nand kitchen balcony because they did not want wind and rain to enter these areas \u2026 \nEvidently, the defendants\u2019 intention in not wanting wind and rain to enter the \npassageway balcony and kitchen balcony runs antithesis to the intended nature of such \nbalconies as semi -outdoor spaces  having a reasonable degree of openness at all times, \nmeaning that these balconies are intended to be subject to some measure  of wind and \nrain at  all times. \u201d37 [Emphases added]     \n32 One of the four reasons covered  by the Respondents on the purpose of the glass curtains \nwas shel ter from the rain. In his letter to Ms Teo dated 11 December 2018, Mr Ling \nhighlighted that the \u201c screens are for the sole purpose of keep ing the rain out and \nprotecting my son\u2019s tea table from being damaged by the rain \u201d.38 It appears that  the glass  \ncurtains  effectively allowed the Respondents to use their balcony in a manner that was \ncontrary to its intended nature  as a \u201c semi-outdoor space \u201d. \n33 Counsel on both sides have highlighted the relevance of  Low Yung Chyuan v The MCST \nPlan No. 2178 (the \u201c Castle Green case \u201d) to the case at hand.39 The Castle Green  case is \ndifferent due to multiple reasons, including  the fact that :  \n(a)The MCST had no basis to reject the Applicant\u2019s proposal since other units had\nsimilar designs approved;40 and\n(b)The Applicant followed the procedures prescribed in the BMSMA \u2013 first making an\napplication under s. 37(4) BMSMA and escalating the matter to STB under s. 111(b)\nafter the proposal was rejected.41\n34 The Board fin ds sufficient evidence that by installing glass curtains, the Respondents \nhave effectively enclosed  their balcony and \u201c increased the floor area of the land and \nbuilding comprised in the strata title plan \u201d under s. 37(1) BMSMA. It was highlighted \nin para graph  6(d) that the GFA of the balcony in the Respondents\u2019 unit was granted under \nthe Balcony Incentive Scheme and was not considered under Base GFA.     \n35 Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 3667 v Chong Tack Chuan & Anor [2016] SGDC 30 . \n36 Id, at para 31.  \n37 The Chong Tack Chuan  case, supra n 31, at para 26.  \n38 Lim Yeong Seng, supra n 3, Tab 9, at page 31.  \n39 Low Yung Chyuan v The Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 2178 [2019] STB 20 of 2019.  \n40 Id, at para 25.  \n41 Id, at para 24.  The MCST Plan No. 4188 v Lim Yeong Seng & anor         STB No. 53 of 2019 (A Treasure Trove)  \nPage 10 of 13 35 The Board further notes that no 90 percent resoluti on under s. 37(2) was sought and/or \nobtained by the Respondents with regard to the installation of the glass curtains.   \nWhether the glass curtains \u201caffects the appearance of any building comprised in the strata \ntitle plan\u201d under sections 37(3) and 37(4)  BMSMA   \n36 The Board will also examine sections 37(3) and 37(4) of the BMSMA, which states:  \n\u201c (3) Except pursuant to an authority granted under subsection (4) by the management \ncorporation or permitted under section 37A, no subsidiary proprietor of a lot that is \ncomprised in a strata title plan shall effect any other improvement in or upon his lot \nfor his benefit which affects the appearance of any building comprised in the strata \ntitle plan.  \n(4) A management corporation may, at the request of a subsidiar y proprietor of any\nlot comprised in its strata title plan and upon such terms as it considers appropriate,\nauthorise the subsidiary proprietor to effect any improvement in or upon his lot\nreferred to in subsection (3) if the management corporation is sati sfied that the\nimprovement in or upon the lot \u2014\n(a) will not detract from the appearance of any of the buildings comprised in\nthe strata title plan or will be in keeping with the rest of the buildings; and\n(b) will not affect the structural integrity of any of the buildings comprised in\nthe strata title plan. \u201d\n37 From the evidence adduced by parties, the Boa rd makes the following finding of fact : \n(a)The front of the Respondent\u2019s  balcony obviously reflect s more sunlight than other\nunits due to  the material of the glass curtains \u2013 which does not occur with  the\napproved designs (e.g. aluminum operable lourved screens); 42 and\n(b)The lintel above the glass curtains, which runs across the perimeter of the\nRespondents\u2019 balcony, stands out  significantly  from the other units.43\n38 Accordingly, the Board finds that the installation of glass curtains was an improvement \nthat affected the appearance of the building fa\u00e7ade covered under  s. 37(3) BMSMA but  \nnotes that no authorization under s. 37(4) was sought  by the Respondents from the \nApplicant to install  said glass curtains.   \nWhether there are grounds for a mandatory injunction  \n39 The test for  granting of a mandatory injunction in breach of a negative covenant , adopted \nby Chao Hick Tin J (as he then was),  was laid down in MCST Plan No. 1378 v Chen Ee \n42 Lim Yeong Seng, supra n 3, Tab 10, at page  99. \n43 Ibid; and id, Tab 10 , at page 100.

This  case involved  the removal of unauthorized sliding windows and doors \nunder the estate\u2019s by -laws and s. 37(3) BMSMA .47  \n41 The Board finds that the Applicant has not performed any act(s) that would make the \ngranting of a mandatory injunction unjust. In fact, t he Applicant  displayed commendable \nrestraint, providing:  \n(a)Adequate notice with regard to the issue concerning the  unaut horized glass curtains ;\n(b)Advice on how the situation could be rectified and passed on the information obtained\nfrom URA on the permissibility of glass curtains on the balcony; and\n(c)Ample time  for the Respondents  to rectify the situation.\n42 With regard to whether the \u201c breach is trivial or has caused no damage or no appreciable \ndamage to the plaintiff\u201d  the Board finds the \u201cdamage\u201d  incurred in this case is similar  to \nwhat was covered  the Gallop Gables case. A relevant extract from Gallop Gables  states:  \n\u201cThe respondents were, from the outset, aware of the concerns of the applicants and \nchose to complete their renovations when the necessary approvals had yet to be granted. \nThey have placed the body corporate and the council in a most difficult  position. If it went \nwithout challenge and goes without redress, their authority is  undermined and their \nhands tied in deciding future action with respect to the  preservation and appearance of \nthe building and the performance of their duty to  act in the common interest  of all \nproprietors. \u201d48 [Emphasis added]  \n43 While a mandatory injunction would impose \u201c substantial hardship \u201d upon the \nRespondents (in the form of costs relating to the removal of the glass curtains and \nreinstatement works), it would also  help to  alleviate the damage highlighted in paragraph  \n44 Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 1378 v Chen Ee Yueh Rachel [1993] SGHC 283  \n45 Applicant\u2019s Closing Submissions, paras 47 to 49; and Respondents\u2019 Closing Submissions, para 42. \n46 The Rachel Chen  case, supra n 37, at para 22.  \n47 Management Corporat e Strata Title Plan No  2440 v Ee Min Kiat & anor [2017 ] STB 21 of 2016  \n48 Id, at para 67.

They then refused to remove it when the Applicant told them to do so after \nconsulting URA. This in effect passes the buck to the Applicant to take action and force s \nthem to do so by way of applying for an injunction. The Respondent s then allege  that the \nApplicant will not meet the threshold requirements for a mandatory injunction because, \ninter alia, the breach is trivial and would cause substantial hardship to the Respondent s \nto remo ve it.  \n45 This appears to by a calculated attempt by the Respondents to \u201cgame the system\u201d in \ngetting their glass windows approved by default because the pre -approved designs were \nnot aesthetically pleasing to them and/or in their opinion, unsuitable for their intended \nuse of the balcony (i.e. to drink tea). The Board hopes that SPs will refrain from such \nconduct as it undermines the basis for communal living in self-governing  strata -titled \nproperties as laid out in the BMSMA and by -laws of the development . \n46 SPs unhappy with existing designs have other means to  achieve their desired outcomes \n(e.g. by proposing alternative  balcony screen  designs  that meet the regulatory \nrequirements  to be approved at an Annual General Meeting ). While the process would \ntake s ome time, such process should be followed  for the  overall  benefit of all SPs living \nin a particular strata -titled development.  \nBOARD\u2019S DECISION  \n47 The Board finds that the Respondent  is in breach of sections 37(1) and 37(3) of the \nBMSMA and is satisfied that there are grounds for a mandatory injunction to be granted \nin relation to the removal of the glass curtains in the Respondents\u2019 balcony  and for \nreinstatement works to be done.   \n48 The Board  orders as follows : \n1.That the application is allowed and a mandatory injunction is granted in favo ur of the\nApplicant;\n2.The Respondents are to remove the unauthorized glass curtains installed at the\nbalcony of the Respondents\u2019 unit and to reinstate  the area to its pre -existing condition\nwithin eight  (8) weeks from  the date of this Order  (i.e. by 11 March 2020) ; and\n3.The Respondents are to pay t he Ap plicants as follows:\na.$ 15,855.75 being costs and disbursements (excluding transcription fees);\nb.$1,100 being the STB application and hearing fees; and\nc.The full cost of transcription fees.The MCST Plan No. 4188 v Lim Yeong Seng & anor         STB No. 53 of 2019 (A Treasure Trove)  \nPage 13 of 13 Dated this 15th day of January 2020  \n   _________________________  \n   Mr. Raymond Lye  \n   Deputy President  \n   _________________________  \n Mr. Ashvinkumar s/o Kantilal  \n   Member  \n   _________________________  \n   Mr. Cyril Seah  \n   Member  \nMr. Toh Kok Seng and Mr. Daniel Chen  (M/s Lee & Lee ) for \nthe Applicant . \nMr. David Ling, Mr. S.

The Respondent is \nthe Management Corporation of Mandalay Mansion (the \u201cRespondent \u201d). \nIt is not in dispute  that the rooftop  (located  directly  above  the Applicant\u2019s  unit)  is \n\u201ccommon  property\u201d   as defined in Section 2(1) of the Building Maintenance and Strata \nManagement A ct (Cap. 30C, 2008 Rev Ed) (\u201cBMSMA \u201d). \nOn 21 August 2018, a part of the false ceiling in the Applicant\u2019s second living room (part \nof which  was repurposed  as a dance  studio)  collapsed,  together  with spalled  concrete . Edna Kong Suet Peng v The MCST Plan No. 221                STB No. 41 of 2019 (Mandalay Mansion)  \n3 The Applicant\u2019s husband, Mr Chua Hock Seng (\u201c Mr Chua \u201d), was present at the time. \nHe gave evidence that the coll apse injured three (3) persons and that the police, \nambulance and the Building and Construction Authority (\u201c BCA \u201d) were contacted for \nassistance .1    \n4 On 13 September 2018, the BCA issued a Notice to Maintain to  the Applicant and \nRespondent ( the \u201cParties \u201d). The Applicant appointed Er Lee  Hon Leong (\u201c Er Lee \u201d) and \nthe Respondent engaged Er Goh Khai Siang (\u201c Er Goh \u201d) to perform inspections and each  \nprovide a report  of their findings and recommendations  to the BCA pursuant to the \nNotice.  Investigations continued  in relation  to the collapse of the false ceiling.   \n5 On or around 13 January 2019,  the parties attended a meeting with Mr Ivan Goh (\u201c Mr \nGoh\u201d) of IGM Construction (S) Pte Ltd  (\u201cIGM \u201d), who had been engaged by the \nRespondent to perform thermographic scans on  the building. 2 During the meeting, Mr \nGoh highlighted that  with respect to the roof,  the scans suggested  \u201cnegligent foundation \nmaintenance of the roof leading to serious porosity an d water -proofing/ingress issues \u201d.3 \nIGM subsequently produced  a service report  (the \u201cIGM Report \u201d) indicating their \nfindings as well as a  quotation ( both dated 21 January 2019 ) to the Respondent .4  \n6 As parties we re unable to resolve the dispute  regarding  the collapse of the  false ceiling , \nthe Applicant filed an application with  the Strata Titles Boards  (\u201cSTB \u201d) on 22 May 2019 . \n7 On 11 September 2019, the Board gave directions f or parties to engage their own \nProfessional E ngineers to perform a joint investigation  on the incident . The parties re-\nengage d Er Lee and Er Goh respectively and they perform ed the joint investigation  on 20 \nSeptember 2019 .  Both engineers reported that: \n(a) The false ceiling collapsed  due to the weight of spalled concrete resting on it; 5\n(b) Signs of previous water stains were observed but  there were  no signs of dripping\nwater; 6 and\n(c) Seepage  of moisture  into the concrete  slab led to the corrosion of the reinforcement\nbars, eventually resulting in spalling concrete .7\nORDERS SOUGHT BY THE APPLICANT  \n8 The Applicant sought the  following orders:  \n\u201c(1) That the Respondent be ordered to engage a BCA registered and licensed water \nassessment company to conduct a waterproofing assessment on the MCST Roof and on \nthe applicant\u2019s unit ceiling and rectify all defects highlighted in this waterproofing \n1 Affidavit of evidence in chief of Chua Hock Seng dated 30 October 2019, at para 2.  \n2 Transcript of 22 November 2019 , page 238, at lines 18 to 24.  \n3 Chua Hock Seng, supra  n 1, at para 13.  \n4 Second supplemental  affidavit of evidence in chief of Chua Hock Seng dated 20 October 2019, Exhibit D.  \n5 Joint Expert\u2019s List of Agreed and Disagreed Points, at point i(a).  \n6 Id, at point i(c).  \n7 Affidavit of evidence in chief of Lee Hon Leong dated 30 Oc tober 2019, Exhibit E, section 5, at para 3; affidavit \nof evidence in chief of Goh Khai Siang dated 30 October 2019, Tab 2, section 5, at para 1.

Mr Yeoh conducted an inspection of Mandalay Mansion on 15 October 2019  \u2013 \nwhich involved a visual inspection of the site aided by a \u201c standard quality tool kit \u201d. 9 \n12 Mr Yeoh released his initial inspection report on 17 October 2019 and an additional \ndefects report on 28 October 2019. In summary, Mr Yeoh highlighted  that: \n(a)The r oot cause of the collapse was the \u201c failure of the waterproofing system  [of the\nrooftop], which resulted in water ingress to the concrete and rebar \u201d;10\n(b)The torch on membrane was performed in a spot repair manner \u2013 resulting in an\nuneven surface and leading to water ponding on the rooftop ;11 and\n(c)\u201cActive and past efflorescence stains \u201d were obse rved under the soffit ceiling slab of\nthe Applicant\u2019s unit, coinciding with some water ponding areas on the rooftop.12\n13 The Applicant called on Er Lee to provide evidence  as an expert witness . As a part of  Er \nLee\u2019s report  to the BCA  (dated 12 September 2018 ), a visual inspection, tapping (to chec k \nfor hollowness ) and load tests to the  false ceiling  supports were performed . Notably, Er \nLee found  that: \n8 Applicant\u2019s Opening Statement, at para 12.  \n9 Affidavit of evidence in chief of Yeoh Cheng Yow Jake dated 30  October 2019, Exhibit B, Executive Summary, \nat para 3.  \n10 Id, Exhibit C, at section 5(a).  \n11 Id, Exhibit C, at section 3(c) to 3(d).  \n12 Id, Exhibit B, Executive Summary, at para 5.  Edna Kong Suet Peng v The MCST Plan No. 221                STB No. 41 of 2019 (Mandalay Mansion)  \n5 (a)There was  evidence of  water ponding on the roof top above the collapsed ar ea of  the\nApplicant\u2019s unit  13 (among other areas) ;\n(b)If ponding occurr ed directly on the roof slab  at any point of time in the past  (i.e.\npenetrating the waterproofing membrane) , this could have le d to water ingress and\ncause d spalling concrete over time14; and\n(c)Supports for the false ceiling were safe and adequate in consideration of load tests\nperformed15.\n14 Among other things , Er Lee concluded  in his joint inspection report (dated 25 September \n2019)  that the most probable cause of the spalling  concrete  was ingress of moisture due \nto ineffective waterproofing of the roof   - in consideration of \u201c extensive spalling concrete \nand corroded steel reinforcement bars on the roof slab soffit\u201d .16  \n15 Mr Chua was called by the Applicant to provide evidence. In his  affidavit of evidence in \nchief, Mr Chua  mentioned that t he Respondent  had denied his request s for them to \nprovide records evidencing waterproofing works on the rooftop as well as the IGM \nReport. 17 The said report was eventually presented to the Board  as an  exhibit to  Mr \nChua\u2019s supplemental affidavit dated 20 November 2019.  \nRESPONDENT\u2019S CASE  \n16 The Respondent \u2019s position is that the Applicant  was responsible for the spalling concrete \nthat led to the collapse of the false ceiling  since the Applicant:\n(a)Failed to adequately address the issue of spalling concrete (stemming from the false\nceiling installed by the previous owner ) when the Applicant conducted works on the\nunit in 2012 ; and\n(b)\u201cHad not properly installed \u201d the  current false ceiling  \u2013 which worsened  the issue of\nspalling concrete  and led  to the  collapse of said false ceiling.18\n17 Mr Peter Wong Ying Wai  (\u201cMr Wong \u201d), the  former  chairman  of the Management \nCouncil, gave evidence  that Mr Chua had written to the Respondent on 14 December \n2012  to enquire on whether the Respondent would take on the costs of rectifying spalling \nconcrete issues as well as cracks  observed  in certain parts of the Applicant\u2019s unit.19 It is \nnot in dispute  that the Applicant was conducting works to the unit at  or around that point \nof time.  \n18 Having visited the Applicant\u2019 s unit  around  December 2012  to check on the a ffected  areas  \n13 Lee Hon Leong , supra  n 7, Exhibit C, at section 2.3.9.  \n14 Id, Exhibit C, at section 4.9.  \n15 Id, Exhibit C, at section 2.4.6.  \n16 Id, Exhibit D, section 5.0, at para 3.  \n17 Chua Hock Seng, supra  n 1, at para 21.  \n18 Respondent\u2019s Opening Statement, at para 4.  \n19 Affidavit of evidence in chief of Peter Wong Ying Wai dated 30 October 2019, para 10. Edna Kong Suet Peng v The MCST Plan No. 221                STB No. 41 of 2019 (Mandalay Mansion)  \n6 (during his tenure as chairman ), Mr Wong\u2019s opinion was that the damage to the ceiling \nwas caused by \u201c the previous subsidiary proprietors\u2019 internal fittings and/or failure to \nmaintain their ceiling properly \u201d since the affected areas  from the collapse  of the false \nceiling  corresponded with the areas where the previous owner (s) of the unit had installed \nfalse ceilings .20   \n19 Mr Wong  also filed an interlocutory app lication  on 11  November 2019 to adduce  \nsupple mental /additional  evidence, which included documents from a 2014 legal dispute  \nbetween the Applicant\u2019s husband and their contractor in the Subordinate Courts (as it was \nthen known).21 Mr Wong stated that the  documents were key in showing that the \nApplicant \u201c did not carry out the necessary or proper repairs to the spalling before \ninstalling its false ceiling \u201d. 22   \n20 Mr De Souza Terence John (\u201c Mr De Souza \u201d), an employee of the Managing Agent of \nMandalay Mansion,  was called by the Respondent to give evidence. Mr De Souza  stated \nthat the Respondent appointed Annai Constructions Pte Ltd (\u201c Annai \u201d) to perform further \nwaterproofing works on the roof of Mandalay Mansion on or around 14 September 2018 .\n23 A spray test  of the rooftop  (with water drain off)  was performed subsequently.24  \n21 Er Chan Yew Liang  (\u201cEr Chan \u201d), a Professional Engineer, was called by the Respondent \nto provide evidence as an expert witness.  Although Er Chan  did not perform a physical \ninspection of the Applicant\u2019s unit , he relied on  photographs taken of the affected areas in \nthe Applicant\u2019s unit  for his  report . 25  \n22 In his report dated 30 October 2019, Er Chan conclu ded that the causes leading to the \ncollapse of the false ceiling  arose f rom the quality of the concrete.  He mentioned that t he \nmetal hangers holding up the false ceiling were fixed onto areas of the concrete slab that \nwere  previously repaired with cement plaster26 as well as areas that  had unrectifie d \nspalling concrete issues27.  \n23 Er Goh was  then called by the Respondent to provide evidence  as an expert witness . He \nhad performed a visual in spection of  24 units within  Mandalay Mansion  (including the \nApplicant\u2019s unit) and produced his first report on 28 November 2018.  He also provided \na second report dated 28 September 2019  after performing a joint investigation with Er \nLee. In summary , Er Goh  highlighted  that: \n(a)The possible causes of spalling concrete were :\ni.\u201cInadequate compaction/vibration applied that those areas in question\nduring construction stage under the common situation of congestion of\nreinforcement \u201d; 28\n20 Peter Wong Ying Wai , supra  n 19,  at para 14.  \n21 Arte Associates (Private) Ltd. v Chua Hock Seng [DC Suit No 287 of 2014]  \n22 Supplemental affidavit of evidence in chief of Peter Wong Ying Wai dated 11 November 2019, at para 5.  \n23 Affidavit of evidence in chief of De Souza Terence John dated 30 October 2019, at para 8.  \n24 Transcript of  27 November 2019,  page 4, at lines 2 to 7.  \n25 Transcript of 27 November 2019, page 105, at lines 1 to 10.  \n26Affidavit of evidence in chief of Chan Yew Liang dated 30 October 2019, Exhibit CYL -1, at para 21.  \n27 Id, Exhibit CYL -1, at para 22.  \n28 Goh Khai Siang, supra  n 7, Tab 1, at section 4, para 5, at point a.

The Board notes, however, that the Respondent  \ndid not  order further tests to check  on the serviceability of the waterproofing membrane  \non the rooftop - having been  informed  by Mr Goh of IGM that the  membrane was \ndamaged  after the collapse . 38 In any event, Mr De Souza conceded that the Respondent \ndid have a waterproofing specialist who provided a warranty for the waterproofing on the \nroof, but that when leakage occurred, they refused to honour  the warranty because the \nRespondent damaged the waterpr oofing during the removal of the water tank. As a result, \nthe Respondent then engaged Annai.39      \n32 While Er Goh  provided alternative explanations on why the concrete spalling o ccurred  \n(e.g. inadequate concrete cover) , the Board notes  that further tests were  not performed to \nsupplement Er Goh\u2019s  visual inspection and  to narrow down the probable cause (s) of \nspalling concrete in the Applicant\u2019s unit.  Further, t he Board\u2019s view is that the \nwaterproofing membrane on the rooftop of Mandalay Mansion was not teste d in a \nsatisfactory manner. Instead of the spray test performed by Annai (during which water \nwas allowed to run off 40), a water ponding test should have been  performed.

When questioned by \nApplicant\u2019s counsel on why  ingress of water from the rooftop was not  investigated further \nas a possible cause, Er Chan replied that there was no need to do so as the concrete \nspalling was due to the \u201c nature of the material \u201d and that water ingress was \u201c a minor \nfactor [causing concrete spalling]\u201d without elaborating further. 43 \n35 It is pertinent to note that after the collapse of the false ceiling, the Respondent engaged \nAnnai in September 2018 to waterproof the whole rooftop as a precaution because the  \nRespondent of was the view that the  collapse might have been due to water ingress \ncausing the concrete to spall.44 It was unfortunate that they did not see fit to test the roof \nslab for moisture that may have already been present.  \nRespondent\u2019s failure to discharge burden of pr oof relating t o poor workmanship  of \nrenovation works carried out in 2012 as the root cause of the collapse   \n36 The Respondent adduced evidence of a prior lawsuit in 2014 involving the Applicant and \ntheir decorator  in an attempt to show that the renovation work to the Appl icant\u2019s unit  in \n2012  was not done properly, including works done to the false ceiling.  \n37 In 2012, the Respondent engaged Er Wang Khang Neng (\u201c Er Wang \u201d) of EPM \nConsultants (\u201c EPM \u201d) to perform an inspection of the Applicant\u2019s unit  (among other \nunits) to investigate the issue  of spalling concrete .45 Er Wang subsequently released a \nreport dated 31 October 2012. The Board notes that the area  on the floor  plan marked out  \nby Er Wang46, which had spalling concrete , does not over lap with the area where the \n2018 co llapse occurred47.  \n41 Transcript of 27 November 2019 , page 178, lines 1 to 11.  \n42 Id, page 179, line 8 to page 180, line 7.  \n43 Id, page 107, line 15 to page 108, line 20.  \n44 Id, page 30, line 22 to page 31, line 12.   \n45 Supra  n 18, at para 11 to para 12.   \n46 Goh Khai Siang , supra n 7, tab 1, at page 97 . \n47 Goh Khai Siang, supra n 7, tab 1, at page 65.  Edna Kong Suet Peng v The MCST Plan No. 221                STB No. 41 of 2019 (Mandalay Mansion)  \n10 38 As to the evidence relating to the 2014 lawsuit, what was exhibited was substantially \nincomplete or selective, and the Board is unable to discern with any degree of clarity that \nit is relevant to the collapsed false ceiling in question when compared to Er Wang\u2019s clear \ndiagram of where the spalling concrete occurred in 2012.  \n39 Additionally, simulated l oads tests performed  in August 2018  by Er Lee on the false \nceiling supports  using a force equivalent to 10 kilograms ( a force estimated by E r Lee  as \nthe dead load of the false ceiling)  suggested that said supports were adequate for its \npurpose .48 Er Goh , on the other hand, commented during the hearing that the weight was \n\u201ctoo light \u201d but  subsequently agreed that he did not perform  any further  tests of his own \naccord . 49 \n40 The Board  further  notes that the  Respondent  did rely on  Er Lee\u2019s estimate of the weight \nof spalled concrete which accumulated on the false ceiling of the collapsed area (i.e. 374 \nkilograms)  in the Respondent\u2019s Closing Submissio ns.50 This suggests that the \nRespondent was aware  and accepted  that the false ceiling supports above the collapsed \narea actually withstood a much greater force than what was utilized in Er Lee\u2019s load test \n(i.e. 10 kilograms)  before eventually giving way.   \n41 As to the assertions  that the cause of the false ceiling collapse may have been due to \ninsufficient concrete cover, Er Goh confirmed to a question by the Board that no tests \nwere done on the sufficiency of the cover.51   \n42 The Board is of the view that the  Respondent has not discharged the burden of showing \nthat the collapse of the false ceiling was a  result of the false ceiling works  in 2012 carried \nout by the Applicant . This is so even if the Applicant bears the responsibility for the \nperiodic inspection a nd maintenance of their property.  \nRespondent\u2019s duty to maintain the roof \n43 The Board  is also of the view that the Respondent  has the duty to maintain and  repair the \nroof slab under  Section 29(1)(b)(i) of the BMSMA. T he relevant portions  of S.29 of the \nBMSMA states :  \n\u201c1) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (3), it shall be  the duty of a \nmanagement corporation \u2014 \n(a) to control, manage and administer  the common property  for the benefit of\nall the subsidiary proprietors constituting  the management corporation;\n(b) to properly maintain and keep in a state of good and  serviceable repair\n(including, where reasonably necessary,  renew or replace the whole or part\nthereof) \u2014\ni.the common property; [\u2026]\u201d\n48 Lee Hon Leong, supra n 7, exhibit C, at point 2.4.6.  \n49 Transcript of 27 November 2019, page 153, line 21 to page 155, line 22.  \n50 Respondent\u2019s Closing Submissions, at para 133.  \n51 Transcript of 27 November 2019, page 172, line 1 to line 18.  Edna Kong Suet Peng v The MCST Plan No. 221                STB No. 41 of 2019 (Mandalay Mansion)  \n11 44 The Board notes that the Respondent has not provided a complete set of repair and/or \nmaintenance works carried out on the rooftop in the past five(5) years, save for the \nselective documents relating to waterproofing works done by Annai in 2018. When the \nquestion was posed to Mr De Souza as t o whether he f elt it was necessary to produce  \nthem, he replied no because \u201c everything is there, everything what I \u2013 whatever I said is \nin the AEIC \u201d. 52 \nBOARD\u2019S DECISION  \n45 The Board finds that the Respondent  has not rebutted the statutory presumption under \nSection 101(8) of the BMSMA and  therefore  remains liable.  Accordingly, this application \nis allowed.    \n46 The Board  orders as follows : \n1.That the Applicant and Respondent be ordered to jointly engage a Qualified Person\n(\u201cQP\u201d) at the Respondent\u2019s costs  to:\na.Assess the water tightness of the building  roof, as well as the presence of\nmoisture in the roof slab, if any ,  and prescribe the rectifications to the\nwaterproofing works  and/or roof slab , if any;\nb.Prescribe the repairs works to the spalling concrete affecting  the Applicant\u2019s\nunit where required ;\nc.Prescribe the period of rectification and/or repair works for item s (a) and (b)\nabove, if any; and\nd.Such assessment report to be completed within one (1) month from the date\nof this Order (i.e.  by 17th January  2020 ).\n2.That the Respondent be ordered to  engage a BCA -registered contractor(s) to  carry out\nthe repair works to the Applicant\u2019s unit , at the Respondent\u2019s costs,  as prescribed by\nthe QP and to make good the false ceiling and any other part of the Applicant\u2019s unit\nso affected by the above -mentioned works to be certified by said QP  upon\ncompletion ;\n3.That the Respondent be ordered to pay the Applicant  damages,  costs  and\ndisbursement s of this Application , excluding STB fees,  in the amount of $85,000 all\nin; and\n4.That the Respondent be  further  ordered to reimburse the Applicant the cost of\ntranscription service s, the STB application fee  of $500  and to bear the total STB fees\nfor the four (4) arbitration hearings held on 13th November 2019, 22nd November\n2019, 27th November 2019 and 18th December 2019  of $1,200 .\n52 Transcript of 27 November 2019, page 18, line 21 to page 19, line 24.

Koh Chong Chiah/Low Kim Hiang ( \u201cKCC/LKH \u201d) are the applicants in STB 54 of 2019 .\nKoh G hee Heng/Ng Tiang Hong ( \u201cKGH/NTH \u201d) are the applicants in STB 55 of 2019 .\n2. The applicants are subsidiary proprietors in the development known as Oxley Bizhub at\n61 Ubi Road 1.  They applied for the following orders against the management corporation\nof the development ( \u201cthe respondent \u201d):\na To invalidate the 4th AGM of MCST 4111 an d call for EOGM ; and\nb To convene a general meeting of MCST 4111 .\n3. At a pre -mediation conference, the applicants indicated that what they wanted were\ninvalidation of all resolutions and elections at the 4th annual general meeting ( \u201cthe AGM \u201d)\nof the respondent  held on the 1 December 2018. Whilst every effort was made to resolve\nthe dispute between the parties at two mediation sessions, the Board was not successful\nin resolving the dispute and the applicants informed that they wanted the dispute to be\nresolved by way of an arbitration hearing.\n4. The applicants, during  the mediation , clarified and confirmed that the orders that they\nwere seeking were invalidation of the election of the council members at the AGM when\nnine (9) persons were elected as memb ers of the council , and that the grounds for\ninvalidation were that fraudulent and incomplete letters of authority and proxy forms were\nused in the elections.\n5. It was noted that whilst the applicants were seeking orders for invalidation of the elections\nof the nine  (9) persons, including one Derrick Chan , as council members ; it was apparent\nfrom the contents of Form 8 where the applicants are required to narrate the nature of the\ndispute that it was in fact the manner and conduct of some council members, especially\nDerrick Chan , in carrying out their duties as council members that was the source of the\napplicants\u2019 displeasure.\n6. It was also noted that the next annual general meeting, when new council members would\nbe elected was due to be held shortly and in these circumstances the Board had expressed\nits concern with regard to the resources of the Board being expended in an arbitration\nhearing under the provisions of the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act\nCap 30C ( \u201cthe Act \u201d).\nApplicants\u2019 case  \n7. In their affidavit of evidence  in chief  marked \u201cAW1 \u201d, KCC/LKH referred to requests for\ninspections of letters of authority and proxy forms made by KCC and other subsidiary\nproprietors on 1 Dec ember  2018 and since 31 May 2019 .  It was, inter alia , alleged  that\nthe conditions for inspection were unreasonable. It was the evidence of KCC/LKH thatKoh Chong Chiah/ Low Kim Hiang and Koh Ghee Heng/                 STB Nos. 54 & 55 of 2019 (Oxley \nNg Tiang Hong v the MCST No. 4111  Bizhub)  \n4 after sighting the documents,  60 letters of authority/proxy forms were either fraudulent or \nincomplete. They were, according to the applicants, fraudulent/incomplete  because there \nwas no company stamp, no letter head/company address, no signature, and not an original \nin that it was a faxed or photocopied document.  \n8. At Tab 3 of AW1, KCC/LKH tabulated particulars of the 92 letters of authority/proxy  \nforms that they contended were incomplete/fraudulent. At Tab 4 of AW1, KCC/LKH \nattached documents that appeared to be declarations from one Lim Kai Ling dated 3 \nSeptember 2019.  The declarant identified himself as a director of Lim Soo Seng and Sons \nPte Ltd (the subsidiary proprietor of seven (7) lots in the development) and declared that  \nhe had not authorised or appointed anyone as his proxy to participate and vote at the AGM. \nHe also declared that he had not given his consent to be nominated as a candidate for \nelection as a member of the council.  He was one of the candidates who was successfully  \nelected as a member of the council at the AGM.\n9. It did not appear from Tab 3 that a proxy form had been submitted by Lim Kai Ling.  From \nthe particulars in Tab 3, the subsidiary proprietor of the seven (7) lots owned by Lim Soo \nSeng and Sons Pte Ltd had submitted a letter of authority that did not bear the company\u2019s \nstamp. There was however at Tab 4 a document that purported to be a letter of authority  \ndated 20 November 2018 from Lim Soo Seng and Sons Pte Ltd that did not bear a \ncompany seal and had portions redacted/erased.\n10. KCC/LKH also submitted what they alleged were whatsapp exchanges in relation to the \ncompleting of a letter of authority and a letter of authority authorising Derrick Chan to \nrepresent the subsidiary proprietor of one lot (Quan Ting Trading and General Contractor  \nPte Ltd, #XXX) as its representative at the AGM.  It appeared that KCC/LKH were \nalleging that the letter of authority was fraudulent because the signature on the letter of \nauthority did not appear to be the same as on the whatsapp. In Tab 3 of AW1, it appeared  \nthat the subsidiary proprietor of #XXX had submitted a letter of authority that did not \nhave an address and company stamp.\n11. In AW1, KCC/LKH also attached what they referred to as an \u201cOpening Statement\u201d and a \nresponse to the written submission filed by the respondent when the application was filed  \nwherein it appeared that they were seeking orders other than the invalidation of the \nelection of the council members at the AGM including orders for invalidation of \nresolutions that were not passed and orders that the Board did not have power to make,\ne.g. the barring of a candidate from standing for election as a council member when he \nwas not ineligible under the Act.\n12. KGH/NTH did not submit any affidavits of evidence/documents in accordance with the \ndirections given for the arbitration hearing.  On its own accord, the Board extended the \ntime fixed for submission and on the last day of the extended time, KGH/NTH filed their  \naffidavit (marked \u201cAW2\u201d). In AW2 they, as in the case of KCC/LKH, affirmed that \nfraudulent and/or incomplete letters of authority and proxy forms were used in the \nelections.  Inter alia, KGH also referred to his election as council member and alleged thatKoh Chong Chiah/ Low Kim Hiang and Koh Ghee Heng/                 STB Nos. 54 & 55 of 2019 (Oxley \nNg Tiang Hong v the MCST No. 4111  Bizhub)  \n5 he was asked to step down because, according to him, he had revealed Derrick Chan\u2019s \nwrongdoing; and he also made a number of allegations of wrongdoing on the part of \nDerrick C han. \nRespondent\u2019s case  \n13. On the part of the respondent, it was submitted that there were no valid reasons for the\ninvalidation of the elections. With regard to Ricky Lim (Lim Kai Ling) who was\nsuccessfully elected as a member of the council, the respondent submitted that a written\nconsent under section 53B(4) of the Act was not a requirement yet at the time of the 4th\nAGM.  (It was with effect from 1 Feb ruary  2019, the commencement date of the Building\nMaintenance and Strata Management (Amendment )  Act 2017 , that a nomination for\nelection to be a member of the council of a management corporation would be of no effect\nunless the nomination was inter alia accompanied by the consent of the candidate).\n14. With regard to \u201cincomplete/fraudulent\u201d documents it was sub mitted that there is no legal\nrequirement for a letter of authority to be printed on a company letterhead; no legal\nrequirement for the letter of authority to state the company\u2019s G oods and Services Tax\n(\u201cGST\u201d) number; that it could be signed by an authoris ed officer or contain a company\nseal; and that there is no requirement for it to be both signed and stamped.\nBoard\u2019s Decision  \n15. The Board is, under section 103 of the Act, empowered to invalidate resolutions of or\nelections held at a meeting of the manageme nt corporation.\nOrder to invalidate proceedings  \n103.\u2014(1) Where, pursuant to an application by a subsidiary proprietor or first \nmortgagee of a lot, a Board considers that the provisions of this Act have not been \ncomplied with in relation to a meeting of t he management corporation or subsidiary \nmanagement corporation, the Board may, by order \u2014 \n(a) invalidate any resolution of, or election held by, the persons present at the\nmeeting; or\n(b) refuse to invalidate any such resolution or election.\n(2) A Board shall not make an order under subsection (1) refusing to invalidate a\nresolution or election unless it considers \u2014\n(a) that the failure to comply with the provisions of this Act did not prejudicially affect\nany person; and\n(b) that compliance with the prov isions of this Act would not have resulted in a failure\nto pass the resolution, or have affected the result of the election, as the case may be.\n16. It can be noted that a Board has a discretion as to whether or not an order for invalidation\nshould be made when the provisions of the Act in relation to a meeting of the management\ncorporation has not been complied with.  It is only when a person has been prejudiced by\nthe non compliance and the non compliance affected the result of the election or theKoh Chong Chiah/ Low Kim Hiang and Koh Ghee Heng/                 STB Nos. 54 & 55 of 2019 (Oxley \nNg Tiang Hong v the MCST No. 4111  Bizhub)  \n6 resolution would have failed if there was compliance  that an order for invalidation must \nbe made. Accordingly , if the failure to comply had not prejudicially affected anyone or \ncompliance would not have resulted in failure to pass the resolution or affect ed the result \nof an election , the Board can refuse to invalidate when provisions of the Act in relation to \na meeting of the management corporation have not been complied with. When no one has \nbeen prejudicially affected and compliance would not have affect ed the result of the \nelection there would be no good reason for the Board to invalidate the election.  \n17. Considering the evidence adduced it could, at the ver y highest, be submitted that 92\n\u201cinvalid\u201d votes were cast in the election the nine council members. The number of votes\ncast in favour of the nine (9)  members were who were elected as council members were\nbetween 173 and 184.  The unsuccessful members received between 8 and 25 votes.\nAccordingly, if the \u201cinvalid\u201d votes were not to be counted, the elector al success of the\nnine elected woud not have been adversely affected.  Discounting of the \u201cinvalid\u201d votes\nwould also not have resulted in success on the part of the unsuccessful  candidates.\n18. In this case there were, other than documents purportedly made by  Lim Kai Ling/M /s Lim\nSoo Seng and Sons Pte Ltd/Quan Ting Trading and General Contractor Pte Ltd, only\nallegations of incomplete/fraudulent letters of authority and proxy forms. The\n\u201cincomplete/fraudulent\u201d documents which were alleged to have been used in the elections\nwere not adduced in evidence and even though the applicants had, when directions were\ngiven (on 14 October 2019) informed that Lim Kai Ling and Jenny Kwok would be called\nas witnesses for the applicants, there was no evidence from Lim Kai Lin g or anyone from\nM/s Lim Soo Seng and Sons Pte Ltd or Quan Ting Trading and General Contractor Pte\nLtd to clarify the documents that were supposed to have been made by them. It is not the\nfinding of the Board that \u201cincomplete/fraudulent\u201d letters of authori ty and proxy forms\nwere used in the elections. Even if there were in fact invalid votes and they had been\ncounted in the election of the nine  (9) council members there was no evidence that it\nprejudicially affected another and compliance would have affecte d the results of the\nelection.\n19. The applications are dismissed.\n20. It will be in order to note that in this case  subsidiary proprietors from 207 lots attended\nthe AGM and 165 had given letters of authority or a proxy to Derrick Chan to represent\nthem at the meeting. There was no doubt that the outcome of voting on any resolution or\nelection at the meeting was depend ent on how votes were cast by Derrick Chan.\nDeterminations of elections and resolutions via accumulation of proxies cannot now be\nachieved because with the recent amendments to the Act, a person can only be appointed\nas a proxy holder for either 2% of the  total number of lots in the development or two (2)\nsubsidiary proprietors, whichever is higher.Koh Chong Chiah/ Low Kim Hiang and Koh Ghee Heng/                 STB Nos. 54 & 55 of 2019 (Oxley \nNg Tiang Hong v the MCST No. 4111  Bizhub)  \n7 21. We have considered the submissions with regard to costs and the Board is of the view that\nit will be approriate that in addition to fees payable in connec tion with the applications\nthe applicants p ay costs fixed at  $4000.\nDated this 16th day of  December 2019  \n______________________ _______ ____  \nMR REMEDIOS F .G \nDeputy President  \n______ ________________________ ___ \nMR LAWRENCE ANG BOON KONG  \nMember  \n_____ ________________________ ____  \nMR LIM GNEE KIANG  \nMember  \nMr Koh Chong Chiah  (in person ) for the Applicants in STB 54 of 2019 . \nMr Koh Ghee Heng (in person) for the Applicants in  STB 55 of 2019.  \nMs Teh Ee -von (M/s Infinitus Law Corporation) for the Respondent .

Instead, the photos  taken  were used to support Mr Lance Ho in \ndiscrediting the Applicants.4 \n \n5. The Applicants\u2019 claims for damages and costs are as follows:  \n \n(a) damages of the sum of  $12,000  in that where nuisance is established, the Applicants \nare entitled to claim for  \u201cthe loss of comfort and enjoyment of (the property )\u201d 5 :  \n(i) with respect to the  seepage  at the ceiling  of the Applicant s\u2019 living room balcony  \nalso referred to as \u201cwater seepage 1\u201d6, the Applicant s were not able to e njoy the \nuse of said balcony  from January 2015 to December 2016 and May 2017 till to -\ndate, they could not  open up  the balcony to entertain their guests nor  place \nfurniture in the balco ny. The said  balcony also looked  unsightly  7; and  \n(ii) with respect to seepage at  the ceiling of the Applicant s\u2019 master bathroom  also \nreferred to as \u201cwater seepage 2\u201d8, it was unsightly, foul water  needed to be \ncleared away , the master bathroom was left u nused  since July 2017 9, and the \nintensity of water seepage  increased  when the occupant of the Respondent\u2019s unit \nused / cleaned the bathroom . 10  \n(b) costs to r epair \u201cwater seepage 1\u201d of $740;  \n(c) fees for consultant / expert of $2,800 ; \n(d) legal costs  and disbursements ; and   \n(e) STB fees of $500 being the Application Fee.  \n \n \n \nRESPONDENT \u2019S CASE  \n \n                                                        \n3 Such as the use of polyurethane grouting to repair water leakages in a Prima Seal Article stated in Mr Roger \nHo\u2019s affidavit, and the manner in which parties carried out the terms of the Consent Order st ated in Mr Lance \nHo\u2019s affidavit.  \n4 Applicants\u2019 Written Submissions undated at paras  22 and 23 . \n5 Id, at para  53. \n6 Id, at para 4.  \n7 Id, at para 35 . \n8 Supra  n 4 at para 4 . \n9 Affidavit of Evidence in Chief of Kumar Balasingam dated 1 August 2019 at para 73.  \n10 Supra  n 4 at para 35 .

The Respondent\u2019s case is that the Applicant s\u2019 claims for damages and costs should be \ndismissed in entirety as the application was \u201coccasioned solely by the Applicants\u2019  \nunreasonable, uncooperative and obstructive conduct \u2013 inter alia, their refusal to provide \nthe Respondent with adequate advance notice for access to #XXX ; their unilateral  \nimposition of conditions on the Respondent\u2019s proposed repair works in #XXX; and their \nrefusal to accommodate any other repair methodology apart from their own (even though \nare not construction experts) .\u201d 11\n7. To elaborate, the Respondent particularised the Applicant s\u2019 conduct as follows  12 :\n(a) the Applicants shut out the Respondent rather than genuinely engaged the Respondent \nto make good the leakages;\n(b) the Applicants set unreasonable timelines for the Respondent to start the repairs which \nmade the expeditious repairs / rectifications impossible;\n(c) the Applicants wanted to dictate the method of repair and undermined the expertise of  \nthe Respondent\u2019s contractor ;\n(d) the Applicants made personal attacks at Mr Lance Ho, the current Chairman of the \nManagement Committee of Nassim Mansion; and\n(e) the Applicants undermined the Respondent\u2019s efforts to carry out its obligations under \nthe Consent Order.\n8. With respect to the Applicants\u2019 prayer for damages of $12,000, the Respondent submitted \nthat as a matter of law, the onus is on the Applicants to show such evidence.13\n9. With respect to the Applicants\u2019 prayer for costs of $740 to repair \u201cwater seepage 1\u201d, the \nRespondent submitted that the said costs were set out in Invoice No. 16-1081 dated 29 \nDecember 2016 issued by NNID Pte Ltd (\u201cNNID \u201d) to the 1st Applicant.14 However, the \nRespondent submitted that the claim is entirely unfounded as the Respondent was willing  \nand able to make good the seepage but for the 1st Applicant\u2019s decision to \u201cshut the door on \nthe Respondent \u201d 15 and that such works carried out were ultimately \u201cineffective \u201d. 16\n11 Respondent\u2019s Written Submission dated 21 August 2019 at para 7(a).  \n12 Id, at paras 14 to 18.  \n13 Id, at para 39.  \n14 Respondent\u2019s Written Submission  dated 21 August 2019 at para 22  and Affidavit of Evidence in Chief of  Ho \nTian Teck Roger dated 25 July 2019 at para 65 . \n15 Respondent\u2019s Written Submission dated 21 August 2019 at para 24.  \n16 Id, at para 25.

With respect to the Applicants\u2019 prayer for consultant / expert fees of $2,800, the Respondent \nsubmit ted that this amount was derived from  three  (3) invoices issued by   LVG Consulting \nPte Ltd  (\u201cLVG \u201d) to the 1st Applicant dated 11 February 2019, 15 February 2019 and 20 \nFebruary 2019 for conduct ing two (2) visual inspections and the preparation / issuance of a \ndefect assessment report dated 20 February 2019.17  However,  the Respondent submit ted that \nthe Applicants ' engagement of LVG was for the purpose of litigation and not with a view to \ncarry out the repair works.18 \n \n11. With respect to the Applicants\u2019 prayer for costs and disbursements, the Respondent \nsubmit ted that liability ha d not been contested and determined agai nst them , that there were  \nexceptions to the general rule that the successful litigant is entitled to costs ; and that the \nRespondent had already agreed to bear the costs and expenses for the repairs / rectification \nworks.19 \n \nBOARD\u2019S DECISION  \n \n12. On the facts of the case, the Board finds that the Applicants have failed to prove any  actual \nloss of comfort and enjoyment .  Accordingly, t he Board dismisse d their prayer for damages  \nof $12,000  as they have failed to prove their claim.  \n \n13. With respect to the cost s of $740 invoiced by NN ID to repair \u201cwater seepage 1\u201d and the fees \nof $2,800 invoiced by LVG  for the consultant / expert , the Board finds that but for the water \nseepages, the Applicants would not have incurred such expenses / suffered such losses .  The \nBoard orders  that the Respondent shou ld reimburse t he Applicants for both invoices \namounting to $3,540.  \n \n14. With respect to legal costs, disbursements and the STB fees of the sum of $500 being the \nApplication Fee, the general principle of awarding cost s to c ompensate the successful litigant \nought to  apply.  The Respondent failed to and/or  did not rebut the statutory presumption in \nSection 101(8) of the BMSMA against a lot immediately above another lot, where there is \n\u201cany evidence of dampness, moisture or water penetration \u201d on the ceiling of the lot below.  \nIn fact, the Respondent had agreed to  rectify the water seepage  issue  in this application  in \nthe Consent Order .  \n \n                                                        \n17 Respondent\u2019s Written Submission dated 21 August 2019  at para 2 6 and Affidavit of Evidence in C hief of  \nVincent Ng dated  30 July 2019 at para 10.  \n18 Respondent\u2019s Written Submission  dated 21 August 2019 at para 28.  \n19 Id, at para 33.

Respondent \n30 July 2019 \n5 September 2019 \nCoram:       Mr. Alfonso Ang  (President) \nMr. Colin Kin  (Member) \nMr. Tony Tay Chye Teck  (Member) \nBACKGROUND \n1 The Applicant is the subsidiary proprietor of a 2-storey residential unit at 91 Lorong G \nTelok Kurau #XXX East Bay Gardens, Singapore 426282 (\u201c the Applicant \u201d).  The \nRespondent is the subsidiary proprietor of residential unit #XXX which is above the \nApplicant\u2019s unit (\u201c the Respondent \u201d). \nORDERS SOUGHT BY THE APPLICANT \n2 The Applicant seeks the following orders:  \n\u201c(1) Respondent to engage at Respondent\u2019s own cost, a building surveyor/structural \nengineer/water seepage specialist to ascertain the water leakages as per the Strata Titles \nBoard\u2019s directions. \n(2) Respondent to ensure all the repair works to Applicant\u2019s unit be done on Saturdays\nonly.

She had provided videos and photographs of the water leakages \nin her affidavit. \n5 The Applicant highlighted that based on the photographs and video taken, the water \nleakage from the Respondent\u2019s unit to her son\u2019s bathroom came from: (a) the concrete \narea surrounding the S-trap pipe and (b) the joint between the S-trap pipe and the \nimmediate surrounding concrete area located above the false ceiling of her son\u2019s \nbathroom. \n6 On 2 January 2019, the Applicant had contacted a plumber from AG Plumber who \ninspected her unit on the same day and inspected the Respondent\u2019s unit the next day. \nHowever, the plumber was unable to make any conclusive finding.1 The Applicant then \ninformed the managing agent of the condominium, who subsequently notified the \nRespondent that they had found the water leakage to be emanating from the Respondent\u2019s \nunit.2 \n7 On 15 February 2019, the Applicant wrote to the Community Mediation Centre to refer \nthe matter for voluntary mediation. However, the Respondent declined to participate.3 \n8 On 20 February 2019 the Applicant filed this application with the Strata Titles Boards \n(\u201cSTB\u201d). \nRESPONDENT\u2019S CASE \n9 The Respondent mentioned that he had responded to the Applicant\u2019s complaint(s) and \nappointed three (3) licensed plumbers and one (1) \u201cSeepage Expert\u201d to investigate and \n1 Affidavit of evidence in chief of Tan Mei Choo dated 17 June 2019 at para 8. \n2 Affidavit of evidence in chief of Tan Mei Choo dated 17 June 2019 at para 9. \n3 Affidavit of evidence in chief of Tan Mei Choo dated 17 June 2019 at para 14. Tan Mei Choo v Tan Yew Lee (Jeremy)  STB No. 22 of 2019 (East Bay Gardens) \n4 test the water leakages\u201d.4  He said that all of them had consistently found that there was \nno water supply pipe leakage.5 \n10 The Respondent had intended to call one Ng Yee Hong (\u201c Mr. Ng\u201d), a licensed plumber \nto give evidence. Mr. Ng\u2019s affidavit of evidence in chief was also submitted to the Board. \nHowever, on the day of hearing, Mr. Ng did not turn up. Accordingly, his evidence is \ndisregarded.  \n11 The Respondent then called one Kwan Sai Hong, Jasper (\u201c Mr. Kwan \u201d) who was \ndescribed by the Respondent as the \u201cSeepage Expert\u201d6. Mr. Kwan gave evidence to the \nBoard in his personal capacity, and not as a practising architect. \n12 On 18 January 2019, Mr. Kwan was asked by the Respondent to carry out an inspection \nregarding water seepage on the false ceiling of the Applicant\u2019s bath/WC. He also prepared \na report dated 28 January 2019 based on his \u201cnon-intrusive\u201d methods of inspection and \nthe four (4) methods/procedures he used are as follows7: \na Visual observation;  \nb Touch and feel with fingers; \nc Use infrared thermal camera to scan for any temperature differences on the surface; \nand  \nd Use moisture meters to measure moisture content on the surface and inside of the \nwall. \n13 In summary, Mr. Kwan stated in both his report and in his affidavit of evidence in chief \ndated 20 June 2019 that: \na The insulation which was supposed to be wrapped onto the floor trap was removed; \nb The use of an infrared thermal camera to scan for water presence on the wall or \nfloor in the Applicant\u2019s unit as well as on the wall of the Respondent\u2019s unit did not \nreveal any presence of water. Therefore, there is no water leakage from the \nRespondent\u2019s water pipe; and \nc The ice-water test conducted on the floor trap (uninsulated) resulted in \ncondensation forming on the floor trap. This gave rise to water dripping from the \nfloor trap to the Applicant\u2019s unit. \n14 During the hearing, Mr. Kwan gave evidence based on his report of 28 January 2019 that \nwater leakage could be due to: \na Condensation arising from air-conditioning condensate since the insulation on the \n4 Affidavit of evidence in chief of Tan Yew Lee (Jeremy) dated 21 June 2019 at page 7. \n5 Ibid. \n6 Ibid. \n7 Affidavit of evidence in chief of Kwan Sai Hong, Jasper dated 20 June 2019 at page 5. Tan Mei Choo v Tan Yew Lee (Jeremy)  STB No. 22 of 2019 (East Bay Gardens) \n5 floor trap had been removed; and \nb Condensation from water droplets on the floor trap which resulted from rising warm \nair during hot showers taken in the Applicant\u2019s windowless bathroom through a \nsmall hole in the false ceiling. \n15 It appears from the evidence of the Respondent\u2019s expert witness that the water leakage \nwas due to condensation on the water pipe situated above the false ceiling of the \nApplicant\u2019s unit, which was not insulated. \nBOARD\u2019S FINDINGS \n16 Having considered the submissions and evidence presented at the hearing, the Board \nmakes the below findings of fact. \nWater leakage emanating from Respondent\u2019s unit to Applicant\u2019s unit \n17 The Board finds that there is ample evidence that water had emanated from the \nRespondent\u2019s unit and seeped into the Applicant\u2019s unit. The photographs taken by and \nthe videos recorded by the Applicant showed that there was water dripping from the area \naround the floor trap, the bottom of the floor trap as well as the ceiling board of the \nApplicant\u2019s unit onto the wall and into a container from the Respondent\u2019s unit above. \n18 The Respondent does not dispute the presence of water in the Applicant\u2019s unit. However, \nhe attributes the presence of water to condensation in the Applicant\u2019s unit and not to any \nleakage.  In fact, the Respondent\u2019s expert witness, Mr. Kwan, had stated in his affidavit \nof evidence in chief that there was water emanating from the Respondent\u2019s unit to the \nApplicant\u2019s unit during the ice-water test conducted on the Respondent\u2019s floor trap. \nRespondent\u2019s onus to rebut statutory presumption \n19 Section 101(8) of the BMSMA states as follows: \n\u201c(8) In any proceedings under this section with respect to any alleged defect \nin a lot or in any common property or limited common property situated \nimmediately (whether wholly or partly) above another lot or any common \nproperty or limited common property, it shall be presumed, in the absence \nof proof to the contrary, that the defect is within that lot or common property \nor limited common property, as the case may be, above if there is any \nevidence of dampness, moisture or water penetration -  \n(a)on the ceiling that forms part of the interior of the lot, common\nproperty or limited common property, as the case may be,\nimmediately below; or\n(b)on any finishing material (including plaster, panel or gypsum\nboard) attached, glued, laid or applied to the ceiling that forms\npart of the interior of the lot, common property or limited\ncommon property, as the case may be, immediately below.\u201dTan Mei Choo v Tan Yew Lee (Jeremy)  STB No. 22 of 2019 (East Bay Gardens) \n6 20 Pursuant to section 101(8) of the BMSMA, the Respondent had the onus to rebut the \nstatutory presumption so long as there is any evidence of dampness, moisture or water \npenetration to the lower unit. \nRespondent\u2019s failure to rebut statutory presumption \n21 The Board notes that although Mr. Kwan confirmed his status as an architect, he also \nmentioned in his affidavit that he \u201c currently specialise in detecting water seepage in \nbuildings.\u201d8 The Board notes that Mr. Kwan gave evidence in his personal capacity and \nnot as a practising architect. \n22 During the hearing, Mr. Kwan had named five (5) common tests which he would \nnormally perform to detect water leakage. He had only performed two (2) out of the five \n(5) tests, namely the infrared and ice water tests, and was unable to detect the source of\nwater leakage from the Respondent\u2019s unit to the Applicant\u2019s unit.\n23 When questioned by Applicant\u2019s Counsel on why he did not perform the other standard \nindustry practice tests to detect water seepage, Mr. Kwan gave evidence during the \nhearing that he would \u201c\u2026 look at the water seepage pattern first then recommend\u2026don\u2019t \nthink necessary [to conduct other tests] from [his] experience .\u201d  The Board finds that he \nwas merely validating what he thought was the cause of the seepage and refused to do \nother standard industry practice tests to ascertain the real cause of the seepage.   \n24 Upon further questioning by the Applicant\u2019s Counsel, Mr. Kwan had in fact replied that, \nin consideration of the water leakage pattern, there was a possibility that water leakage \ncould be due to air-conditioning usage. However, he did not perform other such tests to \nverify that the water leakage was not from the air-conditioning usage. Accordingly, it was \nquestionable whether Mr. Kwan had performed thorough and/or extensive test(s) in order \nto determine and/or verify the source of water leakage. \n25 The Board also notes that after this Application was filed with the STB, the Respondent \ndid not engage a qualified building surveyor to inspect the Applicant\u2019s unit and his own \nunit, despite knowing that the Applicant continued to face the problem of water leakage \nseeping into her unit.  In respect of this, it is the Applicant\u2019s evidence that water leakage \nwas observed up until 20 May 2019 after the Applicant had filed her application with the \nSTB on 20 February 2019. \nBOARD\u2019S DECISION \n26 The Board finds that the Respondent had not rebutted the statutory presumption under \nsection 101(8) of the BMSMA and remains liable.  \n27 The Board hereby orders that: \na The Respondent shall engage, at his own costs, within two (2) weeks from the date \nof this order an independent building surveyor  agreed upon by the Applicant to \n8 Affidavit of evidence in chief of Kwan Sai Hong, Jasper dated 20 June 2019 at para 1.

The Applicant is the subsidiary proprietor of Block 481 #XXX Castle Green \nCondominium (\u201cthe Applicant\u201d). The Respondent is the Management Corporation of \nCastle Green Condominium (\u201cthe Respondent \u201d). The Applicant applied for a renovation  \npermit from the Respondent.\n2. Section 2 \u201cRenovation\u201d of the by-laws of Castle Green Condominium (\u201cCastle Green \u201d) \nstates that:Low Yung Chyuan v The MCST Plan No. 2178  STB No. 20 of 2019  (Castle Green ) \n3 \u201cResidents shall not carry out any work which may affect the external fa\u00e7ade of the \nbuild ing without prior written approval of the Management. Fa\u00e7ade shall include \nwindows, curved windows in the living room, window grill, wash area, common areas, \nopen areas and all other visible parts of the building which constitute or form part of \nthe extern al appearance of the building.\u201d   \n3. The Respondent approved the Applicant\u2019s application for the said permit on or about 21\nSeptember 2018.  On 23 September 2018, the Applicant wrote to the Respondent seeking\napproval for the installation of the sliding windows.  From October to December  2018,\nboth the Applicant and the Respondent  (\u201cthe parties \u201d) communicated  and/or\ncorrespond ed on the installation of the slid ing windows.\n4. On 2 January 2019, the Applicant applied for an extension of the renovation permit but\nher application was rejected by the Respondent on 15 January 2019. The Applicant then\nfiled her application on 14 February 2019 with the Strata Titles Boards (\u201c STB \u201d).\n5. The Applicant sought the following orders in her application to the STB pursuant to\nSection 111(b) of the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act (\u201c BMSMA \u201d),\nnamely:\n\u201c1) To permit retention of installation of aluminium sliding window at yard opening.  \n2)To permit without further delay, completion of outstanding renovation works as per \napproved Renovation Permit no. 1909118/481 # XXX, dated 21/09/18.\n3)To claim $500 application fee and any subsequent costs incurred pertaining to this \napplication; from the respondent. \u201d\n6. The issue with respect to the renovation permit  was resolved at mediation so that at the\ntime of the hearing, the main issue to be decided by the Board was whether to grant an\norder to the Applicant for the installation of slidi ng windows at her yard opening.\nParties\u2019 cases \n7. In summary,  the Applicant\u2019s case is that where the uniformity of the building can no\nlonger be preserved and there is no benefit to be gained by the management corporation,\nit would be unreasonable for the management corporation to withhold consent to the\nimprovement works. 1  The Applicant  submitted that  the Respondent had permitted the\ninstallation of windows, grilles, screens, netting,  blinds etc. for other subsidiary\nproprietors, in particular allowing windows  for ground floor units, but did not approve the\nApplicant\u2019s application for the same .  She made four key submissions in support of her\napplication  2 :\n1 Applicant\u2019s Closing Submissions dated 23 August 2019 at para 9.  \n2 Applicant\u2019s Opening Statement dated 2 August 2019 at para 11.  Low Yung Chyuan v The MCST Plan No. 2178           STB No. 20 of 2019  (Castle Green ) \n \n4 \n (a) The Respondent had permitte d the installation of the yard windows for other \nsubsidiary prop rietors prior to the Applicant\u2019s application to the STB ; \n \n(b) The Respondent did not consider ground floor units that had installed windows as \nhaving violated the by -laws; \n \n(c) The Respondent permitted grilles of different designs to be installed even though it \nhad issued guidelines on a certain design and colo ur for the grilles; and  \n \n(d) The Respondent permitted screens, netting and blinds to be installed at the yard.  \n \n8. In response, the Respondent made the following arguments  3 : \n \n(a) In the Applicant\u2019s application for the renovation permit, the Applicant had not set \nout the proposed installation of the sliding windows which had to be gleaned from \nthe supporting documents to the application form. This b elied the Applicant\u2019s \nrecognition that there would be an issue with the sliding windows ; \n \n(b) From October to December 2018, when the parties communicated and/or \ncorresponded on the sliding windows, t he Applicant had been orally informed by \nthe Managing Agent\u2019s (\u201cMA\u201d) Mr Allan Neo that her proposed installation of the \nsliding windows was not approved but the Applicant disputed this and was of the \nview  that her application for the sliding windows was pending.  \n \nThe Respondent submitted that it was  untrue  that the Applicant could have \nconstrued her application as pending when the Applicant had written  to the \nRespondent stating that \u201c one of the proposed works (installation of new sliding \nwindows to the yard area) was n ot approved.4\u201d The Applicant had installed the \nsliding windows despite being aware that the same were not approved in repeated  \nreminders from the MA;  \n \n(c) The Applicant had been given reasonable opportunity to present her case for the \ninstallation of the sliding windows to the subsidiary proprietors of Castle Green and \nto table a motion for this  at the 20th Annual General Meeting  (\u201cAGM \u201d) of 29 June \n2019 .  The subsidiary proprietors of Castle Green had voted against the installation \nof the sliding windows  with the following results : \n \n\u201cFor: 180 shares values (46.2%)  \nAgainst: 209 shares values (53.73%)  5\u201d; and \n \n(d) The Applicant had promised to remove the sliding windows  on two ( 2) occasions:  \n \n(i) in the Applicant\u2019s  email dated 16 January 2019 , the Applicant requested to \nmeet the Management Council and that if the Management Council refused to \n                                                        \n3 Respondent\u2019s Opening Statement dated 5 August 2019 at paras 9 to 13.  \n4 Affidavit of evidence in c hief of Kwok Siew Lin, Shirley dated 18 July 2019 at para 12 & Tab B.  \n5 Affidavit of evidence in chief of Amanda Gladys Ang Yan Peng dated 18 July 2019 at para 25 & Tab E.

The following three ( 3) issues arose before the Board under Section 111(b) of the Building \nMaintenance and Strata Management Act (\u201c BMSMA \u201d) for their determination : \n \n(a) First, whether the Applicant\u2019s sliding windows affect the appearance  of the building \nfor Castle Green  (Section 37(3), BMSMA) ; \n \n(b) Second, where the Applicant\u2019s sliding windows affect the appearance of the \nbuilding, whether the Applicant\u2019s sliding windows detract from the appearance of \nthe building  or if it is in keeping with the rest of the building  (Section 37(4) , \nBMSMA ); and  \n \n(c) Third, even i f the Applicant\u2019s sliding windows detract or is not in keeping with the \nrest of the building, whether there is any other reason to allow the Applicant\u2019s \nsliding windows.  An example would be  Section 3 7A, BMSMA.  \n \nWhether the sliding windows affect the appearance of the building for Castle Green  \n \n10. In Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 1378 v Chen Ee Yueh Rachel  [1993] 3 \nSLR(R) 630 (\u201c Chen Ee Yueh \u201d), Chao Hick Tan J (as he then was) was of the view that \nthe balcony and windows are building features which are visible from the exterior. In \nChen Ee Yueh  at [16] and [17], the learned Judge held that sliding windows are \npermanently affixed onto the balcony and that they do affect the overa ll appearance of the \nbuilding.  The test applied in Chen Ee Yueh  in determining whether the sliding windows \naffect the external appearance of the building depended on \u201c the degree of permanence \nwith which the addition or alteration is annexed to the original structure of the balcony.\u201d  \n \n11. It is not in dispute that the Applicant\u2019s sliding windows are permanently affixed to her \nyard and that the structural integrity of the building would not be affected by the \nApplicant\u2019s installation of the sliding window s. The sliding windows do affect the \nexternal appearance of Castle Green  and the Applicant had installed the sliding windows \nin late November 2018 without the Respondent\u2019s approval ,6 with the evidence suggesting \nthat parties were still trying to come to an  agreement on the application at that time.  The \nRespondent only made up its mind to reject the application in late December 201 8 and \nwrote to the Applicant on 15 January 201 9.7  Therefore, pursuant to Section 2 \n\u201cRenovation\u201d of the by -laws of Castle Green, the Applicant should not have carried out \nthe installation of the sliding windows without approval from the Respondent.  \n                                                        \n6 Respondent\u2019s Closing Submissions dated 23 August 2019 at para 49.  \n7 See Transcript page 52 Lines 1 to 11, Page 53 Lines 9 to 21.  Low Yung Chyuan v The MCST Plan No. 2178           STB No. 20 of 2019  (Castle Green ) \n \n6 \n Where the sliding windows affect the appearance of the bu ilding, whether they detract from \nthe appearance of the building or are in keeping with the rest of the building  \n \n12. Even though the Applicant should not have carried out the installation of the sliding \nwindows without the Respondent\u2019s approval  (see para 11 a bove) , the Board was of the \nview that the Applicant\u2019s  installation of the sliding windows did not detract from the \nappearance of the building .  These are elaborated below.  \n \n13. In Management  Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 940 v Lim Florence Marjorie [2018]  \nSGHC 254 (\u201c Lim Florence \u201d), the High Court had discussed Sec tion 37(3), BMSMA and \nheld at [74] that \u201c [D]eter mining whether renovations affect the appearance of a building \nis a factual exercise, undertaken by comparing the fa\u00e7ade presented  by the flat in question \nwith the fa\u00e7ade presented by other similar flat s and by all of the flats as a whole: \nManagement Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 1786 v Huang Hsiang Shui [2006] SGDC \n20 at [112])\u201d.  Further at [75]  of Lim Florence , the High Court hel d that \u201c [W]hether an \nimprovement effect ed to a particular flat affects the fa\u00e7ade of its building is not to be \nascertained as a theoretical exercise but from the viewpoint of a reasonable observer who \nlooks at the building from the position which is practi cally possible or likely.\u201d  The High \nCourt in Lim Florence decided based on the evidence of the photographs  that there was a \ndiscernible variance between the fa\u00e7ade presented by the defendant\u2019s flat and the fa\u00e7ade \npresented by all the other flats in her bl ock, both individually and taken as a whole.8    \n \n14. Although Lim Florence is not a case on Section 111(b) BMSMA and the question of \nwhether the Respondent acted reasonably is not engaged  9, the view of the Court on \ncomparing the fa\u00e7ade presented by the flat in question with other similar flats and all the \nflats as a whole, is instructive.  \n \n15. A look at the photographs relevant to the fa\u00e7ade in question in the Applicant\u2019s Bundle of \nDocuments at pages 3 to 13 shows the following : \n \n(a) Firstly, ground floor unit s were allowed to  install sliding windows at their yard s.   \n \n(i) In the affidavit of evidence in chief of Amanda Gladys Ang Yan Peng  \n(\u201cAmanda \u201d) dated 18 July 2019 at [45], it was stated : \n \n\u201cThe MCST allows for installation of Window Grilles at the yard, which \nwould ad dress all the Applicant\u2019s stated concerns regarding safety and/or \nsecurity .\u201d \n \n(ii) Further, in Amanda\u2019s reply affidavit dated 26 July 2019 at [26], it was stated :   \n                                                        \n8 Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 940 v Lim Florence Marjorie [2018] SGHC 254 at para 77.  \n9 Ibid at para 90.  Low Yung Chyuan v The MCST Plan No. 2178           STB No. 20 of 2019  (Castle Green ) \n \n7 \n \u201c\u2026I noted at paragraph 24 of Low\u2019s AEIC that the Applicant took issue \nwith how issue with how the ground floor units are permitted to install yard \nwindows.  This is because unlike upper floor units (like the Unit), a yard \non the ground floor faces the additi onal problem of privacy.  The \nManagement Council took into account this consideration and permitted \ninstallation of yard windows only in relation to ground floor units\u2026 \u201d \n \n(iii) At the hearing, the Respondent failed to adequately substantiate  and respond \nto how the installation of windows at the ground floor units was to address \ntheir privacy .  \n \nAs provided in the testimony of Kwok Siew Lin, Shirley (\u201c Shirley \u201d):   \n \n\u201cQ --sliding windows to be installed.  And I understand that part of your \nanswer was that for reaso ns of privacy, right?  \nA Positive. It was \u2013 we were informed by the Council . \nQ Now as a managing agent with some nine years of experience, can \nyou tell the Board what is your understanding of this reason of \nprivacy that lead to the ground floor units being approved to install \nsliding windows?  \nA The sliding windows at level 1 was approved before P FS took over.  \nSo we just follow suit .10 \n\u2026 \nQ How does sliding windows help to improve privacy?  Maybe I help \nto guide you, from your understanding?  \nA Okay, they also mentioned that not only privacy, they also mentioned \nthat to prevent splatters of rain entering into their unit.  That is why \nthe Council has approved it.  But from my understanding, that for \nlevel 1 privacies, it\u2019s they are not \u2013 so that the residents tha t walk \npasses bv are not able to see what they are doing inside... So there is \na sense of privacies.  \nQ So that is your understanding of protecting the privacy of the \nresidents in the unit?  \nA At level 1.  \nQ By installing windows?  \n                                                        \n10 Transcript of 14th August 2019 at Page 94 Line s 4 to 14.

Because the windows are pretty low . \nQ Okay, maybe you got to help us understand. How does installing \nwindows help to prevent people from looking in?  \nA Because when you walk past, people tends to peep into the units.  \nQ That I understand.  But how does installing windows prevent that?  \nA They also have this - - they also prevent rain . \nQ That I understand . \nA Yah. \nQ It\u2019s in fact one of the reasons the applicant wants to install windows, \nto prevent rain.  But let\u2019s not go into that.   I mean I am  more \ninterested in the issue of privacy.  For example, if what you say, your \nunderstanding is to prevent busybodies from looking into the unit, \nwouldn\u2019t an opaque covering be more important than windows?  \nA Most of them were opaque, most of th em. \nQ You know, like blinds or curtains to prevent people from looking in.  \nSo why windows? I don\u2019t understand.  \nA The design was actually approved by the Council . 11 \n\u2026 \nQ -- and seeing what\u2019s inside, from your experience and your \nknowledge, not whichever Council, your own experience and \nunderstanding, which is the best way to prevent people from the \noutside looking in to a unit?  From your own experience and \nknowledge.  \nA Okay, let\u2019s say for the blinds, when the wind blow, there\u2019s the blinds \nwill flap up. So people still can look into the unit.  So with the sliding \nwindows and curtains or if they put a shield, then we cannot see \ninside the unit.  \nQ So if they install blinds, t hen the blind shouldn\u2019t be moveable.  \nA When the wind blow, yah, then  \u2013 \nQ Are there blinds that you can  - -  \nA Ziptrak, that is Ziptrak.  Ziptrak, because what happened is that \nZiptrak, how it works is that it\u2019s motorised, it works along together \n                                                        \n11 Transcript of 14th August 2019 at Page 95 Line 1 to Page 96 Line 17.  Low Yung Chyuan v The MCST Plan No. 2178  STB No. 20 of 2019  (Castle Green ) \n9 with the f rame, it comes down together with the frame.  So no matter \nhow the wind blow, it will not flip . \nQ So there are alternatives to installing a window?  \nA Yah. \nQ If your idea is to protect privacy and not let people look in.  \nA Yah, that is Ziptrak . \nQ Is there a  requirement that the ground floor window units install \ntinted windows, that means windows that are opaque?  Is that a \nrequirement for Castle Green?  \nA Currently, no, there\u2019s no requirement.  \nQ So they can install clear windows?  \nA Yah.12 \nBased on Shirley\u2019s testimony  above , the installation of windows  (or clear \nwindows)  at the ground floor units was allowed before the new managing \nagent  (i.e. Property Facility Services Pte Ltd or PFS)  took over , was approv ed \nby the Management Council, and the  windows  were mea nt to  prevent the \npasser -by from looking into the  ground floor units .  To address the problem \nof privacy, the ground floor units would have to install frosted/tinted/opaque \nwindows and/or blinds to prevent a passer -by from looking into  their units.  It \nwas not clear  to the Board as to any reasonable basis for allowing ground floor \nunits to instal l clear sliding windows and not other units. The Board was  \ntherefore  of the view that there was no reason why the Applicant should be \ntreated differently from the ground floor units  and denied the installation of \nsliding windows at her yard.  \n(b) Secondl y, there was approval/acquiescence by the Respondent for installation of \nsliding yard windows and other features affecting the facade.\n(i) Unit #XXX at Block 481 was allowed to install sliding yard windows in \nAugust 2018 13. This seems to have been downplayed by the Respondent, \nwho belatedly in March 2019, after this application was made, issued a letter  \nto the owner(s) to remove unapproved windows. 14\n(ii) Further, when asked about whether the MCST had taken action or issued \nany letters against subsidiary proprietors that had installed grilles of different  \ncolor and design that did not conform to the guidelines, Amanda repeated  \nthat this was \u201cin progress\u201d15.  Shirley also confirms that as far as she knows,\n12 Transcript of 14th August 2019 at Page 97 Line 9 to Page 98 Line 15.  \n13 Applicant\u2019s bundle of documents at pages 15 and 16.  \n14 Transcript of 14th August 2019 at Page 67 Lines 4 to 14.  \n15 Transcript of 14th August 2019 at Page 88 Line 4, Page 88 Line 8.  Low Yung Chyuan v The MCST Plan No. 2178           STB No. 20 of 2019  (Castle Green ) \n \n10 \n prior to the letters sent out on 12 March 2019 (after the Applicant\u2019s \napplication was filed with the STB), no  letters were sent to owners with \nunauthorised yard windows asking them to remove the said windows. 16 \n \n(iii) It therefore appears to the Board that the Respondent has, for reasons best \nknown to them, allowed subsidiary proprietors who have installed a variety \nof items affecting the fa\u00e7ade, to do so for a considerable period of time \nwithout approval.  \n \n(c) Third ly, there are other yard units with a variety of installations. It is clear to the \nBoard the building of Castle Green could not be said to be aesthetically uniform as \nscreens, blinds,  different designs in grilles, n etting and Ziptrak were  already \ninstalled , provided in Shirley\u2019s  testimony at the hearing of 14 August 201 9: \n \nQ -- I put it to you that the MCST is agreeable to allowing screens, nettings \nand blinds to be installed at the yard.  Do you agree?  \nA Screen, netting s. Mosquito net is okay, to my understanding . \nQ Blinds as well?  \nA Recently, they approved one is Ziptrak . \nQ Which is a kind of blind, right?  \nA Yes, yes . \nQ And that\u2019s allowed, Ziptrak is allowed?  \nA Yes, yes .17  \n\u2026 \nQ That\u2019s Ziptrak?  \nA Yes, positive  \nQ So these are motorised screens?  \nA Yes, with frames.  \nQ And there\u2019s no grille in front, right?  \nA No grille.  \nQ And the frames are fixed, I mean the Ziptrak is held by frames at the side \nand they are fixed, correct?  \nA Yes, positive.  \nQ And I put it to you that these screens and blinds, they detract from the \nappearance of the building even more than a plain glass wi ndow.  Would \nyou agree?

Do you \nagree?  \nA The nettings is removable item, it\u2019s as what the Council had suggested to \nher, that she can install the nettings to prevent mosquitoes or insects from \nentering . \nQ Yes, but what about the grilles of different design \u2013 \nA The windows, the  \u2013 \nQ -- there is no more uniformity in appearance, do you agree?  \nA I agree, but that\u2019s why we are working on it .19 ; \n \nAside from the admission by the Respondent, t he Board is further fortified in its \nview that the Applicant\u2019s installation of the sliding windows would not detract from \nthe aesthetic uniformity of the building of Castle Green on a visual inspection  of the \nphotographs of the Applicant\u2019 s unit in its proper context when situated amongst \nseveral other units that had installed screens, blinds, different designs in grilles, \nnetting and Ziptrak within the  recessed yard area of the building20;  and in applying \nthe test that whether an improvement effe cted to a flat affecting the fa\u00e7ade of its \nbuilding is not to be ascertained as a theoretical exercise but from  \u201cthe viewpoint of \na reasonable observer who looks at the building fro m a position which is practically \npossible or likely.21\u201d (see para 13 above).  \n \n(d) Fourth ly, the AGM resolution was not unequivocal  unlike Lim Florence where a \nunanimous resolution was obtained to take action against the subsidiary proprietors \nto ensure that they reinstate their b alconies to the original design.  T he Board was \nof the view that at the 20th AGM, the motion that was tabled was ambiguous and \nconfusing.   \n \nThe following motion was tabled  at the 20th AGM : \n \n\u201c11.2 Yard Window  \n                                                        \n18 Transcript of  14th August 2019  at Page 8 9 Lines 8 to 24.  \n19 Transcript of 14th August 2019 at Page 91 Line 17 to Page 92 Line 8.  \n20 Applicant\u2019s bundle of documents at pages 3 to 13.  \n21 Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 940 v Lim Florence Marjorie  [2018] SGHC 254 at para [77].  Low Yung Chyuan v The MCST Plan No. 2178           STB No. 20 of 2019  (Castle Green ) \n \n12 \n To consider and if approved, resolve by way of Special Resolution to allow \nonly sliding windows to be installed at the yard.  When there are both windows \nand grilles, the grilles need to be installed on the outside.  \n \nThis proposed by -law (11.2) if passed would be added into the existing by -\nlaws on installation of windows.  \n \nThis proposed by -law (11.2)  if not passed would empower the Management \nCouncil to take legal proceedings against unit(s) in violation and such legal \nfees, disbursements and incidental costs, incurred in the legal proceedings \nshall be recovered from the Su bsidiary Proprietors concern ed.\u201d22 \n \nThe motion to allow only sliding windows to be installed at the yard was \nfundamentally different in nature / content / character with a motion to allow the \nmanagement corporation to commence legal proceedings against units that were in \nviolation of the ins tallation of sliding windows at the yard.   \n \nThe Board agrees with the Applicant\u2019s submissions that the above motion may be \ninherently unfair wherein the general body had been asked to vote on two issues \nwith one vote i.e. whether to permit windows to be installed at the yard and whether \nto take lega l proceedings against the installation of the windows. 23 However, t he \nBoard finds that it will not be necessary to decide on whether the resolution made \non this motion is invalid or should be repealed as this was not part of the Applicant\u2019s \napplication.  \n \n16. Further, a s stated in Zou Xiong v MCST Plan No. 2360 [2017] SGSTB 5 (\u201c Zou Xiong \u201d) \nat [31], it would not necessary to hold an AGM to approve the Applicant\u2019s installation of \nsliding windows at her yard:  \n \n\u201cIt is the Respondent\u2019s  (i.e. the management corporation\u2019s) role to put in place a set \nof design guidelines for the installation of safety grilles that address both the safety \nissues and the issues regarding the fa\u00e7ade of the Development, so that the subsidiary \nproprietors can c omply with such guidelines. Where there is no design guidelines, \nthe subsidiary proprietor\u2019s application for the installation of the invisible grilles \nhave to be decided on a case -by-case basis.  In exercising its power, the Respondent \nshould not defer its  responsibility to the general body .\u201d \n \n17. The Board finds that it was not necessary for the Respondent to hold an AGM in order to \ndecide on the Applicant\u2019s installation of the sliding windows at her yard.   Further, there \n                                                        \n22 Affidavit of evidence in chief of Amanda Gladys Ang Yan Peng dated 18 July 2019 at para 20.  \n23 Applicant\u2019s Closing Submissions dated 23 August 2019 at para 54(h).  Low Yung Chyuan v The MCST Plan No. 2178           STB No. 20 of 2019  (Castle Green ) \n \n13 \n were already design guidelines provide d by the Respondent. The Respondent could decide \non a case -by-case basis without the need for an AGM.  \n \n18. Section 37(4) of the BMSMA states that : \n \n\u201cA management corporation may, at the request of a subsidiary proprietor of any \nlot comprised in its strata title plan and upon such terms as it considers appropriate, \nauthorise the subsidiary proprietor to effect any improvement in or upon his lot\u2026if \nthe management corporation is satisfied  that the improvement in or upon the lot - \n(a) will not detract from the appearance of any of the buildings comprised in the \nstrata title plan or will be in keeping with the rest of the buildings; and  \n(b) will not affect the structural integrity of any of the buildings comprised in the \nstrata title plan.\u201d  \n \n19. The Board is of the view  that Section 37(4) purports to prevent subsidiary proprietors \nfrom making alterations or improvements to their respective lots in order to maintain a \nuniform appearance and fa\u00e7ade with the rest of the building and to ensure that subsidiary \nproprieto rs adh ere to the structural integrity of the building. Where the Applicant\u2019s \ninstallation of sliding windows does not detract from the appearance or is in keeping with \nthe rest of the building , and where  there is no dispute that the installation of windows does \nnot affect the structural integrity of the buildings , the onus falls on the Respondent to have \na reasonable basis for rejecting the application, based on the facts and appearance of the \nbuildings in question.    \n \n20. The Respondent\u2019s exercise of its discretion in not approving the Applicant\u2019s installation \nof sliding windows at her yard is arguably unreasonable  when the same sliding windows \nwere allowed for ground floor units  (see para 15 (a) above), and where installations of \nscreens, blinds, different  designs in grilles, netting and Zi ptrack were permitted  (see para \n15(c) above). The Board is of the view that the Applicant\u2019s installation of clear  sliding  \nwindows could not be said to detract further from the aesthetic uniformit y of Castle Green .  \n \n21. It appears that the Respondent may have lacked objectivity and also acted unreasonably \nin dealing with the Applicant\u2019s request for an extension of time for her renovation permit, \ngoing so far as to disregard the advice of the Managing Agent.  24 The Board al so noted \nthat no other subsidiary proprietor has written in to complain about the Applicant\u2019s sliding \nwindows.25   \n \n \n                                                        \n24 Transcript of 14th August 2019 at Page 58 Line  20 to Page 59 Line 22.  \n25 Transcript of 14th August 2019 at Page 60 Line s 4 to 6.  Low Yung Chyuan v The MCST Plan No. 2178           STB No. 20 of 2019  (Castle Green ) \n \n14 \n Where the sliding windows detract from the appearance of the building or are not in keeping \nwith the rest of the building, whether there are  any other reasons to allow for the said windows  \n22. It would not be necessary for the Board to find whether there are any other reasons to \nallow the Applicant\u2019s installation for the sliding windows g iven that the Board has found \nthe Applicant\u2019s installation of sliding windows does not detract from the appearance of \nthe building and is in keeping in the rest of the building .  \n \nConclusion  \n \n23. Section 111(b) of the BMSMA, states:  \n \n\u201cWhere, pursuant to an app lication by a subsidiary proprietor, a Board considers \nthat the management corporation or subsidiary management corporation to which \nthe application relates - \n(b) has unreasonably refused to authorise under Section 37(4) any improvement in \nor upon a lot whi ch affects the appearance of any building comprised in the strata \ntitle plan,  \nthe Board may make an order that the management corporation or subsidiary \nmanagement corporation, as the case may be, consents to the proposal .\u201d \n \n24. Pursuant to Section 111(b) of the BMSMA, a subsidiary proprietor may apply to STB for \nan order that t he management corpo ration give consent for the improvement in her lot \nwhere her application under Section 37(4) of the BMSMA has been unreasonably refused.   \nIt was the Applicant\u2019s submission that her proposal for installation of yard windows w as \npending and the Respondent\u2019s submissions that her proposal was not approved.  Be that \nas it may , the fact is that the Respondent had not authorise d and had refused  the \nApplicant\u2019s proposal to effect improvements i.e. install  clear  sliding windows in or upon \nher lot.  \n \n25. As the Board had  earlier  determined : \n  \n(a) that the improvement works (i.e. the installation of the clear sliding wind ows at the \nApplicant\u2019s yard) do  not detract from the appearance of the building and are in \nkeeping with the rest of the building  in view of the prior state of the fa\u00e7ade of the \nrecessed yard areas , where other units had already installed  clear sliding windows,  \nscreens, blinds, different  designs in grilles, netting and Ziptrack , which the \nRespondent had approved  or had not taken action against ; and \n  \n(b) that there is no reasonable basis to not consent to  or refuse the Applicant\u2019s proposal , \n  \nthe Board  finds the Respondent to have unreasonably refused the Applicant\u2019s application \nto install sliding windows at her yard and  orders the Respondent to consent to  the same .

The Board reminds all Council members to act objectively and dispassionately in carryin g \nout their duties under the BMSMA, with any notions of personal differences and/or \nopinions to be put aside.  It may not be an easy task, as most Council members are lay -\npersons and volunteers.

This is a dispute between two subsidiary proprietors and the management corporation  \nover the installation of a fixed awning.  The resident upstairs is distressed over inter alia \nthe noise in relation to the fixed awning, installed by her neighbour who lives below,  \nwhen it rains. Her neighbour maintains that the fixed awning is necessary to protect him  \nfrom \u201ckiller\u201d  litter i.e. objects thrown or falling from high buildings which endangers the \npeople below .  He also relies on the fact that the installation of the fixed awning had been \nallowed by the management corporation\u2019s  council members.\n2. Ms. Rosalina Soh Pei Xi (\u201cthe Applicant\u201d) is the subsidiary proprietor of a unit #XXX \nin the condominium development known as Suites @ Newton (\u201cthe Development\u201d) . The \n1st Respondent is Mr. Hui Mun Wai who is the subsidiary proprietor of a unit #XXX in \nthe Development.  On 18 February 2019, the Applicant filed an interlocutory application  \nto add the Management Corporation Strata Plan No. 4396 (\u201cthe MCST\u201d) of the \nDevelopment as the 2nd Respondent in these proceedings for an order that the 1st \nRespondent remove the fixed awning at his sky terrace.\n3. To understand the dispute, it is useful to describe the context in which the fixed awning \nwas installed. On 6 May 2017, the MCST held its 1st Annual General Meeting (\u201c1st \nAGM\u201d) where the Applicant and the 1st Respondent were appointed as the Treasurer and \nChairman of the 1st Management Council (\u201cMC\u201d), respectively.  The issue of water \nseepage to the sky terrace units, which included the 1st Respondent\u2019s unit, was raised at \nthe 1st AGM and subsequently at the 1st council meeting on 22 May 2017.\n4. At the 2nd council meeting on 21 July 2017, the then Managing Agent, M/s Affinity \nProperty Consultants Pte. Ltd. (\u201cthe Previous MA \u201d), informed the MC that they had \nadvised the subsidiary proprietors of the sky terrace units, including the 1st Respondent\u2019s \nunit, on the relevant documents for the proposed installation of a fixed awning (\u201cthe \nInstallation\u201d), applicable for units with a Private Enclosed Space area.\n5. On 5 October 2017, by way of email, the MA sought approval from the MC on the \nInstallation at the 1st Respondent\u2019s unit. The email comprised attachments of an \nimage/photo and drawing of the fixed awning, a floor plan, and emails from the 1st \nRespondent on checks of the requirements by the Building and Construction Authority \n(\u201cBCA\u201d) and the Urban Redevelopment Authority (\u201cURA\u201d) for the Installation.  On the  \nsame day , the 1st Respondent, the Applicant and Ms. Foo Kit Loo (\u201cMs. Foo\u201d), a council  \nmember, approved the Installation. The next day , the MA informed the MC about the \napproval for the Installation.  There is some dispute as to whether the Applicant\u2019s \napproval was conditional on the material used being not too noisy when it rains.  This is \nan issue that this Board will be examining in some detail below .Rosalina Soh Pei Xi   STB No. 123 of 2018 (Suites @  Newton)  \nv Hui Mun Wai  and Another    \nPage 4 of 15 \n  \n6. Thereafter, the 1st Respondent proceeded with  the Installation on 26 October 2017.  \n \n7. Subsequently, a t an extraordinary general meeting held on 20 October 2018, a by -law \nallowing for fixed awning s was proposed and passed with 76.3%.  This by -law was duly \nlodged  with the Commissioner of Buildings.  \n \nApplicant \u2019s Case  \n \n8. The Applicant \u2019s main objection is that that the fixed awnings  caused the Applicant  much \ndistress, in particular,  due to  the noise caused by falling raindro ps on the fixed awning .  \nIn this regard, the Applicant called Dr . Tan Kok Yang  (\u201cDr. Tan \u201d), a Principal Acoustic \nConsultant as her  expert witness .  As set out in the Noise Assessment Report produced \nby Dr. Tan  dated 25 January 2019 at paragraphs 5.1 (ii) and (iv):  \n  \n\u201c(ii) \u2026in the event of rain, the roofing panels outside the windows of the bedroom had \nadverse aural effect on the Client/or occupants of the bedroom as the noise level difference \nrecorded was between 4.1 to 8 dB(A) indicating that there was clear and significant  \nchanges in noise levels in the room.  \n \n\u201c(iv) The resulting increases in the noise during in the event of rain, and as a result of \nimpact action of the noise drop on the roofing are likely to cause distress and discomfort \nto the affected person in the bedro om.  Such impact noise may affect sleep and aural and \nmental discomfort for most people with normal hearing. \u201d1 \n \n9. The Applicant gave evidence  that the noise  caused her to lose sleep . On one occasion, \nshe missed a flight for a work trip due to her inability to sleep which caused her to be \nreprimanded badly at work.   All these contributed to her being diagnosed with depression.   \n \n10. The Applicant raised additional issues with the Installation as summarised : \n \n(a) the fixed awning  is outside her bathroom and bedroom windows  which \ncompromised her safety ; \n \n(b) dirt on the  fixed awning  attracted pests  and her bathroom and bedroom windows \nwere thus kept closed ; \n \n(c) water puddles on the fixed awning  might become mosquito breeding sites; and  \n \n                                                           \n1 Affidavit of Evidence in Chief of Tan Kok Yang dated 28 January 2019 at page 21.  Rosalina Soh Pei Xi   STB No. 123 of 2018 (Suites @  Newton)  \nv Hui Mun Wai  and Another    \nPage 5 of 15 \n (d) the fixed awning  did not comply w ith URA  regulations and the Singapore Civil \nDefence ( \u201cSCDF \u201d) fire code . \n \n1st Respondent \u2019s Case  \n \n11. The 1st Respondent \u2019s case is  that the installation was necessary due to \u201ckiller \u201d litter  and \nthat it had been duly approved by the MC .  He has given evidence that  he found a used \ncondom on 27 November 2016 and large pieces of debris of diameters between 5 to 7 \ncentimetres on his open terrace on 10 and 11 June 2017.  \n \n12. The 1st Respondent \u2019s responses  to the Applicant \u2019s issues on the Installation are \nsummarised:  \n \n(a) the noise from raindrops was not loud as alleged by the Applicant  and the Applicant \ndid not complain about this earlier ; \n \n(b) the Applicant \u2019s contention that her security was compromised is rejected as the \nfixed awning  is 6 meters above the ground floor and not publicly accessible;  \n \n(c) the fixed awning  was reasonably  clean and dry when photos were taken of  the said \nshelter .  The fixed awning  also had an incline  for liquids to drain off; and  \n \n(d) the application for the Installation submitted to the MA  had stated the Installation \nwas compliant with BCA and URA regulations.2 \n \nMCST \u2019s Case  \n \n13. The 1st Respondent, who is also Chairman of the MC, argued that approval from URA \nand BCA  was not required  for the Installation .3   His argument was supported by M s. Foo4 \nand the Previous  MA.5  The current MA, M/s Newman & Goh Property Consultants Pte . \nLtd. (\u201cthe Current MA \u201d), is of the view that the fixed awning  was indeed approved by \nthe authorities.6 \n \nThe Law on the Installation of Awnings  in Strata Developments  \n \n14. There are  several issues in relation to the installation of awnings :  \n                                                           \n2 Affidavit of Evidence in Chief of Hui Mun  Wai dated 28 January 2019 at para 18.  \n3 Reply Affidavit of Hui Mun  Wai dated 17 April 2019 at paras 3 to 6.  \n4 Reply Affidavit of Foo Kit Loo dated 16 April 2019 at para 3.  \n5 Reply Affidavit of Chen WenXu dated 17 April 2019 at para 4.  \n6 Reply Affidavit of Lim -Wong Pei Hwa dated 16 April 2019 at para 5.  Rosalina Soh Pei Xi   STB No. 123 of 2018 (Suites @  Newton)  \nv Hui Mun Wai  and Another    \nPage 6 of 15 \n  \n(a) whether a special resolution or 90% resolution  is required  to enact the necessary \nby-law allowing for the installation of  awnings;  \n \n(b) if the requisite  resolution is not obtained, whether there is an exception within the \nstatutory scheme which obliges the management corporation to prescribe \nguidelines for the installation of awnings ; and  \n \n(c) if such a statutory exception  exists, whether the management corporation \u2019s \nobligation to prescribe the awnings is qualified  by the principle that the \nmanagement corporation should only prescribe what is necessary, reasonable, and \nproportionate . \n \n15. To begin, it is important to understand the framework of by -laws within the statutory \nscheme.  T here are two forms of by -laws envisaged in the legislative scheme.  First, there \nare by -laws which may be made by the  management corporation with the prescribed res-\nolution.  This may be termed by -laws of the management corporation.  Second, there are \nby-laws found in the statute (\u201cstatutory by -laws \u201d) which cannot be amended by the man-\nagement corporation .  It is important to note that no by -laws made by the management \ncorporation may conflict with the se statutory by -laws.  \n    \n16. In relation to by -laws which are made by the management corporation, s ection 32(3) of \nthe Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act (Cap 30C , Rev Ed 2008 ) \n(\u201cBMSMA \u201d) provides that:  \n \n\u201c \u2026(3) Save where otherwise provided in section  33, a management corporation may, \npursuant to a special resolution, make by -laws, or amend, add to or repeal any by -laws \nmade under this section, for the purpose of controlling and managing the use or enjoyment \nof the parcel comprised in the strata title plan, including all or any of the following pur-\nposes:  \n \n(a) safety and security measures;  \n(b) details of any common property of which the use is restricted ; \n(c) the keeping of pets;  \n(d) parking;  \n(e) floor covering s; \n(f) garbage disposal;  \n(g) behaviour;  \n(h) architectural and landscaping guidelines to be observed by all subsidiary pro-\nprietors;  \n(i) such other matters as are appropriate to the type of strata scheme concerned. \u201d Rosalina Soh Pei Xi   STB No. 123 of 2018 (Suites @  Newton)  \nv Hui Mun Wai  and Another    \nPage 7 of 15 \n  \n17. Therefore, for these matters a special resolution i.e. a 75% resolution must be obtained  to \nenact the necessary by -laws. \n \n18. However, by -laws which grant subsidiary proprietors exclusive use of common property \nexceeding three years require a higher threshold.  Section 33(1)(c) of the BMSMA stipu-\nlates that a 90% resolution is required to make by -laws conferring on subsidiary prop rie-\ntors the exclusive use and enjoyment of or special privileges in respect of the whole or \nany part of common property exceeding three years.  \n \nA. Whether a Special Resolution or 90% Resolution is Required  \n \n19. In order to address the first issue listed at paragraph 14 (a) above , the question  of whether  \nthe fixing  of an awning on  to the external walls constitute s an exclusive use of common \nproperty exceeding three year s would have to first be answered.   If the answer to this \nquestion is yes, then section 33(1 )(c) of the BMSMA would be engaged and a 90% reso-\nlution  is required  to enact the necessary by -law.  In contrast, i f the answer to this question \nis in the negative, then  only a special resolution of 75% is required.  \n \n20. The answer to this question was recently provided by Justice Chan Seng Onn in Wu Chiu \nLin v Management Corporation Strata Title Plan [2018] 4 SLR 975  (\u201cThe Sunglade \u201d).  \nJustice Chan held that common property included external walls of a strata development \nand hence , a by-law allowing a  subsidiary proprietor who wished to install coverings over \nroof trellises need ed to be passed by a 90% resolution. This is because the installation of \ncoverings over the roof trellises involved the conferring of exclusive use and enjoyment \nof or special privileges exceeding three years in respect of common property.   In Ahmad \nbin Ibr ahim and 21 others v The MCST Plan No. 4131  STB No. 119 of 2017  (\u201cThe Be-\nlysa\u201d) at [26], the Board said:  \n \n\u201c\u2026The Board regards itself to be bound by The Sunglade  decision. Since the coverings \nover the roof trellises are very similar to the installation of awnings, we are of the view \nthat a 90% resolution is required to make the necessary by -laws authorising the awnings. \u201d \n \n21. Thus, a 90 % resolution is required to mak e the necessary by -laws authorising an awning  \nbecause it is fixed to the external wall which is common property .  This will constitute an \nexclusive use of common property.   This point of law is not disputed by the Respondent s.  \nIn the Respondents \u2019 Closing Submissions dated 2nd July 2019, the Respondents submitted  \nat [8]:  Rosalina Soh Pei Xi   STB No. 123 of 2018 (Suites @  Newton)  \nv Hui Mun Wai  and Another    \nPage 8 of 15 \n  \n\u201c\u2026the installation of the awning constitutes exclusive use and enjoyment of the common \nproperty which would ordinarily  require approval by way of an exclusive use by -law \npassed by a 90 % resolution. \u201d \n \nB. Whether an Exception Exists for the Management Corporation to Prescribe Guidelines for \nAwnings installation  \n \n22. However, even if the necessary 90% resolution is not obtained, an exception exists within \nthe statutory by -laws.  In particular, the Second Schedule to  the Building Maintenance \n(Strata Management) Regulations 2005 (\u201cBMSMR 2005 \u201d) contains these statutory by -\nlaws. Paragraph 5(1) of the Second Schedule provides that:  \n \n\u201c5.\u2014(1) A subsidiary proprietor or an occupier of a lot shall not mark, paint, drive nails \nor screws or the like into, or otherwise damage or deface, any structure that forms part of \nthe common property except with the prior written approval of the management \ncorporation. \u201d \n23. Yet, p aragraph  5(1) of the Second Schedule of th e BMSMR 2005  is qualified by paragraph \n5(3) (\u201cby-law 5(3) \u201d) which provides:  \n \n\u201c(3) This by -law shall not prevent a subsidiary proprietor or an occupier of a lot, or a \nperson authorised by such subsidiary proprietor or occupier from installing  \u2014 \n \n(a) any locking or other  safety device for protection of the subsidiary proprietor \u2019s \nor occupier \u2019s lot against intruders or to improve safety within that lot ; \n(b) any screen or other device to prevent entry of animals or insects on the lot ; \n(c) any structure or device  to prevent harm to children ; or \n(d) any device used to affix decorative items to the internal surfaces of walls in the \nsubsidiary proprietor\u2019s or occupier\u2019s lot.\u201d  \n \n \n24. Chief Justice Sundaresh  Menon in Sit Kwong Lam v  Management Corporation Strata \nTitle Plan No 2645 [2018] 1 SLR 790  (\u201cThe Ardmore Park \u201d) at [72] interpreted paragraph \n5(3)(c) of the Second Schedule of the BMSMR 2005 in the following manner:  \n \n\u201c\u2026Reading the exception  in by -law 5(3)( c) in a consistent way, we were of the view that \nit must similarly be limited to the situation where a subsidiary proprietor erected a structure \nor device on common property in order to prevent harm to children while they were within \nhis lot . (emphasis in t he original) \u201d \n Rosalina Soh Pei Xi   STB No. 123 of 2018 (Suites @  Newton)  \nv Hui Mun Wai  and Another    \nPage 9 of 15 \n 25. In The Belysa  at [20], the Board held that by -law 5(3) constituted an exception to the \ngeneral rule that a 90 % resolution was required  when there is a \u201ckiller \u201d litter problem . \nThe Board further held that by -law 5(3) was  wide enough to include an awning which is \n\u201cinstalled to prevent \u201ckiller \u201d litter from harming occupants of the subsidiary proprietor \u2019s \nlot\u201d.   Flowing from inter alia The Ardmore Park , the Board in Pang Loon Ong and Ors \nv The MCST Plan No 4288 STB No. 21 o f 2019 (\u201cD\u2019Leedon \u201d) recently  stated that under \nexisting law the management c orporation did have  the power, and was indeed obligated, \nto prescribe guidelines in relation to awnings when there is a \u201ckiller \u201d litter problem .  In \nD\u2019Leedon , the Board stated that even if the requisite majority is not obtained, the man-\nagement corporation is empowered to issue guidelines in relation to awnings where there \nis a \u201ckiller \u201d litter problem because it \u201ccannot be Parliament \u2019s intention for a management \ncorporation to be imp otent in the face of such a pressing problem faced by its residents .\u201d \n \n26. It should be noted that in both The Belysa and D\u2019Leedon , it was the management corpo-\nration s which insisted  on the subsidiary proprietors installing a retractable awning instead \nof a fixed awning.   Therefore, i t was in that context that  the Board  agreed with the man-\nagement corporations and held  that retractable awnings represent ed a necessary , reasona-\nble and pr oportionate response to the \u201ckiller \u201d litter problem.  Both these decisions did not \ndeal with a situation where the management corporation had allowed for fixed awnings \nand the subsidiary proprietors had relied on the management corporation \u2019s representation .   \n \n27. To summarise, th is is the  position in relation to the  law on  the installation  of awnings  in \na strata development : \n \n(a) Ordinarily, a 90% resolution is required to enact a by -law in relation to the \ninstallation of a n awning which is affixed to common property .  If the requisite \nresolution is obtained, then the subsidiary proprietor is entitled to install the awning \nas per the terms of the resolution ; \n \n(b) However, if there is a \u201ckiller\u201d litter problem, then the management  corporation is \nempowered, and indeed obligated, to stipulate for  guidelines in respect of  the \ninstallation of awnings pursuant to paragraph 5(3) of the BMSMR 2005; and  \n \n(c) In light of an insistence by the management corporation on the installation of \nretract able awnings, the Board has held that the management corporation \u2019s position \nis justified because it was  a necessary,  reasonable  and proportionate response to the \n\u201ckiller \u201d litter problem.   \n \n \n  Rosalina Soh Pei Xi   STB No. 123 of 2018 (Suites @  Newton)  \nv Hui Mun Wai  and Another    \nPage 10 of 15 \n Application of the Law to the Facts  \n \n28. At the hearing, the Applicant and the 1st Respondent sought to downplay each other \u2019s \nconcerns in relation to the fixed awning. This Board is sympathetic to both the Applicant \u2019s \nand 1st Respondent \u2019s predicament s.  While we recognise the Applicant \u2019s sensitivity \ntowards the nois e caused by the fixed awning, this Board also acknowledges the 1st \nRespondent \u2019s desire to have a fixed awning to protect him from \u201ckiller \u201d litter.  \n \n29. The Applicant \u2019s and 1st Respondent \u2019s diametrically opposing position shows that this \ndispute may not be resolved by considering which party suffers the most \u201charm \u201d.  In his \nseminal article \u201cThe Problem of Social Cost \u201d (1960) Journal of Law of Economics 1 , \nRonald Coase pointed ou t the difficulty in using the concept of \"harm\" in property \ndisputes.  Coase explains the reciprocal nature of the problem in using the concept of \n\"harm\"  by arguing that:  \n \n\u201cThe traditional approach has tended to obscure the nature of the choice that has to  be \nmade.  The question is commonly thought of as one in which A inflicts harm on B and what \nhas to be decided is: how should we restrain A?  But this is wrong.  We are dealing with a \nproblem of a reciprocal nature.  To avoid the harm to B would inflict ha rm on A.  The real \nquestion that has to be decided is: should A be allowed to harm B or should B be allowed \nharm A?  The problem is to avoid the more serious harm .\u201d7 \n \n30. Similarly , in this dispute we need to confront the competing nature of the Applicant \u2019s and \nthe 1st Respondent \u2019s claims .  \n \n31. In coming to a decision, this Board considers the first principles in relation to strata living.  \nCathy Sherry, explains succinctly in her monograph, Strata Title Property Rights[ :] \nPrivate Governance of Multi -Owned Prope rties (Routledge, 2017) at 48  on how strata \ndevelopments are governed : \n \n\u201c...internally, strata and community schemes have a democratic structure and ideally \noperate as mini -democracies.  All owners are automatically members of a governing \nbody, generally exercising equal votes.  Owners can elect an executive that exercises \nfunctions on their behalf.  The larger body corporate operates as a mini -legislature \nwith a power to write and amend the laws that govern the scheme.  Arguably, strata \nschemes are a micro -example of the Hobbesian social contract: to be governed by the \n                                                           \n7 R H Coase,  \u201cThe Problem of Social Cost \u201d in The Journal of Law & Economics  (1960 ) V ol 3 at p 2 \n Rosalina Soh Pei Xi   STB No. 123 of 2018 (Suites @  Newton)  \nv Hui Mun Wai  and Another    \nPage 11 of 15 \n rules of  their community, thus making their micro -community a better place for \neveryone to live. \u201d  \n  \n32. Thus, to resolve this dispute we must inquire  into the following questions :  \n \n(a) whether the requisite majority votes was obtained to allow for the fixed awning ; \n \n(b) if the requisite majority was  not obtained, did  the MC,  as the executive for the 2nd \nRespondent,  have the power to allow for the fixed awnings; and  \n \n(c) if such a power exists, whether the MC may only allow for a solution which is \nnecessary, reasonable and proportionate to the \u201ckiller \u201d litter problem . \n \n33. Hence,  the salient issues are: \n \n(a) Was a 90 % resolution obtained in this case allowing for the installation of a fixed \nawning?  If the requisite resolution was obtained, then 1st Respondent  is entitled to \ninstall the awning . \n \n(b) If the 90 % resolution was not obtained, is there a \u201ckiller \u201d litter problem which \nentitled the 2nd Respondent through the MC to stipulate for the installation of \nawnings pursuant to paragraph 5(3) of the BMSMR 2005? and  \n \n(c) If the MC had the power to approve the awning, is  the MC  obligated to  only allow \nfor awnings which are a  necessary,  reasonable  and proportionate response to the \n\u201ckiller \u201d litter problem?   \n \nA. Was a 90 % resolution obtained?  \n \n34. In this case , all the parties were mistaken  as to the requisite majority required to enact the \nrelevant by-law. It appears that parties thought that only a special resolution was required.8  \nThe purported by -law was passed with a 76.3 % majority.9   Since the by -law is not \nsupported by a 90 % majority, the by -law is invalid. Indeed, Justice Chan Seng Onn in \nThe Sunglade  held that a trellis by -law which received 83.06% support at the Annual \nGeneral Meeting was not validly  made.   Thus, the source of t he 1st Respondent \u2019s right to \ninstall the fixed awning cannot be premised on this purported by -law.  \n \n                                                           \n8 Affidavit of Evidence in Chief of Hui Mun  Wai dated 28 January 2019 at pages 191 \u2013 198. \n9 Ibid at page 198. Rosalina Soh Pei Xi   STB No. 123 of 2018 (Suites @  Newton)  \nv Hui Mun Wai  and Another    \nPage 12 of 15 \n B. Is there a \u201cKiller \u201d Litter Problem  Which Justifies the MC to Allow for Awnings ? \n \n35. This Board is satisfied that the Respondents have shown that there is a  \u201ckiller \u201d litter \nproblem. The 1st Respondent has said that concrete debris  had fallen into his private \nenclosed space .  This is evidenced by the email dated 12  June 2017 sent from the 1st \nRespondent to the Previous MA which read:  \n \n\u201cAttached please find photos of large debris found on my sun terrace.  Besides the obvious \nlittering implication by the units located above mine, I am now also very concerned about \nmy personal safety when I step onto my own sun terrace as I could be badly injured by \nfalling deb ris of this sizes (sic).  In my opinion this is now enough reason \u2026to approve the \ninstallation of an awning on my sun terrace \u2026\u201d \n \n36. While the 1st Respondent did not produc e photographic evidence  of the attachment to the \nemail dated 12 June 2017 , the Board also note another subsidiary proprietor had \nmentioned in an extraordinary general meeting held on 20 October 2018 that he also faced \na \u201ckiller \u201d litter problem.10 The Board has no reason to disbelieve the 1st Respondent.  \n \nC. Did the MC Approve the  Fixed Awning?  \n \n37. The present case is slightly different from The Belysa and D\u2019Leedon . In both those cases, \nthe management corporation insisted on the installation of retractable awnings instead of \nfixed awnings . Furthermore, i t was made clear to the subsidiary proprietors  in The Belysa \nfrom the start that the fixed awnings were installed at their own risk and would be subject \nto the annual general meeting. In D\u2019Leedon , the applicants had not installed any awnings \nand were asking for the management cor poration to prescribe guidelines in relation to the \nawnings. The Applicants in D\u2019Leedon asked the Board to order the management corpora-\ntion to prescribe fixed awnings whereas the management corporation was in favour of \nprescribing retractable awnings.   \n \n38. Hence, both th ose cases are  very different from the present situation. In the present case, \nthe fixed awning w as installed pursuant to approval by the  MC of which the Applicant \nwas a member at the material time  and she had voted in favour of the installation of the \nfixed awning . The relevant emails showing the approval are set out below .  On 5 October \n2017, the Previous MA  wrote to the MC members at 10.03 am saying:  \n \n\u201cDear Council members,  \n \n                                                           \n10 Ibid at page  197. Rosalina Soh Pei Xi  STB No. 123 of 2018 (Suites @  Newton)  \nv Hui Mun Wai  and Another  \nPage 13 of 15 Kindly be advised that with regards to the proposed roofing works to be installed at \n#XXX, the plan drawings and a photo reference of the proposed works are attached .\u201d \n39. The 1st Respondent writing as the MC Chairman replied at 2.46 pm saying:\n\u201cApproved from my point of view,  thanks and have a nice day. \u201d \n40. The Applicant, as the MC Treasurer , wrote back as follows  at 3.31 pm \uff1a\n\u201cDear all, \nLuis [the 1st Respondent] should be abstained from approval. hahaha\u2026 \nI am ok with the roofing for #XXX as long as it will not be noisy when it rains. \nIf no assurance can be given, please consider alternative material.  \nThank you. \nBest\uff0c \nRose \u201d \n41. Ms. Foo, a MC member , responded  on the same day at 5.47 pm  as follows\uff1a\n\u201cGreetings! All  \nI am alright with the above roofing..Like Rosalina..The  material used, must not cause too \nmuch noise, when it rains .\u201d \n42. In response, Sarah Teo from the Previous MA  wrote to the three MC members the follow-\ning day at October 6, 2017 as follows:\n\u201cDear Council members, \nThank you for the response, based on the majority approval, the installation of the \nproposed roofing works at # XXX can be carried out.  \nKindly be advised that to ensure congruence of the exterior fa\u00e7ade of the estate, the roof of \nthe same design, will have to be proposed to be constructed outside the units of the 2nd floor.  \nThis item may have to be tabled for the next AGM. Thank you. \u201d  \n43. Shortly thereafter, the 1st Respondent installed the fixed awning. The Applicant disputes\nthe characterisation that the MC members gave the 1st Respondent  approval to install the\nfixed awning.  She point ed out that she  wrote \u201cok with the roofing \u2026as long as it will notRosalina Soh Pei Xi  STB No. 123 of 2018 (Suites @  Newton)  \nv Hui Mun Wai  and Another  \nPage 14 of 15 be noisy when it rains. \u201d This point was also mentioned by Ms. Foo who said that the \n\u201cmaterial used, must not cause too much noise, when it ra ins\u2026\u201d However, the Applicant \u2019s \ncontention that the MC\u2019s approval was merely condition al is rebutted by Ms . Foo\u2019s evi-\ndence. In her testimony, Ms . Foo said that to her mind she had approved the fixed awning \nand her observation about the noise was just a friendly remark. Th erefore , this Board finds \nthat the MC had approved the installation of the fixed awning on 5 October 2017.   \n44. To recapitulate, th is Board has found that there was a killer litter problem and the MC  had\napproved the installation of the fixed awning. As mentioned above, the Board in D\u2019Lee-\ndon found that the management corporation had the power and was indeed under an ob-\nligation to pres cribe guidelines in relation to awnings where there is a \u201ckiller \u201d litter prob-\nlem. Hence, what was done on 5 October 2017 was well within the MC\u2019s power.\n45. The next question is whether this Board should review the MC \u2019s decision which was made\non 5 October 2017. In other words, whether the Board should order the MC  to prescribe\nretractable awnings instead of fixed awnings because the  former  would be a necessary,\nreasonable and proportionate response to the  \u201ckiller \u201d litter  problem .\n46. After careful co nsideration, t his Board is of the view that it  is far too late in the day for\nthe Applicant to seek this order.  An argument for review may possibly be made if  the MC\nhad prescribed  fixed awnings instead of retractable awnings before  a subsidiary proprieto r\nhad acted on  the MC \u2019s prescription.  However, matters assume a different complexion\nwhen a subsidiary proprietor had acted on  the MC \u2019s representation.   There must be some\nfinality to the MC\u2019s everyday decisions.   In other words, the policy of finality of the MC \u2019s\ndecision is overriding  in the present case .\n47. In the present case , the 1st Respondent had already acted on the MC \u2019s approval and in-\nstalled the fixed awning  with the explicit approval of the MC . It is unf air to ask the 1st\nRespondent  to dismantle the fixed awning , which was installed pursuant to MC \u2019s ap-\nproval.  As mentioned above, the facts in the present case differs from those in The Belysa\nand in D\u2019Leedon .\n48. In The Belysa the subsidiary proprietors who installed the fixed awnings did not have the\nmanagement corporation \u2019s approval before they installed the fixed awnings. Th ose sub-\nsidiary proprietors knew that there was always the risk that they would be asked to remove\nthe fixed awnings in future. In contrast, the 1st Respondent had the MC \u2019s explicit approval\nto install the fixed awnings. Similarly, the Board \u2019s observation about retractable awnings\nbeing a necessary , reasonable  and proportionate response to the \u201ckiller \u201d litter problem in\nD\u2019Leedon  was made in the context of a situation where the Applicants have not yet in-\nstalled any awnings.Rosalina Soh Pei Xi  STB No. 123 of 2018 (Suites @  Newton)  \nv Hui Mun Wai  and Another  \nPage 15 of 15 49. Further, the 1st Respondent would have the defence of estoppel against the MCST  for an\norder to remove the awning .  All the classic elements of estoppel i.e. representation,\ndetriment and reliance are present  in the factual scenario .\n50. The Applicant ha s also made allegations that the 1st Respondent \u2019s awning did not comply\nwith URA regulations and the SCDF fire code.  While the Applicant ha s referred to certain\nstatements  and circulars, this Board finds that this allegation has not been sufficiently\nprove n.\n51. In light of the above, t his Board dismisses the application and  will hear the parties on\ncosts.\nDated this  5th day of August  2019  \n______________________________  \nMr Alfonso Ang  \nPresident  \n _______________________________  \nDr Tang Hang Wu  \nMember  \n _______________________________ \nMr Cyril Seah Kwei Hiok  \nMember  \nNarkoorsha A.K. and Teo Sher Min (Narkoosha Law Corporation) \nfor the Applicant.  \nDaniel Chen (Lee & Lee) for the 1st and 2nd Respondents.

The Management shall issue removal notice upon discovery \nincluding serving legal notice .\u201d \n \n5. By way of special resolution, By-Law 4.11.2 was passed.  The same was lodged with the \nBuilding and Construction Authority on 10 July 2018. \n \n6. On 18 January 2019, the Applicants filed this application for the Board to declare By-\nLaw 4.11.2 to be invalid.   Section 106 of the BMSMA provides for the Board to declare \na by-law to be invalid where the SMC does not have the power to make such a by-law.  \n \nISSUES BEFORE THE BOARD \n \n7. The three main issues before the Board are as follows: \n \n(a) Does By-Law 4.11.2 infringe on the Applicants\u2019 property rights in their shops? And \nits corollaries \u2013  \n \n- can the SMC regulate the internal usage of the Applicants\u2019 shops, except Jape Pte. Ltd. & 4 Ors.         STB No. 6 of 2019 (Junction Nine) \nv The Subsidiary Management Corporation No. 1 - \nStrata Title Plan No. 4431 \n \n4 \n where safety is concerned?   \n \n- does By-Law 4.11.2 serve a purpose beyond the prescribed By-Law 18 in the \nBuilding Management and Strata Management Regulations \n2005(\u201cRegulations \u201d)?  \n \n(b) What is the effect of Clause 35 of the Sale & Purchase Agreement (\u201c SPA\u201d)?  \n  \n(c) What is effect of the Consent Order? \n \nAPPLICANTS\u2019 CASE \n \n8. The Applicants\u2019 case is that the issue between the parties was on safety and storage of \nitems in the Applicants\u2019 open concept shop units to not affect the deployment of the \nsmoke curtain and not to encroach on common property. This was evidenced in the letters \nbetween the parties from October 2016 to January 2017 where issues on fire curtain and \nencroachment were raised but no reference was made to renovation, fitting works, and/or \nheight of racks or goods stored in the shop units with open concept.1 \n \n9. The Applicants submitted that the Respondent does not have the power to make By-Law \n4.11.2 because this interfered with the internal usage of their open concept units (for \nwhich the Applicants paid a substantial amount).2 Whereas the owners of open concept \nunits had limits to the height of goods displayed in their shops, the enclosed shop owners \ncould display their goods to almost their units\u2019 ceiling height (up to 3 metres).3  Further, \nthe terms of the SPA stated that the shop units with open concept were to enable \nmaximum visibility and openness and the Applicants maintained that there was a high \nlevel of visibility for their shop units with open concept, including being open to the space \nabove them.4 The Applicants submitted that the Respondent can regulate their shop \nspace, but only where safety was concerned.5 \n \n10. The Applicants also submitted that the Respondent\u2019s arguments that their approval was \nrequired for the installation of racks higher than 1.2 metres and for putting up signboards \nat more than 1.8 metres was an afterthought to justify passing By-Law 4.11.2.6  There \nwere other purchasers/tenants of the shop units with open concept that had installed sign \nboards, structures and fittings that exceeded 1.8 metres in height without the \nRespondent\u2019s approval.  \n \nRESPONDENT\u2019S CASE \n \n11. At the hearing on 20 June 2019, the Respondent submitted that where safety was the \n                                                        \n1 Affidavit of Evidence in Chief of Patrick Saik Seow Ghee dated 2 May 2019 from pages 83 to 93. \n2 Applicants\u2019 written submissions dated 23 May 2019 at paras 17 and 19. \n3 Applicants\u2019 written submissions dated 23 May 2019 at para 32. \n4 Applicants\u2019 written submissions dated 23 May 2019 at paras 14 and 25. \n5 Applicants\u2019 written submissions dated 23 May 2019 at para 30. \n6 Applicants\u2019 written submissions dated 23 May 2019 at para 8.

Further, it was not in \ndispute between the parties that the Applicants could stack goods within their own shop \nunits.   \n \n12. The Respondent\u2019s case is that as far the shop units with open concept were concerned: \n \n\u201c(a) there must be visibility of the interior of the shops; \n(b) there must be openness in that installations within the shops must not be of such \nnature that the installations become \u201cwalls\u201d as it were; and \n(c) of course, the safety of the occupiers and shoppers were of paramount concern.\u201d7 \n \n13. The Respondent submits that besides having high visibility and openness \u2013 these being \nthe purport of the SPA, the owners of shop units with open concept needed to obtain the \nRespondent\u2019s consent for any and all changes to their units.8 \n \nBOARD\u2019S DECISION \n \nBalancing between property rights and safety concerns \n \n14. Section 82(4) of the BMSMA states that Section 32 By-laws for common property, and \nSection 33 Exclusive use by-laws, apply to the by-laws of an SMC as they apply to the \nby-laws of a management corporation.   \n \n15. By-Law 4.11.2 was passed pursuant to Section 32(3) of the BMSMA. Section 32(3) of \nthe BMSMA empowers the SMC to make by-laws which are \u201c for the purpose of \ncontrolling and managing the use or enjoyment of the parcel comprised in the strata title \nplan\u201d. \n \n16. It is stated in By-Laws 4.11 and 4.11.1 that: \n \n\u201c4.11 STORAGE OF MATERIALS AND OBSTRUCTIONS TO COMMON \nPASSAGE, FIRE ESCAPE ETC. \n \n4.11.1 The Owners/Occupiers/Tenants must ensure that their stock, goods or any items \nare kept within their premises as any obstruction to the common corridors fire escape \nroutes etc. shall be immediately cleared away by the Management and all removal \ncost so incurred shall be charged to the Owner/Occupier/Tenant accordingly.  If the \nOccupier/Tenant refused to pay, then the Management shall charge it to the Owners \naccordingly due to non-payment by their Occupier/Tenant. \u201d \n \nThe above applies to all owners and does not differentiate between owners of shop units \nwith open concept and other shop owners.   \n \n17. By-Law 4.11.2 which follows after By-Law 4.11.1 states that: \n                                                        \n7 Affidavit of Evidence in Chief of Vijay Nath Rai dated 3 May 2019 at para 35. \n8 Respondent\u2019s written submissions dated 23 May 2019 at paras 40 and 41. Jape Pte. Ltd. & 4 Ors.         STB No. 6 of 2019 (Junction Nine) \nv The Subsidiary Management Corporation No. 1 - \nStrata Title Plan No. 4431 \n \n6 \n  \n\u201cThe Owners/Occupiers/Tenants of kiosk/open units shall ensure that their stock, \ngoods, signage or any installation must keep within the units and must not stack and \ninstall above 1.8m in height from ground level. Installation of signage shall be \nreviewed on a case-by-case basis subject to the approval of the Management.  The \nManagement shall issue removal notice upon discovery including serving legal \nnotice.\u201d   \n \n18. The Board finds By-Law 4.11.2 to be ambiguous or unclear (the Respondent submitted \nthat its wording is \u201c far from perfect \u201d and invites the Board to \u201c refine the wording of the \nby-law\u201d9).  Based on a plain reading of By-Law 4.11.2, it applies to \u201c kiosk/open units \u201d. \nIt is common ground that there are no kiosks in the development 10 nor \u201copen units \u201d. \nThere are, however , \u201c Shop units with Open Concept \u201d or \u201cOpen Concept Units \u201d.11 For \nthis reason alone, the by-law is questionable. \n \n19. The Board disagrees with the Respondent\u2019s case that their written approval is required \nfor any or all changes to the Applicants\u2019 units.   The law seeks to balance the property \nrights of shop owners as to how they wish to lay-out and/or furnish their lots with the \noverriding concern of safety or where the use of such rights may lead to legitimate \nconcerns from other owners/users; see [20] below. \n \n20. Pursuant to Section 32(3) of the BMSMA, the SMC can pass special resolutions to make \nby-laws for the purpose of controlling and managing the use and enjoyment of the parcel \ncomprised in the strata titles plan which includes the following prescribed purposes: \n \n\u201c(a) safety and security measures; \n(b) details of any common property of which the use is restricted; \n(c) the keeping of pets; \n(d) parking; \n(e) floor coverings; \n(f) garbage disposal; \n(g) behavior; \n(h) architectural and landscaping guidelines to be observed by all subsidiary \nproprietors;  \n(i) such other matters as are appropriate to the type of strata scheme concerned .\u201d \n \nIn our view, the SMC cannot make a by-law that interferes with the height limit at which \nthe shop owners could display the goods in their own shops, if this is not for any of the \nprescribed purposes as stated above.  This is consistent with the position that an SMC \ncannot make a by-law where it has no powers to do so under Section 106 of the BMSMA. \n   \n                                                        \n9 Respondent\u2019s written submissions dated 23 May 2019 at para 83. \n10 Applicant\u2019s written submissions dated 23 May 2019 at para 34. \n11 Affidavit of Evidence in Chief of Patrick Saik Seow Ghee dated 2 May 2019 at page 66 with reference to Clause \n35 of the SPA.  Jape Pte. Ltd. & 4 Ors.         STB No. 6 of 2019 (Junction Nine) \nv The Subsidiary Management Corporation No. 1 - \nStrata Title Plan No. 4431 \n \n7 \n 21. In this regard, the Board finds the prescribed purpose the Respondent is relying on for \npassing By-Law 4.11.2 is safety, elaborated below at [23]  \u0336   [30]. While the Respondent \nhad also made submissions on the importance of maintaining visibility of the areas \naround the Applicants\u2019 units as an underlying reason for By-Law 4.11.2, the title of By-\nLaw 4.11, \u201c Storage of Materials and Obstructions to Common Passage, Fire Escape \netc.\u201d suggests otherwise. \n \n22. Further, the Respondent had also conceded at the hearing of 20 June 2019 that while the \nSMC can interfere in every (open concept) unit to regulate the height limit of stacking of \ngoods to no more than 1.8 metres, the SMC cannot do so to the enclosed shop units as it \ndoes not have right to \u201c interfere\u201d.12  In the Board\u2019s view, By-Law 4.11.2 obviously \ndiscriminates between enclosed shop units and open concept shop units without proper \njustification or basis. The By-Law can also be repealed under Section 105 of the BMSMA \non this basis.13  In summary, the Board is of the view that aside from the grounds listed \nin Section 32(3) of the BMSMA, the SMC does not have the power or legal basis to \ninterfere in the internal layout of all shop units. In short, the By-Law cannot sensibly and \nlogically be construed to interfere with the rights of shop owners within their units so that \nthey are prohibited from stacking stock, goods, signage or any installation above 1.8 \nmetres in height from ground level.   \n \nBy-Law 4.11.2 vis-\u00e0-vis prescribed by-law in the Regulations \n \n23. Pursuant to Section 32 of the BMSMA, the by-laws passed by the SMC shall not be \ninconsistent with any such prescribed by-law in the Regulations. \n \n24. Regulation 21 of the Regulations provides as follows: \n \n\u201cBy-laws applicable to limited common property, etc. \n21. Subject to section 82 of the Act, the by-laws prescribed in the Second Schedule \nshall apply to the limited common property managed and maintained by a subsidiary \nmanagement corporation with the following modifications: \n(a) any reference in the by-laws to the management corporation shall be read as a \nreference to the subsidiary management corporation; and \n(b) any reference in the by-laws to the common property shall be read as a reference \nto the limited common property .\u201d \n \n25. The prescribed by-laws in the Second Schedule of the Regulations are applicable in this \ncase. \n \n26. By-Law 18 of the prescribed by-laws in the Second Schedule of the Regulations provide \nas follows: \n \n       \u201cPrevention of fire and other hazards \n                                                        \n12 Transcript of 20th June 2019 Page 63 Line 4-17 and Page 70 Line 1-4. \n13 Roland Yeo Peng Sin/Chan Mei Yoke and 19 Ors. v The MCST Plan No. 2054  STB No. 54 of 2013 (\u201c Parc \nOasis\u201d) at paras 10 and 20.

The Respondent stated that fire hazard contraventions was the issue between the parties \nin the period between late 2016 and mid-2017, resulting in the filing of the 2017 \nApplication and the Respondent produced copies of the notices issued by the SCDF \nthereof. 14  The Respondent also admitted that the other issue at that time was on the \nApplicants\u2019 placement of goods that obstructed passageways and escape routes, which \nhad \u201csince been abated \u201d.15  These issues had been settled in a Consent Order elaborated \nbelow at [38]-[42]. \n \n28. The Respondent produced photographs to show that the Applicants\u2019 shop units with open \nconcept had installations/goods that obstructed the full deployment of the smoke \ncurtains.16  They also claimed that as recent as 11 April 2019,  SCDF had conducted a \nspot check on Junction Nine and found that smoke curtains could not be deployed to full \nlength due to the obstruction by the Applicants\u2019 racks/goods/installations.17  The Board \nfinds it surprising that where SCDF notices were produced for the past fire safety \nbreaches by the Applicants, there was no similar SCDF notice produced for the fire safety \nbreach on 11 April 2019. The Respondent submits that the Applicants had \u201c only recently \nmoved/removed their racks/stock/goods/items that were preventing the full deployment \nof the smoke/fire curtains.  The smoke/fire curtains can now be fully deployed \u201d.18  \n \n29. In view of the evidence before the Board (i.e. that the issue had abated and that the \nRespondent had not provided concrete evidence that the Applicants had breached fire \nsafety regulations), the Board found that the Respondent had not, in this application, \ndischarged its burden to show the Applicants were in breach of safety on a balance of \nprobabilities.19 The Board is further fortified in its views that safety concerns were not \n                                                        \n14 Affidavit of evidence in chief of Vijay Nath Rai dated 3 May 2019 from paras 26 to 28. \n15 Affidavit of evidence in chief of Vijay Nath Rai dated 3 May 2019 at para 29. \n16 Affidavit of evidence in chief of Vijay Nath Rai dated 3 May 2019 at paras 38 and 39. \n17 Affidavit of evidence in chief of Vijay Nath Rai dated 3 May 2019 at para 42. \n18 Respondent\u2019s written submissions dated 12 July 2019 at para 89. \n19 Section 103 of the Evidence Act states as follows:  Jape Pte.

The Respondent also conceded that the minutes of the AGM of 22 \nJune 2018 did not record any discussions, whether as to safety, visibility or openness or \nat all, before the By-Law 4.11.2 was passed.21 \n30.The Board therefore finds that the Respondent does not have the power to make By-Law\n4.11.2 where it is not shown by the Respondent that the making of the said By-Law is for\nthe prescribed purpose, namely safety.\nLegal Effect of Clause 35 of the SPA \n31.In \u201cThe Law of Contract in Singapore\u201d by Andrew Phang (Lexis Nexis 2012) at\nparagraph [06.023], it was stated that where the contract is in writing, the terms of the\ncontract are usually determined by reference to the written document.  In Zurich\nInsurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd v B-Gold Interior Design & Construction Pte Ltd  [2008]\n3 SLR(R) at 1029, it was held by V K Rajah JA (as his Honor then was) that:\n\u201cThe first and foremost consideration in approaching any written contract must be the \nessence and attributes of the document being examined.  Different genres of documents \nmay require different treatment by the court at various stages of the analytical process. \nFor example, for standard form contracts and documents for commercial circulation \n(e.g. negotiable instruments), the presumption that all the terms of the agreement \nbetween the parties are contained in the contract will be almost impossible to rebut. \nSuch documents are examples par excellence of contracts that look complete to \nparties\u2026\u201d  \n32.It is not in dispute between the parties that the SPA for the sale and purchase of Shop\nunits with Open Concept is complete and that it contains all the terms of the agreement\nbetween the seller and the buyer, namely the Applicants.  The express terms of Clause\n35 of the SPA states as follows:\n\u201c35. Shop units with Open Concept \n35.1 The Purchaser acknowledges and accepts the following in respect of the \nnamed Units, which have been approved for use as \u201cshop\u201d, namely #XXX, # XXX, \n#XXX, \n\u201c103(1) Whoever desires any court to give judgment as to any legal right or liability, dependent on the existence \nof facts which he asserts, must prove that those facts exist. \n(2) When a person is bound to prove the existence of any fact, it is said that the burden of proof lies on that\nperson.\u201d\nSection 105 of the Evidence Act states as follows:\n\u201c105. The burden of proof to any particular fact lies on that person who wishes the court to believe in its existence,\nunless it is provided by any law that the proof of that fact shall lie on any particular person .\u201d\n20 Transcript of 20th June 2019 Page 72 Line 15-21.\n21 Transcript of 20th June 2019 Page 116 Line 1-20.Jape Pte.

Installation of Partition, Wall or Doors to the Unit \nThe Purchaser acknowledges and accepts that prior written approval of the \nConsenting Party is required for the installation (or removal) of any partition, wall or \ndoors to the Unit.  In particular, without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, \nthe Purchaser shall seek to ensure a high level of visibility of the interior of the Unit. \u201d \n34.The Board finds that Clause 36 would apply to all shop owners (and in that regard, all\nthe purchasers of the shop units) and not just the shop units with open concept.  In that\nregard, \u201cmaximum visibility \u201d and \u201chigh level of visibility \u201d apply to shop units with open\n22 Affidavit of evidence in chief of Vijay Nath Rai dated 3 May 2019 at paras 20 to 22. \n23 Applicants\u2019 written submissions dated 23 May 2019 at para 22.

The Respondent\u2019s case that there must be \n\u201cvisibility in the interior of the shops\u201d does not apply only to the shop units with open \nconcept but also to the shops with enclosed space. It is not in dispute between the parties \nthat owners of shops with enclosed space face no height restriction with respect to the \nstacking of their stock, goods, signage or any installation. \n35.The Board finds that the issue of visibility in the interior of the shops had arisen pursuant\nto the terms of the SPA and not under the by-laws.  It is not necessary to decide on the\nissue of whether Clause 35 had been breached for the purpose of this application.\n36.For the reasons set out in [14] \u2013 [30] above, By-Law 4.11.2 is invalid and the Board\norders that it be repealed.\n37.The Board now proceeds to elaborate on the Consent Order that was made in the 2017\nApplication.\nLegal Effect of the Consent Order \n38.The law is trite with respect to a Consent Order made between the parties.  In the course\nof litigation, it is a good practice for parties to embody their agreement in a consent\njudgment as apart from giving the settlement official and confirmed status, the consent\njudgment may be automatically enforced in the same way as any other judgment. (See\nChapter 21 Judgments and Orders in \u201c Principles of Civil Procedure \u201d by Jeffrey Pinsler,\nSC (Academy Publishing 2013), at [21.017] and [21.018]).  As stated by Bryne J in\nWilding v Sanderson 24,\n\u201cA consent judgment or order is meant to be the formal result and \nexpression of an agreement already arrived at between the parties to \nproceedings embodied in an order of the court.  The fact of its being so \nexpressed put the parties in a different position from the position of those \nwho have simply entered into an ordinary agreement.\u201d \n39.The Court of Appeal in Woo Koon Chee v Scandinavian Boiler Service (Asia) Pte Ltd\n[2010] 4 SLR 1213 at [24] \u0336  [28] also held that there was no real difference between an\norder and a judgment in substance and in form.  It makes no difference whether the\njudgment or order is obtained arising from a contested hearing or by the consent of the\nparties.  It is automatically enforceable in both instances.\n40.It is also well established that where a court order is intended to substantially give effect\nto the parties\u2019 intentions, it would be relevant to consider these intentions when giving\nconsideration to the express wording of the order. (See [39] of Hoban Steven Maurice\nDixon and anr v Scalon Graeme John and others [2007] 2 SLR(R) 770).\n41.By consent of the parties, the Applicants had agreed to remove all encroachment, comply\nwith the MCST prescribed by-laws, and not store any items exceeding 1.8 metres that\n24 [1897] 2 Ch 534 at 543.

The Board \nnotes that in the 2017 Application, the Respondent had applied, inter alia , for an order \nthat the Applicants were not to stack items above 1.8 metres.  After the successful \nmediation conducted by the Board then, the restriction was agreed by parties to be limited \nto stacking of goods above 1.8 metres \u201c that will obstruct the deployment of the smoke \ncurtain\u201d.  This was enough to suggest that parties must have thought that the Applicants \ncould stack goods exceeding 1.8 metres provided that the stacking did not obstruct the \ndeployment of the smoke curtain.   \n42.The Consent Order made between the parties may be enforced in the same way as any\nother judgment.  Parties are therefore bound by the Consent Order.\n43.The Board will hear the parties on costs.\nDated this 1st day of August 2019 \n _________________________ \n Mr Raymond Lye  \n Deputy President \n _________________________ \n Mr Lai Huen Poh \n Member \n _________________________ \n Ms Chew Yi-Ling Elaine \n Member \nMr Michael Chong (M/s APAC Law Corporation) for the Applicants \nMr Andrew Wu (M/s Allister Lim & Thrumurgan) for the \nRespondent "

The Balmoral is a 31-year-old development located at 20 Balmoral Park, Singapore \n259849. This development comprised 81 residential units of three different unit-types:\n(a)a single 10-storey tower block with 3 penthouses\n(b)two 4-storey blocks of 2-level maisonettes; and\n(c)two blocks of 4 storey townhouses. The townhouses are standalone and adjoined  \nto each other along certain parts of the side walls.\n2. The Applicant is the subsidiary proprietor of a stand-alone 4-storey townhouse unit \nlocated at Block 20 #XXX.\n3. The Respondent is the Management Corporation of the development.\n4. There were leakages of water within the Applicant\u2019s unit at various locations. The \nApplicant took the position that those leakages originated from \u201ccommon property\u201d \nareas and took his case against the Management Corporation to the Small Claims  \nTribunals. The Applicant\u2019s case was ordered to be discontinued by the Registrar of the \nSmall Claims Tribunals on the ground that his case was outside the jurisdiction of the \nTribunals with liberty to appeal to the Referee. The Applicant did not file an appeal but  \nbrought his case to the Strata Titles Board (\u201cSTB\u201d) instead.\nTHE APPLICANT\u2019S CASE  \n5. In his application to the Strata Titles Board, the Applicant sought the following orders ,\nnamely that it is the responsibility of the MCST -1374 The Balmoral to: -\n(a)maintain and repair the roof of the townhouse ;\n(b)make all external walls waterproof ;\n(c)look after and maintain glass awning ;\n(d)reimburse him for repairs done including external ceiling and termit es treatment ;\nand\n(e)reimburse him the total costs of $5000/ - for expenses, travel to and from London\nplus small claims court .Raman Dhir v The MCST Plan No. 1374  STB No. 8 of 2019  (The Balmoral)  \nPage 4 of 8 6. The Applicant testified that the various water leakages into his unit were:\n(a)from the RC flat roof above the property, through the walls and down into the\nstairwell and the parts of the property ;\n(b)from the same RC flat roof above the property, through the walls and under a\nbalcony at the 4th storey ;\n(c)from various fixed window panels in the property which ran fro m the 2nd to the\n4th stories of the property ;\n(d)from the awning  over the entrance of the property ; and\n(e)termite damage to the property as a result of the various leakages .\n7. The Applicant claimed that the RC flat roof, the fixed windows and the awning are\n\u201ccommon proper ties\u201d and the Management Corporation are responsible for their repairs\nand the damages caused by the water leakages originating from these areas.\n8. The Applicant testified that around 2016 and 2017 there were significant water leakages\nin his unit  at various locations. He wrote to the MCST via many e -mails complaining of\nleakages \u201cfrom the lower part of the external walls which is not gravel is just a thin layer\nof cement and that is probably causing the problem\u201d, \u201cfrom lower wall facing the main\nentrance\u2026\u201d, \u201cfrom windows around the four semi -circular steps \u201d, \u201cfrom external\nceiling\u201d, \u201cfrom electrical sockets\u201d and many other places. The MCST was dragging their\nfeet and did not respond to his complaints as there were some disputes over whose\nresponsib ility it was to do the repairs. He had to do repairs as and when necessary using\nhis own contractors. His agent Richard Jany Road Estate Pte Ltd wrote to the MCST\u2026\n\u201cit seems that you expect us to carry out various \u2018witchhunt\u2019 to determine the source of\nthe water penetration\u2026\u201d\n9. The Applicant said that h e did  not engage any expert to investigate and determine the\nsource (s) of these leakages. He submitted various photographs, videos, invoices, and\nquotations for ad -hoc repairs in his unit and concluded that the source (s) of the various\nleakages was/were from the three areas he alleged to be \u201ccommon properties \u201d and the\nMCST are therefore liable.\nTHE RESPONDENT \u2019S CASE  \n10. The R espondent  denied that these three areas , namely  the RC  flat roof, the fixed\nwindows, and the glass awnin g are \u201ccommon properties \u201d.\n11. They als o submitted that there  was no expert report on where the various water leakages\noriginated from. The various photographs, invoices/quotation, videos are not helpful.\nM3 Multi Services Pte Ltd (\u201cM3\u201d) report contained o nly their observation and the\nrecommendation for repairs.  They are not experts but contractors.  The Respondent\ntherefore, submitted that the  Applicant had failed to make out his case against MCST\nfor the damages claimed.Raman Dhir v The MCST Plan No. 1374  STB No. 8 of 2019  (The Balmoral)  \nPage 5 of 8 12. The R espondent \u2019s witness Kalachelvam  (R1) the site manager testified that during a\njoint inspection with the Applicant\u2019s representative Mr Chin, he did not notice any water\nleakages on the ceiling of the RC  flat roof, but there was water ponding on the RC  flat\nroof then.\nISSUES TO BE DETERMINED  \n13. The issues before the Board a re:\n(1)whether these 3 areas are common properties under the B uilding Maintenance and\nStrata Management Act Cap. 30C (\u201cthe Act\u201d). i.e.\n(a)the RC flat roof ;\n(b)the fixed window panels ; and\n(c)the cu rved aluminium awning with poly carbonate cover (T he A wning) .\n(2)whether the source (s) of the various water leakages in the Applicant\u2019s unit that\ncaused the alleged damages to the Applicant\u2019s property originated from the 3 areas .\n14. Common property under the Act p rior to the amendment in 2017 is  defined as follows\nin Section 2(1):\n\u201cCommon P roperty\u201d, subject to subsection 9 means \u2013\n(1)in relation to any land and building comprised or to be comprised in a strata title\nplan, such part of the land and building \u2014\n(a)not comprised in any lot or proposed lot in that strata title plan; and\n(b)used or capable of being used or enjoyed by occupiers of 2 or more lots or\nproposed lots;\n(2)in relation to any other land and building, such part of the land and building \u2014\n(a)not comprised in any non -strata lot; and\n(b)used or capable of being used or enjoyed by  occupiers of 2 or more non  strata\nlots within  that land or building; or\n15. Section 2(9)  of the Act  states as follows: -\n\u201c(9) For the purposes of this Act \u2014\n(a)all windows of a lot, proposed lot or non -strata lot that are  located on any\nexterior wall of the lot, proposed lot or (as the case may be) non -strata lot,\nbeing either louvres, casement windows, sliding windows or windows with\nany movable part, shall be part of the lot, proposed lot or (as the case may\nbe) non -strata lot and not c ommon property; andRaman Dhir v The MCST Plan No. 1374  STB No. 8 of 2019  (The Balmoral)  \nPage 6 of 8 (b)all other windows of a lot, proposed lot or non -strata lot that are locat ed on\nany exterior wall of the lot, proposed lot or (as the case may be) non -strata\nlot shall be common property, unless otherwise described in a strata title\nplan\u201d.\nAre the 3 structures common properties?  \nThe RC Flat Roof  \n16. The whole of the 4th storey of the Applicant\u2019s unit is, in fact an open flat roof deck with\nbalconies and flower boxes and is delineated in black lines in the strata title plan. (black\nlines indicate the strata boundary of the 4th storey ).\n17. The 4th storey is the roof  of the entire unit of the townhouse. It is part of the total strata\narea of the unit. R4 had confirmed this.\n18. The only a ccess to the 4th storey from the 3rd storey is via an internal private staircase.\nThe area around this staircase landing is enclosed and covered by the small RC flat roof\nwith a usable space on it. This is the RC  flat roof in issue. This RC  flat roof is delineated\nin red  in the strata title plan and the  usable area is not part of the total strata area of the\nunit.\n19. According to witness Low Lee Luang ( \u201cR4\u201d) a practising registered surveyor , black\nlines indicates strata boundaries and red lines denot e building and other details.\n20. According to R 4, the enclosed red area covered by the RC  flat roof is within the 4th\nstorey strata boundary .\n21. The usable space on the RC  flat roof is currently being used by the Applicant to install\nhis air conditioner condensers and some electrical boxes and cables for his exclusive\nuse.\nThe Awning  \n22. R4 testified that this aw ning was drawn as outside the strata boundary of the 3rd storey\nin the strata title plan. She clarified that she had  personally inspected the site and saw\nthat this awning did not reach anywhere near the 3rd storey. She confirmed that t his\nawning is physically within the strata boundary of the 1st storey and se rves also  as a\ncover for the main entrance concrete structure of the 1st storey.\nThe Windows  \n23. It is not disputed that the glass panels in the lot are windows with no movable parts.\n24. The photographs of the unit tendered showed quite clearly that these wind ows are\nlocated on some exterior walls of the lot .Raman Dhir v The MCST Plan No. 1374  STB No. 8 of 2019  (The Balmoral)  \nPage 7 of 8 THE  BOARD\u2019S VIEW  \nThe RC Flat Roof  \n25. The ordinary meaning of roof is, \u201cthe structure that covers or forms the top of a building \u201d\naccording to the Oxford Advanced Learning Dictionary. The roof of the Applicant\u2019s unit\nis in fact the whole of the 4th storey as it forms the top and covers the whole of the\ntownhouse unit.\n26. The \u201cRC flat roof\u201d is not a roof. It is only a feature within the strata boundary of the 4th\nstorey and covers the small enclosed area beneath it . It serves only the Applicant\u2019s\ntownhouse unit and no other unit. It is for his exclusive use. The usable area on it is used\nby the Applicant for installing items for his exclusive use only. It is accessible only from\nthe 3rd storey within the Applicant\u2019s unit.\n27. Although it was delineated in red lines and not black lines, the Board notes that other\nfeatures such as balconies, flower boxes, private internal staircases, wash areas and\nothers within the unit were also similarly delineated in red lines.\n28. The Board is of the view that the \u201cRC flat roof\u201d is not a roof. It is, together with the\nstaircase , a main feature of the unit and is compr ised in the Applicant\u2019s lot in the strata\ntitle plan . The RC  flat roof feature  is for his own exclusive use. It is not common\nproperty .\nThe Awning  \n29. The Board accepts R4\u2019s evidence that this feature sits within the strata boundary of the\n1st storey of the Applicant\u2019s unit. It is situated between the 1st level and the 2nd level.  It\nis not a roof nor a window. It is simply a fixed feature that  extends from within the  unit\nand covers the main entrance  of the 1st storey.\n30. It serves only the Applicant\u2019s unit and no other unit. It is for his exclusive use. The Board\nfinds this feature is also comprised in the Applicant\u2019s lot in the strata title plan. It is not\ncommon property.\nThe Windows  \n31. From the photographs and the strata title plan tendered, it is clear that the windows are\nlocated on the exterior walls of the lot.  The Board is of the view that the fixed windows\ncome within the definition of all other windows in subsection 9 of section 2 of the Act.\nThey are common properties.\nTermites \n32. There is no evidence adduced to show termite damage to the Applicant\u2019s property except\na quotation for treatment.Raman Dhir v The MCST Plan No. 1374  STB No. 8 of 2019  (The Balmoral)  \nPage 8 of 8 THE BOARD\u2019S FINDING  \n33. Without the benefit of an expert\u2019s report on tracing where the various leakages\noriginated from, the Board is unable to make a finding on the evidence adduced that the\nvarious leakages in the App licant\u2019s unit originated from the three areas i.e.\n(a)the RC flat roof;\n(b)The A wning; and\n(c)the fixed windows.\n34. The Board f inds that the RC flat roof and T he A wning are not common properties as the\n1st limb of S2(1) BMSMA  of the definition is not satisfied and the two features are for\nthe exclusive use of the Applicant and serves only his unit.\n35. The Board finds the fixed window panels are common properties under S2(9) of the Act.\nTHE BOARD\u2019S ORDER  \n36. The Applicant\u2019s claims for damage s and disbursements are dismissed.\n37. The responsibility to maintain the fixed windows and keep them in good repair lies with\nthe MCST as in all other common properties.\n38. Costs to the Respondent fixed at $18 ,000 including  disbursements .\nDated this 31st day of  July 2019  \n________________________  \nMR SENG KWANG BOON  \nDeputy President  \n________________________  \nMR KONG MUN KWONG  \nMember  \n________________________  \nMR TONY TAY CHYE TECK  \nMember  \nMr Daniel Chen (Lee & Lee) for the Applicant.  \nMs Hui Choon Wai  (Wee Swee Teow LLP) for the Respondent.

The Applicants are the subsidiary proprietors of tw o (2) ground floor units comprising \nlarge private enclosed spaces with a curved shape a s part of their strata area. The \nRespondent is the Management Corporation Strata Tit le Plan No. 4288 (\u201cManagement \nCorporation\u201d) comprising the subsidiary proprietors  of a development known as \nD\u2019Leedon. The Management Corporation was constitute d on 14 September 2015. The \ndeveloper of D\u2019Leedon is Morganite Pte Ltd (\u201cDevelo per\u201d) and its managing agent is \nSavills Property Management Pte Ltd (\u201cSavills\u201d).   \n \nTHE APPLICANTS\u2019 CASE \n \n2.  It is undisputed that the Applicants and other grou nd floor units faced numerous incidences \nof \u201ckiller\u201d litter falling from the upper floors in to their private enclosed spaces. The term \n\u201ckiller\u201d litter in this context means objects throw n or falling from high buildings which \nendangered the people below . Savills recorded 55 reported cases of \u201ckiller\u201d lit ter in 2017 \nand another 57 in 2018. Several police reports were  made in relation to some of these \n\u201ckiller\u201d litter incidents. The Applicants have youn g children aged between three (3) months \nto eight (8) years old.  \n \n3.  Prior to this action, the Applicants wrote to Savil ls in relation to the \u201ckiller\u201d litter problem \nrequesting permission to install awnings to protect  themselves. Permission was denied by \nthe Respondent on the ground that they are not empo wered to approve any installations to \nsafeguard against \u201ckiller\u201d litter. The Respondent t ook the position that this is a matter solely \nwithin the province of the Annual General Meeting. While several attempts were made to \npass the necessary resolutions to approve by-laws a llowing awnings (fixed or retractable) \nbefore the Annual General Meeting, it was undispute d that the requisite number of votes \nwere not obtained.  \n \n4.  In this application, the Applicants sought the foll owing orders: \n \n(a)  that the Respondent consents to the Applicants\u2019 ins tallation of fixed coverings at their \nprivate enclosed spaces in accordance with the desi gn guidelines and specifications \nset by the Developer, or such design which the Boar d deems to be a reasonable and \nproportionate response to the killer litter problem  faced by the Applicants; and \n \n(b)  that the Respondent pays the Applicants costs for t his application. \n \n5.  After the present application was filed on 21 Febru ary 2019 but before the arbitration \nhearing on 7 May 2019, the Respondent proceeded to issue guidelines for the installation Pang Loon Ong and Others   STB No. 21 of 2019 (D\u2019Le edon) \nv The MCST Plan No. 4288                                                                                              \n \nPage 4 of 11  \n of a retractable awning design on 17 April 2019. Th ese guidelines were issued just before \nthe deadline for exchange of affidavits of evidence -in-chief.  \n \nTHE RESPONDENT\u2019S CASE \n \n6.  The Respondent\u2019s position was simply that it was no t able or empowered to approve the \nawnings when the necessary votes for the by-law on fixed or retractable awnings were not \nobtained at the Annual General Meeting. However, th e Respondent issued guidelines for \nretractable awnings on 17 April 2019. \n \nTHE BOARD\u2019S VIEW \n \n7.  In the Board\u2019s view, the Respondent\u2019s position is m isconceived. There is an inherent \ninternal contradiction in the Respondent\u2019s stance. Despite consistently maintaining that the \nRespondent was not able or empowered to approve awn ings before the commencement of \nthis Application, the Respondent issued guidelines for retractable awnings on 17 April \n2019. The Respondent\u2019s issuance of such guidelines must mean that the Respondent had \nby its action conceded that it had the power to pre scribe awnings in the face of the \u201ckiller\u201d \nlitter problem. If the guidelines for retractable a wnings were issued earlier, this Application \nmay not have been necessary.    \n \n8.  As a matter of law, the Board is of the view that t he Respondent\u2019s earlier position that it \nwas not able or empowered to approve the awnings is  wrong. Under the Building \nMaintenance and Strata Management Act (Cap 30C) (\u201cB MSMA\u201d), the management \ncorporation is tasked to \u201ccontrol, manage and admin ister the common property for the \nbenefit of all the subsidiary proprietors constitut ing the management corporation\u201d (see \nsection 29(1)(a) of the BMSMA). Any alteration to t he common property would require \nprior written approval from the management corporat ion. This is enshrined in paragraph \n5(1) of the 2 nd  Schedule to Building Maintenance (Strata Managemen t) Regulations 2005 \n(\u201cBMSMR 2005\u201d) which stipulate the prescribed by-la ws for every strata development. \nParagraph 5(1) provides that: \n \nA subsidiary proprietor or an occupier of a lot sha ll not mark, paint, drive nails or \nscrews or the like into, or otherwise damage or def ace, any structure that forms part of \nthe common property except with the prior written a pproval of the management \ncorporation. \n    Pang Loon Ong and Others   STB No. 21 of 2019 (D\u2019Le edon) \nv The MCST Plan No. 4288                                                                                              \n \nPage 5 of 11  \n 9.  However, this general rule is qualified by paragrap h 5(3) of the 2 nd  Schedule to the \nBMSMR 2005 which provides: \n \nThis by-law shall not prevent a subsidiary propriet or or an occupier of a lot, or a person \nauthorised by such subsidiary proprietor or occupie r from installing \u2014 \n(a) any locking or other safety device  for protection of the subsidiary proprietor\u2019s or \noccupier\u2019s lot against intruders or to improve safety within that lot ;  \n(b) any screen or other device to prevent entry of ani mals or insects on the lot; \n(c) any structure or device  to prevent harm to children ; or \n(d)any device used to affix decorative items to the in ternal surfaces of walls in the \nsubsidiary proprietor\u2019s or occupier\u2019s lot. (emphasi s added) \n \n \n10.  Paragraph 5(3) of the 2 nd  Schedule to the BMSMR 2005 allows subsidiary propr ietors to \ninstall a safety device to improve safety within th at lot or any structure or device  in order \nto prevent harm to children. In Ahmad bin Ibrahim and 21 others v The MCST Plan No.  \n4131  (\u201cThe Belysa\u201d)  STB No. 119 of 2017, the Board held that the wordi ng of this \nparagraph is wide enough to encompass the installat ion of awnings in response to a \u201ckiller\u201d \nlitter problem. This Board would like to remind man agement corporations of what was said \nin The Belysa i.e. that \u201cin the management of any strata developm ent, the management \ncorporation should be guided by the principle that children\u2019s safety must be considered to \nbe of paramount importance\u201d (see The Belysa at [16]). As one of the world\u2019s leading \nauthority on strata titles, Cathy Sherry, perceptiv ely observes in her monograph, Strata \nTitle Property Rights[ :] Private Governance of Multi-Owned Properties  (Routledge, 2017) \nat 198: \n \n[Children\u2019s] presence in strata and community schem es is increasing, and their \nwell-being is fundamental not just to themselves an d their families, but to the entire \ncommunity, which needs them to become functional ad ults of the future.  \n \n11.  In a land-scarce country like Singapore, Sherry\u2019s o bservation is even more apposite as the \nmajority of the population including children live in multi-owned properties. The \nRespondent\u2019s position that a management corporation  is not empowered or unable to act if \nthe requisite votes are not obtained at the Annual General Meeting even though the \nsubsidiary proprietors are facing a serious \u201ckiller \u201d litter problem is an unedifying view \nwhich this Board unequivocally rejects. To leave su ch serious issues solely to the province \nof majority rule is inappropriate. As Sherry in Strata Title Property Rights[ :] Private \nGovernance of Multi-Owned Properties  (Routledge, 2017) at 218 notes: Pang Loon Ong and Others   STB No. 21 of 2019 (D\u2019Le edon) \nv The MCST Plan No. 4288                                                                                              \n \nPage 6 of 11  \n  \nThe majority may act in ways that are harmful to ot hers, including children, even \nto the point of making decisions that are inimical to their physical safety. \n \nIf the Respondent is correct, this might result in a stalemate and intolerable situation. This \ncannot be right. The concept of majority rule in a strata development in this context cannot \nbe taken to the extreme when the safety of children  is at stake. It cannot be Parliament\u2019s \nintention for a management corporation to be impote nt in the face of such a pressing \nproblem faced by its residents. We urge management corporations not to adopt such an \nimpractical and illogical interpretation of the reg ulatory framework governing strata \ndevelopments and work with the subsidiary proprieto rs to resolve the problem at hand.   \n \n12.  It should also be noted that the Respondent\u2019s argum ent that it was not empowered to issue \nguidelines without the necessary approval from the Annual General Meeting was rejected \nin Zou Xiong v MCST Plan No. 2360 (\u201c 19 Shelford Road \u201d) [2017] SGSTB 5 at [31] \u2013 [32] \nwhere the Board observed (in the context of safety grilles): \nThe Respondent submits that it cannot give approval  for the Applicant\u2019s application to \ninstall invisible grilles because the proposed work s affect the facade of the building \nand such approval is to be given by the general bod y and not by the Respondent. The \nBoard takes the view that this reasoning is unsatis factory because it is within the \nRespondent\u2019s power to give such an approval. It is the Respondent\u2019s role to put in \nplace a set of design guidelines for the installati on of safety grilles that address both \nthe safety issues and the issues regarding the faca de of the Development, so that the \nsubsidiary proprietors can comply with such guideli nes.  Where there is no design \nguidelines, the subsidiary proprietor\u2019s application  for the installation of invisible \ngrilles have to be decided on a case-by-case basis.  In exercising its power, the \nRespondent should not defer its responsibility to t he general body. \nThe Board also observes that the Respondent had, fo r other subsidiary proprietors, \nconsidered and approved their application for insta llation works that affect the facade \nof the building. As such, the Board cannot accept t hat the Respondent in this case is \nnot able to do the same. Even if the Respondent\u2019s p osition was correct, the Respondent \nshould have adopted a more active role to facilitat e the Applicant in his application, \nespecially in a case such as this where children\u2019s safety is concerned. The Respondent \nought to take the initiative to provide the guideli nes for its subsidiary proprietors and \nit is not for the Applicant to initiate an approval  for such guidelines. (emphasis added) \n Pang Loon Ong and Others   STB No. 21 of 2019 (D\u2019Le edon) \nv The MCST Plan No. 4288                                                                                              \n \nPage 7 of 11  \n 13.  While the observations above were made in relation to safety grilles, this Board is of the \nview that the same principles apply in relation to awnings where there is a \u201ckiller\u201d litter \nproblem.  \n \n14.  Sundaresh Menon CJ in Sit Kwong Lam v Management Corporation Strata Title  Plan No \n2645 (\u201c The Ardmore Park \u201d)  [2018] 1 SLR 790 at [72] interpreted paragraph 5(3) (c) of the \n2nd  Schedule to the BMSMR 2005 in the following manner : \n \nReading the exception in by-law 5(3)( c) in a consistent way, we were of the view that \nit must similarly be limited to the situation where  a subsidiary proprietor erected a \nstructure or device on common property in order to prevent harm to children while \nthey were within his lot . (emphasis in the original) \n \n15.  Two important points may be gleaned from this passa ge. First, the learned Chief Justice \ndescribed paragraph 5(3)(c) of the 2 nd  Schedule to the BMSMR 2005 as an \u2018exception\u2019 to \nthe general rule that the management corporation\u2019s consent must be obtained before a \nstructure or device on common property is erected. Second, the passage did not \ncontemplate that this \u2018exception\u2019 is subject to the  necessary votes being obtained at the \nAnnual General Meeting. Thus, The Ardmore Park  supports this Board\u2019s conclusion that \nunder existing law the Respondent did have the powe r to prescribe guidelines in relation \nto awnings when there is a \u201ckiller\u201d litter problem to prevent harm to children while they \nwere within a subsidiary proprietor\u2019s lot.  \n \n16.  We note that the BMSMA was recently amended with th e introduction of section 37A of \nthe BMSMA. Section 37A of the BMSMA provides as fol lows: \n \n37A. \u2014(1) A subsidiary proprietor of a lot in a building  on a parcel comprised in a \nstrata title plan may install safety equipment on t he lot, or as part of any window, door \nor opening on the lot which is facing outdoors, des pite any other provision of this Act \nor the regulations or any by-law of the parcel whic h otherwise prohibits the installation \nof such safety equipment. \n(2)   A subsidiary proprietor of a lot in a building who installs safety equipment under \nthis section must \u2014 \n(a) repair any damage caused to any part of the common property or limited \ncommon property (as the case may be) by the install ation of the safety \nequipment; and Pang Loon Ong and Others   STB No. 21 of 2019 (D\u2019Le edon) \nv The MCST Plan No. 4288                                                                                              \n \nPage 8 of 11  \n (b) ensure that the safety equipment is installed in a competent and proper manner \nand has an appearance, after it has been installed,  in keeping with the \nappearance of the building. \n \n(3)   In this section, \u201csafety equipment\u201d means \u2014 \n(a) any of the following features to prevent people fro m falling over the edge of \nan outdoor- facing balcony or terrace or a window or door or an  opening which \nis outdoor-facing: \n(i)  a window grille or screen; \n(ii)  a balustrade, railing or fence; \n \n(b) any device capable of restricting the opening of a window or door or an \nopening which is outdoor-facing; \n(c) any screen or other device to prevent entry of anim als or insects on the lot; \n(d) an intruder alarm or monitoring system; and \n(e) any lock or other security mechanism that is design ed to protect occupiers of \nthe lot against intruders to the lot. \n \n \n17.  The definition of \u201csafety equipment\u201d in section 37A  of BMSMA does not appear to include \nawnings. Does the amendment mean that Parliament ha d by implication excluded the \nmanagement corporation\u2019s power to prescribe guideli nes in relation to awnings to counter \na \u201ckiller\u201d litter problem? This Board is of the vie w that a careful analysis of the statutory \nframework will show that section 37A of the BMSMA d id not affect a management \ncorporation\u2019s ability to prescribe guidelines with respect to awnings if there is a \u201ckiller\u201d \nlitter problem. Section 37A of the BMSMA deals with  the specific issue of \u201csafety \nequipment\u201d and not \u201cany structure or device to prev ent harm to children\u201d mentioned in \nparagraph 5(3)(c) of the 2 nd  Schedule to the BMSMR 2005. The omission to deal w ith these \nother structures or devices in section 37A did not,  in this Board\u2019s view, signal an intention \nby Parliament to abolish the subsidiary proprietor\u2019 s rights to install these items to protect \ntheir children.  In other words, section 37A of the  BMSMA did not preclude a subsidiary \nproprietor from installing any structure or device on common property to prevent harm to \na child while the child is within his or her lot an d the management corporation may \nprescribe guidelines in relation to the installatio n of such devices or structures. This \ninterpretation is fortified by paragraph 5(4) of th e 2 nd  Schedule to the BMSMR 2005 which \nprovides: \nAny such locking or safety device, screen, other device or structure  must be installed \nin a competent and proper manner and must have an a ppearance, after it has been \ninstalled, in keeping with such guidelines as the management c orporation may Pang Loon Ong and Others   STB No. 21 of 2019 (D\u2019Le edon) \nv The MCST Plan No. 4288                                                                                              \n \nPage 9 of 11  \n prescribe regarding such installations , and with the appearance of the rest of the \nbuilding. (emphasis added) \n \n18.  Thus, it is clear that management corporations may prescribe guidelines in relation to \nawnings which may fall within the definition of \u201cot her device or structure\u201d when there is a \n\u201ckiller\u201d litter problem.   \n \n19.  In light of the above, the Respondent\u2019s earlier pos ition that it was not empowered or unable \nto prescribe the installation of the awnings is err oneous.  \n \nWhether the Installation of Retractable Awnings is a Reasonable, Necessary & Proportionate \nResponse \n20.  In The Belysa , the Board said that even though paragraph 5(3) of  the 2 nd  Schedule to \nBMSMR 2005 permits installations of awnings, these awnings must be a necessary, \nreasonable and proportionate  response to the killer litter problem. In the pres ent case, the \nApplicants would prefer to install a fixed awning w hereas the Respondent belatedly \nprescribed guidelines to install retractable awning s.  \n \n21.  During the course of the arbitration hearing on 7 M ay 2019, it became clear that due to the \ncurvature of the Applicants\u2019 units that there might  be complications in relation to providing \nadequate coverage using retractable awnings. While a fixed awning is able to accommodate \nthe curved exterior wall, the installation of retra ctable awnings may result in a gap in the \ncoverage at the curved exterior wall.   \n \n22.  After the arbitration hearing on 7 May 2019, the Re spondent proceeded to call a further \nwitness to testify that the installation of retract able awnings was able to provide for the gap \nin the coverage at the area of curvature. When the matter was heard again on 29 May 2019, \nthe Respondent called Ms Ng Hwee Theng who is the g eneral manager of HLH Singapore \nPte Ltd. According to Ms Ng, it is possible to prov ide full coverage (including the area at \nthe curved exterior wall) by installing three (3) s eparate retractable awnings. Furthermore, \nMs Ng\u2019s drawing showed that the lowest part of the awnings would be estimated to be 1.9 \nmetres. This was challenged by the Applicants who a rgued that that the lowest part of the \nawnings would be around 1.55 metres.  \n \n23.   In light of Ms Ng\u2019s evidence, this Board sees no r eason to disagree with the Respondent \nthat the installation of retractable awnings instea d of fixed awnings is a necessary, \nreasonable and proportionate response to solving th e \u201ckiller\u201d litter problem. In relation to Pang Loon Ong and Others   STB No. 21 of 2019 (D\u2019Le edon) \nv The MCST Plan No. 4288                                                                                              \n \nPage 10  of 11  \n the contention as to the height of the lowest part of the retractable awnings, this Board \nquotes the judgment of The Belysa  at [25] where the Board said: \n \nthe Applicants\u2019 contention that inclination of the retractable awnings would mean that \nan adult would not be able to stand in every part o f the subsidiary proprietor\u2019s lot due \nto height restrictions ought to be rejected. The is sue at hand is not to find a perfect \nsolution which would meet the Applicants\u2019 every nee d. Instead, the proper inquiry is \nto find a reasonable, necessary and proportionate r esponse to solve the problem of \n\u201ckiller\u201d litter.   \n \n24.  We note Chan Sek Keong CJ writing extra-judicially in Tan Sook Yee\u2019s Principles of \nSingapore Land Law , (3 rd  ed: LexisNexis, 2009) at viii who expressed the fo llowing view: \n \nThe law should provide optimal conditions for land use in Singapore and the common \nlaw principles should, whenever possible, be applie d to promote, rather than hinder, \nthe social and economic needs of the community.  \n \nWhile Chan Sek Keong CJ was referring to common law  principles, this Board is of the \nview that a similar philosophy should be adopted in  relation to interpreting the regulatory \nframework governing strata developments.  \n \n25.  In the present case, the statute and social policy considerations dictate that the installation \nof retractable awnings is necessary to protect the subsidiary proprietors and their children.  \n \n \nBOARD\u2019S ORDER \n \n26.  The Applicants\u2019 action is allowed to the extent tha t the Applicants are entitled to install \nretractable awnings as per the guidelines prescribe d by the Respondent.  \n \n27.

In this case, the applicants, who at the point of time when the application was filed, were \nthe subsidiary proprietors of #XXX in the development known as Le Crescendo (the \n\u201cDevelopment \u201d) at 233 Paya Lebar Road Singapore 409044. They applied for a refund of\nPage 2 of 10 How Ah Meng and Hedy Goh Kim Kee STB No.121 of 2018 (Le Crescendo)  \nv MCST Plan No. 3127  \nPage 3 of 10 a sum of $2899.03 t hat was paid to the  respondent, the management corporation  of the \nDevelopment shortly  before they ceased to be subsidiary proprietors  in the D evelopment . \nBACKGROUND  \n2. Before thi s application was filed by the applicants, the respondent had filed an application  \nat the Strata Titles Boards (\u201cthe STB\u201d) for an order against Tay Boon Yong (\u201cTay\u201d ), the \nsubsidiary proprietor of #XXX in the Development in connection with structures erected  \nby the subsidiary proprietor without approval from the respondent (STB No. 84 of 2017,  \nMCST Plan No. 3127 v Tay Boon Yong (\u201cthe 2017 case\u201d )) (see paragraph 8 below for \nbackground to the 2017 case). The 2017 case was resolved by way of a consent order but \nthe parties were unable to resolve the dispute in connection with costs.\n3. The respondent had in connection with the 2017 case incurred legal costs amounting to\n$20,000 and an application was made to the Strata Titles Board for the 2017 case (\u201cthe \n2017 Board\u201d) for an order for costs on an indemnity basis to be made against Tay. The \n2017 Board declined to award costs on an indemnity basis and on 10 April 2018 awarded \nagainst Tay costs of $4000 plus reimbursement of fees payable to the STB and reasonable  \ndisbursements.\n4. On 11 July 2018, the respondent sought a payment of $2899.03 from the applicants who, \nas earlier noted, were at that point of time the subsidiary proprietors residing at #XXX.\n5. The letter from the respondent on 11 July 2018 was headed:\nLE CRESCENDO #XXX  \u2013 REIMBURSEMENT OF LEGAL COST IN PURSUANT OF \nUNAUTHORISED STRUCTURE AT OPEN TERRACE\n6. The letter referred to a resolution of an issue of unauthorised structures with the STB (the \n2017 case was not mentioned in the letter); that legal fees was incurred in the matter; and \nthat reimbursement of legal costs amounting to $2899.03 was being sought from the \napplicants.How Ah Meng and Hedy Goh Kim Kee STB No.121 of 2018 (Le Crescendo)  \nv MCST Plan No. 3127  \nPage 4 of 10 7. The applicants were of the view that the respondent was claiming \u201clegal costs\u201d  which \nwere not awarded by the 2017 Board and were not agreeable to pay as inter alia they were \nnot parties in the proceedings between the respondent and Tay in the 2017 case; and they  \nwere also of the view the respondent did not have the power to pass by-laws in relation  \nto recovery of legal costs incurred in matters against MCST residents.\n8. A perusal of the \u201cSubmission by Respondent/Management Corporation/Person Invited to \nMake Submission\u201d (Form 18A) sets out that there was (according to the respondent) an \nillegal structure in the applicants\u2019 unit when the applicants took possession the unit in \nAugust 2011. There was correspondence between the applicants and the respondent in \nconnection with this matter between 17 Marc h 2014 and 26 May 2018. At the point of \ntime when the respondent filed the 2017 case, there were three units including the \napplicants with illegal structures. Instead of filing applications against subsidiary \nproprietors of all the three units at the same time, a decision was taken by the respondent  \nto first proceed against the subsidiary proprietor of #XXX in the 2017 case. As mentioned  \nearlier, the 2017 case was settled with a consent order . At the conclusion of the 2017 case, \nthe respondent\u2019s position was that the applicants could legally erect and correct the \nunauthorised structure in their unit.\n9. The respondent had incurred legal costs totalling $8679.08 when seeking advice in \nconnection with the unauthorised structures in the three units and it was the respondent\u2019s \nposition that the applicants were liable for one third of the costs. The respondent was of  \nthe view that it was in order to require the applicants to pay this amount because at all the \nannual general meetings of the respondent between 28 December 2013 (7th Annual \nGeneral Meeting) and 16 December 2017 (11th Annual General Meeting) of the \nManagement Corporation held on 28 December 2013 it was:\nresolved that all costs including legal costs on an indemnity basis, disbursements and  \nincidental costs incurred by the management corporation to enforce or try to enforce any \nparty\u2019s compliance with the Building Management and Strata Management Act, other \nstatutes, subsidiary legislation, by law shall be recoverable from the party concerned.How Ah Meng and Hedy Goh Kim Kee   STB No.121 of 2018 (Le Crescendo)  \nv MCST Plan No. 3127    \nPage 5 of 10 \n 10. The applicants, as mentioned  earlier , were not prepared to and did not agree to make the \npayment requested. The applicant s were at that point of time in the process of selling their \nlot in the Development and the lawyers acting for the purchasers had made an application \nto the respon dent for a certificate under section 47(1)(c) of the Building Maintenance and \nStrata Management Act. Cap 30C (the \u201cAct\u201d). \n11.

Following the application from the lawyers for the prospective purchaser , the respondent  \nhad on 23 July 2018 inter alia certified that in relation to the applicants \u2019 lot the following \nwere outstanding as at 15 July 2018 : \nManagement Fund  $1200.00      01 Jul 18 to 30 Sep 18  \nSinking Fund           $150.00        01 Jul 18 to 30 Sep 18  \nLegal Costs             $2899.0 3      11 Jul 201 8 \nTotal                     $4249.03  \n14. On 23 Aug ust 2018, the applicants, for the purpose of completing their sale with the \nprospective purchaser paid the management corporation legal costs of $2899.03. The \napplicants  reiterated that they did not agree that there were legal costs outstanding as an \nunpaid c ontribution under section s 39(1), 39(2) and 40 of the Act and that the management \ncorporation did not have any basis for the claim.  \n15. The applicants are now seeking for an order for the respondent  to refund the amount paid.  \n16. The order that the applicants  are seeking is for the Board to order the respondent to refund \nto the applicants a payment that the applicants  have made to the respondent  i.e. money \nwas paid to the management corporation when there was, in the view of the applicants , \nno legal obligation to pay.  The application in this case is in effect a cl aim for moneys had \nand received.  \n17. The applicants  submitted that the Board can and has the power to make the order under \nsection 108 of the Act. The respondent  inter alia submitted that, because the appl icants \nare not at this point of time subsidiary proprietors in the Development , the Board did not \nhave jurisdiction to consider the application.   \nBOARD \u2019S DECISION  \n18. The applicants  had, in this case , submitted the ir application to the STB on 27 Aug ust \n2018, one day before the sale of the unit was completed on 28 Aug ust 2018. The Board \nwas, under Regulation 6 of the Building Maintenance and Strata Management (Strata How Ah Meng and Hedy Goh Kim Kee   STB No.121 of 2018 (Le Crescendo)  \nv MCST Plan No. 3127    \nPage 7 of 10 \n Titles Boards) Regulations 2005  (\u201cthe 2005 Regulations \u201d), constituted on 5 October 2018 \nand the first mediation was held on 5 November 2018.  \n19. Section 89(2) of the Act provides  that: \nUnless otherwise provided by this Act or the Land Titles (Strata) Act (Cap  158), a Board \nshall determine by mediation -arbitration every dispute of which it has cognizance and \nevery matter with respect to which it has jurisdiction under this Act or that Act .  \n20. Accordingly, a Board can make a determination only with regard to matters wit h respect \nto which it has jurisdiction under the Act or the Land Titles (Strata) Act . It cannot make \ndeterminations on matters  over which the Act has not given it any jurisdiction.  \n21. The STB was established to adjudicate disputes between  the subsidiary propr ietors and \nmanagement corporations  and between one su bsidiary proprietor and another. The \nintention was that the courts would not be overloaded with such disputes.  \n22. Part VI Division 2 of the Act (sections 101 - 120) sets out the various orders that can be \nmade by the Board and the parties who can apply for the orders.  \nJurisdiction to consider the application  \n23. It is not in dispute that when the parties appeared before the Board the applicants were \nnot the subsidiary proprietors in the Development. They were, however the subsidiary \nproprietors when the application was filed pursuant to Regulation 3 of the 2005 \nRegulations,  and the Board is of the view that it is at this point of time that a determination \nis made as to whether or not the Board has jurisdiction over the matter. Accordingly, the \nBoard is of the view that it has jurisdiction to consider and determine the application.  \nPower to make the order sought  \n24. After determining that there was jurisdiction to consider the application, the Board \nproceeded to determine the issue as to whether there was any power under the Act for the \nBoard to make the order applied for.  How Ah Meng and Hedy Goh Kim Kee   STB No.121 of 2018 (Le Crescendo)  \nv MCST Plan No. 3127    \nPage 8 of 10 \n 25. This is a case where a \u201cpayer \u201d had made a payment to \u201cpayee \u201d when the payer was of the \nview  that the payee did not have a legal right to require the payment and is now seeking \nan order for the money to be refunded . \n26. It was, as noted earlier, the submission of the applicants  that the order can be ma de under \nsection 108 of the Act  which reads as fo llows:  \nOrder varying contributions, etc.  \n108.\u2014 (1) Where, pursuant to an application by a management corporation, a subsidiary \nmanagement corporation, a subsidiary proprietor or a mortgagee in possession (whether \nby himself or another person), a Board considers that any amount levied or proposed to \nbe levied by way of contributions \u2014 \n(a) under section 40 or 41(3) or (4) in respect of a lot in a subdivided building \nwhere planning permission for the development of land was granted prior \nto  15th April 1976; or  \n(b) under section 41(3) or (4) in respect of a lot in a subdivided building where \nplanning permission for the development of land was granted on or after \n15th April 1976, is inadequate or excessive or the manner of payment of \ncontributions is unreasonable, the Board may make either or both of the \nfollowing orders:  \n (i) an order for the payment of contributions of a different amount with \neffect from such date as the Board determines;  \n(ii)  an order for the payment of contributions in a different  manner.  \n(2)  Where an order of a Board under subsection ( 1) takes effect in  relation to a \n contribution levied by a management corporation or  subsidiary management \n corporation, as the case may be, that has been  wholly or partly paid in respect of a \n lot, the management corporation  or subsidiary management corporation shall be \n deemed to have  imposed a levy of the amount determined by the Board with effect  \n from such date as the Board determines.  \n(3)  Notwithstanding section 40(2), an order may be made by a  Board under subsection \n (1) for the payment of any amount which the  Board thinks is fair and adequate.  How Ah Meng and Hedy Goh Kim Kee   STB No.121 of 2018 (Le Crescendo)  \nv MCST Plan No. 3127    \nPage 9 of 10 \n (4)  For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this section shall  authorise any Board to alter \n the share value of any lot shown in a  strata title plan in any manner on or after the \n date the management  corporation is constituted.  \n27. It is clear that the section is concerned with contributions levied by the management \ncorporation on subsidiary proprietors under sections 40, 41(3) or 41(4) of the Act. The \norders that can be made under section 108 are i) an order for a payment of a different \namount ; and/or ii) an order for a payment of the contribution in a different manner.  \n28. Under section 40 of the Act , a management corporation can levy contributions in \naccordance with sections 39(1),  39(2), 41, and contributions referred to in section 39(3). \nSuch contributio ns are by virtue of section 40(2) payable by subsidiary proprietors in \nshares proportional to the share value of their respective lots. The section is concerned \nwith contributions (the amount would have been determined at a general meeting) that all \nthe su bsidiary proprietors are obliged to pay in accordance with the share value of the \nrespective lots. Under section 108 , the Board can vary the amount that was determined at \nthe general meeting when the Board is of the view that the amount is inadequate or \nexcessive and the Board has also been given a power to order the payment of the \ncontribution to be in a manner other than in accordance with share value which is the \nprescribed  manner.  \n29. Sections 41(3) and 41(4) are not relevant in this case as the sections ar e in relation to \nadditional contributions approved by the Commissioner of Buildings when a lot has been \nsub-divided; where a change of use of the lot has been approved by the competent \nauthority; or when improvements in or upon a lot have been effected in accordance with \nsection 37 of the Act . \n30. The payment that was made by the applicants  in this case was not for an amount that was \ndetermined at a general meeting that all subsidiary proprietors are required to pay. It was \nnot a contribution that was levied in  accordance with sections 39(1),  39(2), 41, or a \ncontribution referred to in section 39(3). It was p ursuant to a by -law that was made in \nconnection with legal costs incurred by the management corporation for the purpose of How Ah Meng and Hedy Goh Kim Kee   STB No.121 of 2018 (Le Crescendo)  \nv MCST Plan No. 3127    \nPage 10 of 10 \n enforcing compliance with the Act  and the by -laws that the respondent required the \napplicants to make the payment and payment was made.  \n31. Whilst it is the case for the applicants  that there was no obligation on their part to make \nthe payment and that the by -law under which the respondent had required the payment \nwas not a valid by -law, section 108 does not provide for an order to be made for the refund \nof such a payment.  \n32. The Board is in this case not expressing any views as to whether or not it was in order for \nthe management corporation t o require the payment from the applicant s as this was not  \nthe issue in this case.  \n33. Accordingly, t he application is dismissed . \nDated this 11th day of February 2019  \n  ____________________________ ___ \nMr Remedios F.G  \nDeputy President  \n  _______________________________  \nProfessor  Teo Keang Sood  \nMember  \n  _______________________________  \nMr Lawrence Ang  \nMember  \nApplicant s in person   \nOng Beng Hui (Chairman ) and Boey Ghim Chiew  (Secretary ) for the Respondent  \n "

The Applicant Poh Beng Swee is the subsidiary proprietor of Block 202 Loyang Avenue, \nunit #XXX  Loyang Valley, Singapore 509059.\n2. The Respondent Teo Siew Yam is the subsidiary proprietor of unit #XXX  in the same \ndevelopment.\n3. The Respondent\u2019s unit is directly above the applicant\u2019s unit.\nTHE APPLICANT\u2019S CASE \n4. The Applicant had since 2015 complained to the Respondent that water had been leaking \nfrom the Respondent\u2019s unit into the Applicant\u2019s master bedroom toilet and the adjacent \nroom.\n5. The Applicant said that nothing had been done by the Respondent to correct the leakage \nand he had no choice but to engage his own contractor to repair the leakage into his unit \nat his own expense by grouting method. However, the leakage continued and he said the \nrepairs ought to have been carried out at the Respondent\u2019s unit to be effective and the \nRespondent was not co-operating.\n6. As the Respondent was disputing that the source of the leakage was not from his unit, the \nApplicant had engaged an expert Er Teoh Eng Giap to inspect both his and the \nRespondent\u2019s unit and to put up a report.\n7. Er Teoh said that he inspected the Applicant\u2019s unit on the 17 September 2018 only as he \nhad no access to unit #XXX above. He concluded that the source of the water seepage \nwas from the Respondent\u2019s master bedroom toilet and the likely cause was the \ndamaged /defective waterproofing especially around the outlet pipes on the floor and \nalong its perimeter walls/kerbs inside the toilet room at unit #XXX. As the water \nseepage had occurred over a long duration of time, the water had spread to the adjacent \nbedroom in #XXX .\n8. Er Teoh said that he inspected both the Applicant\u2019s unit and the Respondent\u2019s unit again \non 26 September 2018 as he was allowed access into the Respondent\u2019s unit. He put up a \nsecond report. He found severe water seepage signs in the Respondent\u2019s master bedroomPoh Beng Swee  STB No. 32 of 2018 (Loyang Valley) \nv Teo Siew Yam \nPage 4 of 6 toilet. The condition in the Applicant\u2019s unit remained the same. He again concluded that \nthe water seepage was clearly from the Respondent\u2019s toilet into unit #XXX. \n9. As the Respondent was still not convinced, a water ponding test was carried out with the\nconsent of Respondent in her master bedroom toilet. This was done on the 1 October 2018\nin his presence and the Respondent\u2019s expert\u2019s presence by a mutually agreed\nwaterproofing specialist \u2013 Proof Tech Waterproofing and Maintenance Pte Ltd. Pink\ncoloured dye was used. A joint inspection was conducted by both the experts on the 6\nOctober 2018 together with the waterproofing specialist in both the units. Pink water in\nthe Respondent\u2019s toilet disappeared, there was pink colour detected in the Applicant\u2019s\ntoilet, master bedroom and the adjacent room.\n10. Er Teoh concluded that the water ponding test reaffirms his previous findings.\nTHE RESPONDENT\u2019S CASE \n11. The Respondent denied that the source of the seepage was from her unit. The \nRespondent\u2019s husband Tan Eng Seng (RW1) said he had carried out waterproofing in his \nmaster bedroom toilet using chemical infusion and the Applicant still complained of the \nleakage. He therefore, engaged his own expert - an Architect called Tan Kheng Giap \nLeonard, to inspect both the Applicant\u2019s unit and the Respondent\u2019s unit to determine the \nsource of the seepage and to put up a report.\n12. Architect Tan said that he inspected both the units on the 26 September 2018, 1 October \n2018 and on 6 October 2018. He put up a report dated November 2018. He concluded that \nthe water seepage into unit #XXX could be due to a variety of causes. He listed the \nfollowing as possible causes:\ni. damaged waterproofing membrane caused by the previous grouting works.\nii. leakage from common property such as damaged service pipes and water-filled \nconduit pipes embedded in the concrete.\niii. roots of young plants growing on the flat roof.\niv. rainwater from some defective external walls.Poh Beng Swee  STB No. 32 of 2018 (Loyang Valley) \nv Teo Siew Yam \nPage 5 of 6 13. He, however, said that \u201cthe only possible source of leakage that can possibly be attributed\nto #XXX is from the master bedroom ceiling and even then, these were caused by the \nApplicant\u2019s grouting work at the underside of the slab\u201d.\nBOARD\u2019S FINDINGS \n14. It is not disputed that there was water seepage into the Applicant\u2019s unit. The issue is where\nwas the source of the seepage and whether the Respondent is responsible and therefore\nliable to repair the seepage and to make good the damages caused as a result.\n15. The Board has examined the three reports put up by the Applicant\u2019s expert Er Teoh and\nthe report by the Respondent\u2019s Architect Tan Kheng Giap Leonard.\n16. Er Teoh\u2019s conclusion in all his three reports were consistent and concise.\n17. Architect Tan\u2019s report was somewhat vague and contained many possibilities of the\ncauses of the seepage with no tests conducted and no final conclusion as to the source. He\naccepted during the cross examination that all his conclusions were possibilities and not\nprobabilities.\n18. On a balance of probabilities, the Board accepts the three reports of Er Teoh and finds that\nthe seepage into the Applicant\u2019s master bedroom toilet, the master bedroom and adjacent\nroom was from the master bedroom toilet of the Respondent\u2019s unit.\n19. The Board is of the view that the water ponding test clearly supports Er Teoh\u2019s findings.\nThere was no evidence adduced by the Respondent that the previous grouting works had\ncaused damage to the water membrane as alleged by the Respondent\u2019s expert.\n20. The Board is satisfied on the evidence adduced by the Applicant that there was a loss of\nrental. The tenant terminated his lease due to the severe leakage. However, the Board is\nnot satisfied that sufficient efforts have been made by the Applicant to rent out his\npremises after the tenant left.\nBOARD\u2019S ORDERS \n21. The Board makes the following orders: -Poh Beng Swee  STB No. 32 of 2018 (Loyang Valley) \nv Teo Siew Yam \nPage 6 of 6 i. The Respondent is to carry out the repair works in her master bedroom toilet as\nrecommended by Er Teoh in paragraph 3.5 of his report dated 17 September 2018\nwithin two weeks of this order.\nii. The Respondent is to make good all the damages caused by the seepage in the\nApplicant\u2019s master bedroom toilet, master bedroom and the adjacent room within\ntwo weeks of this order.\niii. The Respondent shall compensate the Applicant on his loss of rental. The amount\nis to be determined.\niv. The Respondent shall pay the Applicant the cost of this application.\n22. The Board will hear the parties on the cost and the quantum of damages to be awarded.\nDated this  19th day of December 2018 \n  _______________________________  \nMr Seng Kwang Boon \nDeputy President \n _______________________________ \nMr Tony Tay Chye Teck \nMember \n _______________________________ \nMs Elaine Chew \nMember \n Mr Lim Soo Peng (Lim Soo Peng & Co LLP) for the Applicant \nMr Walter Silvester (Silvester Legal LLC) for the Respondent "

In December 2017, the Applicants acquired their unit and began renovations. Their contractor,\na director from HAP Studio Pte Ltd (\u201c HAP \u201d), found that there was water leakage in the\nApplicants\u2019 master bedroom toilet and the common toilet.\n5. The Applicants raised the water leakage issue to the managing committee of the estate (\u201cthe\nMCST \u201d). From December 2017 to April 2018, the Applicants had left the matter for the MCST\nto deal directly with the Respondents. During this period, the MCST engaged two independent\nwater seepage specialists namely, IGM Construction (S) Pte Ltd (\u201c IGM\u201d)  and SiD Solutions\nPte Ltd (\u201c SiD\u201d). Having inspected the Applicants\u2019 unit, the two independent water seepage\nspecialists concluded that the water leakage emanated from the Respondents\u2019 unit. Despite the\nMCST\u2019s efforts to contact the Respondents to rectify the water leakage problem, the\nRespondents were unresponsive and/or uncooperative.\n6. It was only at the beginning of April 2018 that the Applicants and the Respondents (\u201c Parties\u201d)\nbegan to communicate directly to try to resolve the matter. Unfortunately, communications\nbetween the Parties broke down and the Parties could not arrive at a resolution.\n7. On 10 May 2018, the Applicants filed this application.\nBOARD\u2019S DECISION \nRespondents\u2019 failure to rebut statutory presumption \n8. The Board finds that there was overwhelming evidence that water had emanated from the\nRespondents\u2019 unit  and seeped into the Applicants\u2019 unit. The Applicants had engaged an expert\nfrom a firm specializing in building surveys. In the expert\u2019s report dated September 2018, the\ncause of the water leakage was attributed to the air-conditioning pipe or the water supply pipe.\nThe same expert witness also testified during the hearing that the water had leaked from the\nattached toilet of the Respondents\u2019 unit to the Applicants\u2019 unit. SiD attributed the water leakage\nto a defective concealed water pipe in its report dated 27 March 2018, whilst IGM had attributed\nthe water leakage to a faulty air-conditioning discharge pipe in the Respondents\u2019 unit in a report\ndated 2 April 2018.\n9. In fact, one of the Respondents, Mr Wang Zheng Ming (\u201c Mr Wang \u201d), had stated in the\nRespondents\u2019 Opening Statement that \u201c I agree now that there is a water seepage problem \u201d. Mr\nWang had confirmed this position when he  admitted  at the hearing that \u201c \u2026there is inter-floor\nleakage issues\u201d  and \u201c\u2026 we agree that this is an inter-floor seepage based on all the information\navailable to me now actually \u201d.\n10. Section 101(8) of the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act (\u201c BMSMA \u201d), states\nas follows:Tan Toh Ken & Sim Wen Wei Sarah  STB No. 59 of 2018 (Aspen Heights) \nv Wang Zheng Ming & Chong Oi Choo \n4\n \u201c(8) In any proceedings under this section with respect to any alleged defect in \na lot or in any common property or limited common property situated \nimmediately (whether wholly or partly) above another lot or any common \nproperty or limited common property, it shall be presumed, in the absence of \nproof to the contrary, that the defect is within that lot or common property or \nlimited common property, as the case may be, above if there is any evidence of \ndampness, moisture or water penetration - \n(a) on the ceiling that forms part of the interior of the lot, common property or\nlimited common property, as the case may be, immediately below; or\n(b) on any finishing material (including plaster, panel or gypsum board)\nattached, glued, laid or applied to the ceiling that forms part of the interior\nof the lot, common property or limited common property, as the case may\nbe, immediately below.\u201d\n11. Pursuant to section 101(8) of the BMSMA, the Respondents had the onus to rebut the statutory\npresumption.\n12. In April 2018 before the commencement of this Application, the Respondents were already\ninformed by the MCST specifically and repeatedly, that the burden lies on the Respondents to\nprove that the water leakage defects were not within their unit to rebut this statutory\npresumption. The Respondents had also received the investigation reports of SiD and IGM on\n31 March 2018 and 2 April 2018 respectively from the MCST prior to the commencement of\nthis Application. Hence, the Respondents clearly had sufficient information on the water\nleakage defects from the MCST\u2019s independent experts, and knew that the onus laid on\nthemselves to adduce evidence contrary to the two independent water seepage specialists even\nbefore the commencement of this Application.\n13. Mr Wang also accepted in his cross-examination that any reasonable proprietor that wished to\noffer evidence to rebut the application of the statutory presumption would do so by engaging a\nwater seepage specialist to investigate the issue. However, during the hearing, the Respondents\ndid not adduce any independent and objective evidence to dispute the evidence of the three\nexperts and/or to rebut the statutory presumption.\n14. Accordingly, the Board is of the view that the Respondents had not rebutted the presumption\nunder section 101(8) of the BMSMA, and the Applicants have successfully proven their case.\nNo unreasonable or unprofessional conduct by Applicants and Applicants\u2019 solicitor \n15. The Respondents submitted that the Applicants had acted unreasonably and, amongst other\nthings, had refused to conduct a joint inspection and dragged the matter. The Respondents also\nalleged that the Applicants refused to share information with them to assist in an open and\nmeaningful joint inspection.Tan Toh Ken & Sim Wen Wei Sarah  STB No. 59 of 2018 (Aspen Heights) \nv Wang Zheng Ming & Chong Oi Choo \n5\n 16. In the course of mediation, the Parties had initially agreed to jointly appoint a qualified building\nsurveyor to:\n(i) Determine whether there is water leaking from the Respondents\u2019 to the Applicants\u2019\npremises;\n(ii) Ascertain the cause(s) of the water leakage; and\n(iii) Make recommendations as to the rectifications that are required to rectify the defects that\ncaused the water leakage.\nHowever, the Respondents refused to proceed as agreed thereafter. After the Respondents\u2019 \nrefusal, the Applicants proceeded to engage their own expert to inspect the premises to ascertain \nthe cause of the leakage. \n17. Having heard evidence from both Parties, the Board is of the view that the Applicants had\nconducted themselves reasonably in the course of the matter.\n18. The Respondents further submitted that the Applicants\u2019 solicitor had used unprofessional\ntactics during the hearing. The Board is of the view that the Applicants\u2019 solicitor had not\nconducted himself in an unprofessional manner overall.\nConclusion on liability \n19. Based on all the facts and evidence before the Board, the Respondents had failed to rebut the\nstatutory presumption and failed to adduce independent and objective evidence that is contrary\nto all the objective evidence from the three experts engaged by the Applicants and the MCST.\nFinally, and most importantly, the Respondents had admitted to the water leakage issue.\nAccordingly, the Board is of the view that the Applicants have proven their case and will now\nconsider the issue of damages.\nDamages\n20. The Applicants sought an order that the Respondents carry out effective and proper repairs to\nresolve the water leakage to the satisfaction of their expert.\n21. The Applicants also asked that the Respondents pay a sum of S$5,500.00 being the costs of\nrectification that was quoted by the Applicants\u2019 contractor, HAP. Save for the said quotation,\nthere was no evidence adduced as to the extent of the damage.\n22. The Board hereby orders that:\n(i) The Respondents engage, at their own costs, a building surveyor or a water seepage\nspecialist to examine and determine the remedial actions required to stop the water\nleakage to the Applicants\u2019 unit;Tan Toh Ken & Sim Wen Wei Sarah  STB No. 59 of 2018 (Aspen Heights) \nv Wang Zheng Ming & Chong Oi Choo \n6\n (ii) The Applicants shall assist and grant the necessary access to their unit for the rectification\nand/or repair work to be carried out;\n(iii) The Respondents shall engage a contractor to carry out and complete all necessary\nremedial works required to stop the water leakage;\n(iv) The Respondents engage, at their own costs, a contractor to make good the damage to the\nApplicants\u2019 unit or alternatively, for the Respondents to pay the Applicants the sum of\nS$5,500.00 being the costs of rectification quoted to the Applicants and the Respondents\nto assist and cooperate fully with the Applicants in the rectification thereof; and\n(v) The above (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) are to be completed within ten (10) weeks from the date\nof judgment.\n23.

Applicant \n... Respondent \n1. Urban Vista is a condominium housing deve lopment with 582 residential units and \nthree (3) commercial units.\n2. The Applicant is the subsidiary proprietor of three (3) commercial units, namely \n#XXX, of Urban Vista. The Applicant is also the former owner-developer of Urban \nVista.\n3. The Respondent, MCST Plan No. 4404, is the management corpo ration of Urban \nVista. Collectively, the Applicant and the Respondent shall be known as the \n\"Parties\".\n2 4Bayfront Realty Pte Ltd v\nMCST Plan No. 4404STB No. 63 of 2018 (Urban Vista)\nBACKGROUND\nThe three (3) commercial units are situated at the comer of a residential block, well\nnestled in and/or between the residential blocks on the opposite end of the land from\nthe entrance of the property. To gain access to the units, one would have to enter\nthrough the front entrance of Urban Vista, pass through residential blocks, two (2)\nswimrning pools within the common areas of the property as well as more\nresidential blocks before reaching the units at the back comer ofresidential Tower\n8. The site plan of Urban Vista is annexed to this judgement as Appendix A.\nThe Applicant had leased (two) 2 of the three (3) commercial units to a mini-mart\noperator. Visitors to the mini-mart included residents, guests of residents and\nmembers of the public who were neither residents nor guests of residents\n(\"members of the public\"). There was no restriction on visitors to the mini-mart\nfrom the time it started operations.\nMembers of the public who wanted to visit the mini-mart had to record their\npersonal details in a logbook at the security post. The security personnel would then\nissue them with visitor passes before they can enter Urban Vista. These members\nof the public would have to retum their visitor passes and record the time of their\nleave at the security post when they are leaving the property.\nOver time, there were concems of safety amongst the residents. Complaints were\nmade to the Respondent that there were unknown persons using the estate's\nfacilities. When approached by the security personnel, these persons were unable to\ndisclose any resident's unit numbers whom they claimed to be guests of. Some\nvisitor passes were not retumed and the time of leave was not recorded in the log\nbook.\nOn 24 Janrary 2018, the Respondent sent a letter to the Applicant informing that\n\" . . .the I't Management Council resolved at the dh Council Meeting held on\nSaturday, 20 January 2018 that non-residents and non-guests are not allowed to\nenter the estate to patronise the commercial units with effect from l February\n2018.\"\nIn the same letter, the Respondent referred to item m of part IV of the Urban\nRedevelopment Authority's ('URA') Grant of Written Permission (\"WP\") dated\n16 January 2013, which stated that \"The commercial shops will be for residents\nonly.\"\n10. The Applicant's architects wrote to URA on the applicability of the planning\ncondition. On 12 February 2018, URA clarified that the \"...WP condition for the\nshops to be for the resrdents only was imposed at the period of the time of\ndevelopment approval,\" and that URA has since then exercised flexibility \". ..and\nwill leave it to the MCST to decide if they wish to allow non-residents to patronize\nthe shops as well considering the comfort and wishes of the condominium\nresidents\". Hence. \"...it is for the MCST and the residents to decide for their own\ndevelopment.\"5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n3Bayfront Realty Pte Ltd v\nMCST Plan No. 4404STB No. 63 of 2018 (Urban Vista)\n1 1 . On 15 March 2018, the Respondent started denying mernbers of the public access\nto the commercial units. The mini-mart was said to have suffered losses and has\nsince closed down. The three (3) commercial units are now vacant.\n12. On 29 March 2018, the Respondent informed the Applicant that the managernent\ncorporation decided to convene an Extra-Ordinary General Meeting (\"EOGM\") to\nbe held on 5 May 2018, to decide whether to allow members of the public to enter\nthe estate to patronise the commercial units.\n13However, on 13 April 2018, the Respondent informed the Applicant that the\nmanagement corporation had decided not to proceed with the EOGM.\n14. On 7 June 2018, the Applicant corlmenced these proceedings.\n15. On 4 August 2018, the Respondent held the 2'dAnnual General Meeting (\"AGM\").\nIt was resolved by way of an ordinary resolution that the \"...management\ncorporation to continue exercising the clause stipulated in the Sale and Purchase\nAgreement (S&P) that 'The commercial shops (three (3) strata units) will be for\nresidents only. \"'\nORDER SOUGHT BY THE APPLICANT\n16. The Applicant is seeking an order that Respondent shall not prevent invitees\n(including guests, customers and staff) from entering the estate to visit any of the\nunits including commercial units.\nTHE APPLICANT'S CASE\n17. The Applicant's arguments were:\nThe Respondent was not empowered by the law to impose restrictions on\nthe type or class of persons entering a strata lot. The law envisions that\ninvitees (including customers) must be allowed to enter the strata lot;\nAlternatively, even if the Respondent was empowered to impose restrictions\non the type or class of persons entering a strata lot, there were procedural\nrequirements to do so. A by-law should be passed, with strict requirements\nto be complied with before a by-law can come into force. There was no such\nby-law passed and the legal requirements were not complied with; and\nEven if the Respondent was empowered to impose restrictions on the type\nor class of persons entering a strata lot and the Respondent had complied\nwith the procedural requirements for doing so, the Respondent's decision\nwas improper for having taken into account irrelevant considerations. The\nRespondent should not have relied on URA's WP or the Sale and Purchase\nAgreernent (\"SPA\"). The Respondent's concern over safety should be\naddressed by way of proper enforcement instead of imposing restrictions on\nthe type or class of persons entering a strata lot.a.\nb.\nc\n4Bayfront Realty Pte Ltd v\nMCST Plan No. 4404STB No. 63 of 2018 (Urban Vista)\nTHE RESPONDENT'S CASE\n18. The Respondent's arguments were:\nIt is questionable whether the Strata Titles Board (\"the Board\") had\njurisdiction to order the Respondent to allow members of the public who are\nneither residents nor guests ofresidents to enter the estate;\nIf the Board had the power, the Respondent does not consider members of\nthe public, being customers who are neither residents nor guests ofresidents\nto be \"invitees\". Therefore, such members of public or customers, should\nnot be allowed to enter the estate. The Respondent has never prevented\nguests ofresidents and the Applicant's stafffrom entering the estate;\nThe Respondent had allowed customers to patronise the commercial units.\nThese customers had to record their details into a logbook and were issued\nwith visitor passes before entering the estate. However, there were\ncustomers who would not report the time they left the property or retumed\nthe visitor passes. Accordingly, the Respondent was unable to account to the\nresidents if these customers actually left the estate. Further, residents have\ncomplained of unknown persons using the estate's facilities;\nThe Respondent had proceeded on terms granted by the WP and the SPA,\nwhich the Applicant, having been the owner-developer of the estate, would\nhave had knowledge ofthese terms and had agreed unreservedly to;\nThe Respondent had at all times fieated the Applicant with faimess and\nopenness;\nThe Respondent had no power to allow members of the public to patronise\nthe Applicant's units, and they had exercised their duties and functions\nhonestly, fairly and with reasonable diligence; an\nAt the 2nd Annual General Meeting of Urban Vista, the residents had voted\nand passed an ordinary resolution that the Applicant's units should only\nserve residents only.\nBOARD'S DECISION\n19. Having considered the submissions fiom Parties, the Board dismissed the\napplication.\nRespondent's power to restrict members of the public from entering the development\nSection 29(l)(a) of the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act (Cap.\n30C) C'BMSMA\") states as follows:b\nc\nd\nf.\n29. - (l) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (3), it shall be the duty\nof a management corporation -\n520a.Bayfront Realty Pte Ltd v\nMCST Plan No. 4404STB No. 63 of 2018 (Urban Vista)\n(a) to control, manage and administer corrmon property for the benefit of\nall the subsidiary proprietors constituting the management corporation;\n2l . The URA has clarified that the Grant of Written Permission dated 16 January 201 3\nwith conditions as stated above was only imposed at the time of development's\nplanning approval, and that it is for the Respondent and the residents to decide for\ntheir own development ifthey will allow non-residents to patronise the shop as well\n(see Annex C ofthe Applicant's Opening Submissions).\n22. The Board is of the view that the Respondent has the power pursuant to section\n29(1)(a) of the BMSMA to restrict members of the public who are not residents,\nguests ofresidents or the Applicant's staff to enter Urban Vista and accordingly, to\npatronise the commercial units in Urban Vista. The Respondent has the duty to\ncontrol and manage the usage of the common property for the benefit of all the\nsubsidiary proprietors.\n23. The Applicant submitted that Urban Vista is a mixed development with 582\nresidential units and three (3) commercial units (see Applicant's Opening\nSubmissions at paragraph 1).\n24. However, the Grant of Written Permission issued by URA stated that Urban Vista\nis a \"...condominium housing development comprising...total of 582 units...[and]\nthree (3) shops...\" (see Annex B of the Applicant's Opening Submissions at\nparagraph 4).\n25. In the course ofproceedings, the Applicant's solicitors confirmed that they agreed\nwith URA's classification of Urban Vista being a condominium housing\ndevelopment.\n26. Accordingly, the Board is ofthe view that Urban Vista is a residential development\nand not a mixed development. In a residential development, the management\ncorporation and the residents have the right to restrict the type or class of people\nentering the residential property. Hence, the Respondent has the right to restrict\nmembers of the public who are neither residents nor guests of residents from\nentenng Urban Vista.\nOrdinary resolution passed\n27. The subsidiary proprietors ofUrban Vista have passed an ordinary resolution at the\n2nd Annual General Meet'ing, resolving that the commercial units in Urban Vista\nwill be for residents'use only (see Annex F of Applicant's Opening Submissions\nat paragraph 5.0).\n28. Mr Toh Kok Seng submitted, on behalf of the Applicant, that there was a procedural\ndefect based on the current facts. Mr Toh argued that even if the Respondent had\nthe power to restrict the type or class ofpersons to enter a strata lot, it would have\n6Re side ntial dev e lopm e ntBayfront Realty Pte Ltd v\nMCST Plan No. 4404STB No. 63 of 2018 (Urban Vista)\nto be derived from a by-law properly passed and lodged with the Commissioner of\nBuildings pursuant to section 32 of the BMSMA (see paragraph 53 of the\nApplicant's Opening Submissions).\n29Notwithstanding that no by-law has been passed pursuant to section 32 of the\nBMSMA, the effect of the ordinary resolution stands as it is and remains binding\non the Applicant so long as the Applicant remains as the subsidiary proprietor of\nthe three (3) commercial units in Urban Vista.\n30. The Board is of the view that the Respondent is not being unreasonable as they have\nnever prohibited residents or guests of residents, as well as the Applicant's staff\nfrom entering Urban Vista to patronise the commercial units.\n31The Board would like to emphasise that strata developments are premised on a\nunique concept of community-based property ownership, and that it is for the\nsubsidiary proprietors to cooperate to enjoy harmonious living at their residential\nproperty (see Second Reading Speech by Second Minister for National\nDevelopment Desmond Lee, Parliament Report Vol. 94, for Building Maintenance\nand Strata Management (Amendment) Bill, 1l September 2077). The Board urges\nthe Parties to collaborate and find a beneficial arangement which would benefit the\nParties and all subsidiary proprietors.\n32. The Applicant's action is dismissed with costs. The Board will hear the Parties on\ncosts.\nDated this 22nd day of November 2018\nI\nMr Alfonso Ang\nPresident\nMr Lawrence Ang\nMember\nMr Ashvinkumar s/o Kantilal\nMember\nMr Toh Kok Seng & Mr Daniel Chan (M/s Lee & Lee) for the Applicant.\nMr Adam chong (M/s Low Yeap Toh & Goon LLp) for the Respondent.\n7x.xEc\no)o-o-\n=d\nc.).H\n\"n-s\nIatslt\nE.l\n:E\nE--v\nt$\nr\nI I\nJ!n)\n,:.tt\n--l-t_I\nI\nIJ-f\n-l!t.)I!\nIr s\n,t, ,n\"!t\nll t'\norou;"

The developer of Belysa was Pasir Ris EC Pte Ltd an d its managing agent during the \ninitial period was Knight Frank Estate Management P te Ltd (\u201cKnight Frank\u201d).  \nSometime after October 2014, the Applicants (save f or the 9 th  to 12 th  Applicants) \napproached the developer for approval to install aw nings within the private enclosed \nspace of their respective units. The developer gran ted \u201cin-principle\u201d approval for the \ninstallation of the awnings (see pages 23-25 of the  Affidavit of Evidence in Chief of \nChiz Poh Seng). All the Applicants installed fixed metal awnings within the private \nenclosed space of their respective units. These awn ings were anchored on concrete \nledges which protrude out of the external walls. So me subsidiary proprietors other than \nthe Applicants installed retractable awnings over t heir private enclosed space in their \nrespective lots. These retractable awnings are not in contention before the Board.     \n \n4.  The Applicants applied to the Board stating that th e by-law found in paragraph 5(3) of \nthe 2 nd  Schedule to Building Maintenance (Strata Managemen t) Regulations 2005 \n(\u201cBMSMR 2005\u201d) \u201cmakes clear that management corpora tions are not allowed to \nprevent subsidiary proprietors from installing safe ty devices within their own lot for the Ahmad bin Ibrahim and 21 others                                               STB No. 119 of 2017 (Bel ysa) \nv The MCST Plan No. 4131  \n4 \n improvement of safety within that lot. The shelters \u2026are specifically intended to keep \nthe Applicants and their family members safe from t he danger of \u2018killer\u2019 litter which is \nvery prevalent in the development\u201d (see page 14 of Form 8 of the Application). The \nRespondent resists the application by taking the po sition that the Applicants should \ninstall retractable awnings instead of fixed awning s. In the Respondent\u2019s closing \nsubmission, the Respondent explain that fixed awnin gs \u201ccause annoyance to the second \nfloor subsidiary proprietors as they reflect heat, block the view and are noisy when it \nrains. The fixed shelters trap dirt and are an eyes ore especially because they are not \nregularly cleaned\u201d (See The Respondent\u2019s Closing Su bmissions at [14]). \n \n   \n5.  The agreed issues before the Board are: \n \na.  Whether the manner in which the Applicants had inst alled the coverings over their \nprivate enclosed spaces constitutes exclusive use a nd enjoyment of the common \nproperty which requires a section 33 of the Buildin g Maintenance and Strata \nManagement Act (Cap 30C) (\u201cBMSMA\u201d) Resolution. \n \nb.  If so, whether the prescribed by-laws rules 5(1) to  5(5) of the BMSMR 2005 serve \nto authorise the Applicants to install and prevent the Respondent from refusing to \nallow the Applicants to install safety devices even  if such installation is mounted \non common property. \n \nc.  In the circumstances, whether the Applicants\u2019 cover ings at their private enclosed \nspaces are in fact safety devices which improve saf ety within the Applicants\u2019 lots. \n \n \n6.  The Applicants\u2019 arguments are: \n \na.  The installation of the awnings does not constitute  exclusive use of common \nproperty since the concrete ledges to which they ar e attached are not common \nproperty, and even if they are, the installation do es not constitute exclusive use and \nenjoyment of those ledges; \n \nb.  Prescribed by-laws rule 5(1) to 5(5) of the BMSMR 2 005 have been considered by \nthe Strata Titles Board, High Court and Court of Ap peal to be exceptions to \nprohibitions against installations on common proper ty; and \n \nc.  On the facts, it is clear that the Applicants face a serious, potentially fatal issue of \nkiller litter, and that the awning serve to protect  them from killer litter.  \n \n \n7.  The Respondent\u2019s arguments are: \n Ahmad bin Ibrahim and 21 others                                               STB No. 119 of 2017 (Bel ysa) \nv The MCST Plan No. 4131  \n5 \n a.  The Applicants\u2019 awnings are installed on the concre te ledges which is part of the \ndesign and external fabric of the development and t herefore common property.  \n \nb.  The Applicants\u2019 awnings are not approved or authori sed by the Respondent.  \nMotions for the fixed awnings had been rejected at the 2 nd  and 3 rd  Annual General \nMeeting. \n \nc.  As the awnings, anchored onto common property, perm anently encroach onto \ncommon property, the Applicants require a 90% resol ution to allow exclusive use \nof common property and no such resolution was obtai ned. \n \nd.  Prescribed by-law Rule 5(3) of the BMSMR 2005 permi ts the installation of \u201csafety \ndevices\u201d but under Rule 5(4), any safety device mus t still adhere to guidelines \nprescribed by the management corporation. The Respo ndent\u2019s guidelines provide \nfor the installation of retractable awnings. \n \ne.  A fixed awning does not improve safety within the l ot because the awning is not of \nan approved material and actually hazardous. Also, the Applicants already have a 2 \nmetre concrete ledge covering their private enclose d space which adequately \nprotects against litter. \n \nf.  Even if the Board considers that the awning is a sa fety device, the onus is on the \nApplicants to show that a retractable awning is an inadequate safety device and only \na fixed metal awning will improve the safety of the  occupants of the lot. The \nApplicants have not discharged this burden.  \n \n \n8.  As a preliminary matter, the Applicants argue that they are entitled to install the fixed \nawnings because the awnings are not fixed onto comm on property. In other words, the \nApplicants say that the concrete ledges which ancho r the fixed awnings are not \nconsidered to be common property as defined by sect ion 2(1) of the BMSMA. Section \n2(1) of the BMSMA provides: \n \n\u201ccommon property\u201d, subject to subsection (9), means  \u2014 \n(a)in relation to any land and building comprised or t o be comprised in a strata \ntitle plan, such part of the land and building \u2014 \n(i)  not comprised in any lot or proposed lot in that st rata title plan; \nand \n(ii) used or capable of being used or enjoyed by occupie rs of 2 or \nmore lots or proposed lots; or \n \n(b) in relation to any other land and building, such p art of the land and building \u2014\n(i)  not comprised in any non-strata lot; and Ahmad bin Ibrahim and 21 others                                               STB No. 119 of 2017 (Bel ysa) \nv The MCST Plan No. 4131  \n6 \n (ii)  used or capable of being used or enjoyed by occupiers of 2 \nor more non-strata lots within that land or buildin g; \n \n \n9.  From the definition above, \u201ccommon property\u201d consis ts of two conjunctive elements: \n(a) an area or installation that was not comprised in any lot; and (b) the area or \ninstallation was used or capable of being used or e njoyed by occupiers of two or more \nsubsidiary proprietors (see Sit Kwong Lam v Management Corporation Strata Title  \nPlan No 2645 (\u201c The Ardmore Park \u201d)  [2018] 1 SLR 790). The Applicants contend that \nthe concrete ledges are not common property because  they are entirely within the strata \narea of the respective units. Furthermore, the conc rete ledges are not used or capable of \nbeing used or enjoyed by occupiers of two or more s ubsidiary proprietors. The Board \nfinds this argument unsustainable and are of the op inion that the concrete ledges are \ncommon property. Recently, Chan Seng Onn J in Wu Chiu Lin v Management \nCorporation Strata Title Plan (\u201cThe Sunglade \u201d)  [2018] 4 SLR 975 held that common \nproperty included external walls. While counsel for  the Applicants, Mr Toh Kok Seng, \nattempted to persuade the Board that the concrete l edges may be distinguished from \nexternal walls, the Board finds this argument to be  over-refined and unconvincing. The \nconcrete ledges may be likened to the external wall s of a building. The Board is unable \nto see a distinction between these concrete ledges and external walls. In relation to the \nrequirement that common property must be used or ca pable of being used or enjoyed \nby occupiers of two or more subsidiary proprietors,  the Board is bound by the Court of \nAppeal\u2019s recent decision in The Ardmore Park [2018] 1 SLR 790 which adopted a wide \nview of the second limb of the definition of common  property. Sundaresh Menon CJ \nsaid (at [59]): \n  \nany area or installation that could affect the appe arance of a building in a strata \ndevelopment, or that was part and parcel of the fab ric of the building, could, by its \nmere presence, be \u201cenjoyed\u201d by some or even all sub sidiary proprietors of the \ndevelopment. Indeed, there was no need for the area  or installation to be physically \naccessible by the subsidiary proprietors (or any of  them) in order to be \u201cenjoyed\u201d \nby the said proprietors.  \n \n10.  The Board is of the view that the concrete ledges a re part of the common property of \nthe strata development because their mere presence render them capable of being \nenjoyed by some or even all subsidiary proprietors.  Furthermore, the Applicants have \nnot asserted that they have the responsibility to m aintain the concrete ledges. This \nfurther supports the view that all the parties have  assumed correctly that the concrete \nledges are common property. Under the BMSMA, the ma nagement corporation is \ntasked to \u201ccontrol, manage and administer the commo n property for the benefit of all \nthe subsidiary proprietors constituting the managem ent corporation\u201d (see section \n29(1)(a) of the BMSMA). Since the concrete ledges a re common property, any \nalteration would require prior written approval fro m the management corporation. This Ahmad bin Ibrahim and 21 others                                               STB No. 119 of 2017 (Bel ysa) \nv The MCST Plan No. 4131  \n7 \n is enshrined in paragraph 5(1) of the 2 nd  Schedule to BMSMR 2005 which stipulate the \nprescribed by-laws for every strata development. Pa ragraph 5(1) provides that: \n \nA subsidiary proprietor or an occupier of a lot sha ll not mark, paint, drive nails or \nscrews or the like into, or otherwise damage or def ace, any structure that forms part \nof the common property except with the prior writte n approval of the management \ncorporation. \n \n11.  In the present case, it is undisputed that the Appl icants (save for the 9 th  and 10 th  \nApplicants) signed a letter of undertaking in relat ion to the installation of awnings \nwhich provided: \n \nWe understand that this in-principle approval for t he installation work given by the \nDeveloper, M/s Pasir Ris EC Pte Ltd, is subjected t o the jurisdiction of the \nManagement at its general meetings. Upon receiving any notice from the \nManagement Council \u2026to remove the canopy/awning installed in our priva te \nenclosed spaces, we shall undertake the responsibil ity to remove the said \ncanopy/awning and incur all costs and expenses rela ting to the removal within the \nstipulated date of the notice served upon us. (emph asis added) \n \n12.  It is clear that the Applicants (save for the 9 th  and 10 th  Applicants) did not have an \nunequivocal approval of the management corporation to install the fixed awnings. At \nmost, the Applicants only had conditional approval to fix the awnings. They were well \naware at the time when they installed the awnings t hat in future the Management \nCouncil may ask them to take down the awnings. This  is supported by an email dated \n23 October 2014 from Brian Chong of Knight Frank wh o wrote to the 1 st  Applicant: \n \nThere is one very important point that I would like  to stress on is that although \nwhen (sic) every approval is granted at this point of time, the final decision will \nstill lies (sic) in the committee that will be goin g (sic) to form in the near future. If \nthey have any violent objection, legally, they coul d still have the right to request \nfor the resident to remove any unauthorised structu re with a valid reason\u2026 \n \n13.  From the email correspondence and the letter of und ertaking, it could be said that the \nApplicants (save for the 9 th  and 10 th  Applicants) took a conscious risk that they may \nhave to take down the awnings sometime in the futur e. The 9 th  and 10 th  Applicants \napplied to install a \u201ccanopy shelter for PES area\u201d.  This was understood to be the \ninstallation of retractable awnings. In fact, the 9th  Applicant informed the Respondent \nthat he was installing retractable awnings. However , the Respondent subsequently \ndiscovered that they had installed fixed awnings.   \n    \n14.  As Leow explains \u201cthe use and enjoyment of the stra ta title development is governed \nby the by-laws of the development which regulates t he conduct of subsidiary \nproprietors inter se  and between subsidiary proprietors and the managem ent Ahmad bin Ibrahim and 21 others                                               STB No. 119 of 2017 (Bel ysa) \nv The MCST Plan No. 4131  \n8 \n corporation\u201d (see Rachel Leow, \u201cMinority Protection  Doctrines: From Company Law \nand Equity to Strata Title\u201d [2011] Conv 96 at 97). Without an unequivocal written \napproval from the management corporation, the fixed  awnings are prima facie in breach \nof paragraph 5(1) of the 2 nd  Schedule to the BMSMR 2005. However, this general rule \nis qualified by paragraph 5(3) of the 2 nd  Schedule to the BMSMR 2005 which provides: \n \nThis by-law shall not prevent a subsidiary propriet or or an occupier of a lot, or a \nperson authorised by such subsidiary proprietor or occupier from installing \u2014 \n(a) any locking or other safety device  for protection of the subsidiary proprietor\u2019s \nor occupier\u2019s lot against intruders or to improve safety within that lot ;  \n(b) any screen or other device to prevent entry of ani mals or insects on the lot; \n(c) any structure or device  to prevent harm to children ; or \n(d)any device used to affix decorative items to the in ternal surfaces of walls in \nthe subsidiary proprietor\u2019s or occupier\u2019s lot. (emp hasis added) \n \n \n15.  This exception allows subsidiary proprietors to ins tall a safety device to improve safety \nwithin that lot or any structure or device in order  to prevent harm to children. The Court \nof Appeal decided in The Ardmore Park  [2018] 1 SLR 790 at [72] that alterations to \ncommon property which enhanced safety and enjoyment  within the lot or prevented \nharm to children while they were within the lot wer e an exception to the by-law \nprohibiting alteration of common property without t he prior approval of the \nmanagement corporation. In the context of the insta llation of \u201cinvisible\u201d grilles, the \nStrata Titles Board articulated the rationale of th is exception in Sujit Singh Gill v MCST \nPlan No 3466  (\u201c One-North Gateway \u201d) [2015] SGSTB 2 at [49]: \n \n\u2026the proposed installation of grilles, even if it i s an alteration on common \nproperty, is not an unreasonable request since it concerns the safety of the \nApplicant\u2019s children. The Board is of the view that  the children\u2019s safety must be \nparamount, even if the grilles may affect the appea rance of the Building or if they \nconstitute an alteration on common property\u2026 (empha sis added) \n \n16.  Two points may be gleaned from the passage above in  One-North Gateway . First, in \nthe management of any strata development, the manag ement corporation should be \nguided by the principle that children\u2019s safety must  be considered to be of paramount \nimportance. However, this principle is not an unqua lified rule. Otherwise, this might \nlead to an unmanageable situation where every subsi diary proprietor would ignore the \nmanagement corporation in relation to alterations t o common property and allege that \nthese works were for safety purposes. There must be  some logical limit to the general \nrule that a subsidiary proprietor may alter common property for the safety of residents \nand children living within his or her lot. This lea ds us to the next point which is often \noverlooked. Second, alteration of common property t o install safety devices to protect \nchildren must be a reasonable  request as mentioned by the Board in One-North Ahmad bin Ibrahim and 21 others                                               STB No. 119 of 2017 (Bel ysa) \nv The MCST Plan No. 4131  \n9 \n Gateway . We will return and develop the second point on re asonableness in our \njudgment.  \n \n17.  Therefore, for the Applicants to succeed in this ac tion they must persuade the Board on \nthe following matters: \n \na.  That the alterations to the common property to secu re the fixed awnings should \nbe construed as a safety device to improve safety o n that lot or is meant to \nprevent harm to children living in their respective  lots; and \n \nb.  The installation of fixed awnings constituted a rea sonable method to achieve \nsuch safety purposes.  \n \n18.  In this present dispute, the Board must determine w hether awnings may be considered \nto be either a \u201csafety device\u2026to improve safety wit hin that lot\u201d or a \u201cstructure or device \nto prevent harm to children\u201d as per paragraph 5(3) of 2nd  Schedule to the BMSMR 2005.  \nCounsel for the Respondent, Ms Teh Ee-von, referred  the Board to Management Corp \nStrata Title Plan No 2570 v Ng Khai Chua [2006] SGDC 176 at [47] where Malcolm \nTan Ban Hoe DJ interpreted paragraph 5(3) of the 2nd  Schedule to the BMSMR 2005 \nto cover safety features and devices \u201cwhich can eas ily be attached within the subsidiary \nunit or with minimal encroachment onto common prope rty\u201d. Tan DJ held that a covered \ntrellis does not fall within the definition of para graph 5(3) of the 2nd  Schedule to the \nBMSMR 2005. Therefore, Ms Teh argued that an awning  is not considered to be a \nsafety device that improves safety within the lot. \n \n19.  In contrast, Chan Seng Onn J in The Sunglade [2018] 4 SLR 975 at [14] mentioned that \nthe subsidiary proprietors on the ground floor unit s entered into a settlement agreement \nat a mediation before the Board on the ground inter alia  that the coverings over trellises \nconstituted the installation of safety devices for the improvement of safety within those \nstrata lots pursuant to paragraph 5(3) of the 2nd  Schedule to BMSMR 2005. While this \npoint was not argued, it seems that the Board (and indeed Chan Seng Onn J) in The \nSunglade implicitly assumed that coverings over trellises ma y be construed as safety \ndevices under paragraph 5(3) of the 2 nd  Schedule to BMSMR 2005.   \n \n20.  On balance, the Board is of the view that the term \u201csafety device\u201d referred to in \nparagraph 5(3) of the 2nd  Schedule to BMSMR 2005 is wide enough to include a n \nawning. In reaching this conclusion, the Board is m indful that the overriding objective \nof paragraph 5(3) of the 2nd  Schedule to BMSMR 2005 is to ensure the safety of the \noccupants within the subsidiary proprietor\u2019s lot. \u201c Killer\u201d litter has been known to cause \nserious injury and even death. Therefore, as a matt er of common sense, the term \u201csafety \ndevice\u201d in paragraph 5(3) of the 2 nd  Schedule to BMSMR 2005 ought to be interpreted \nbroadly to include an awning which is installed to prevent \u201ckiller\u201d litter from harming \nthe occupants of the subsidiary proprietor\u2019s lot.  \n Ahmad bin Ibrahim and 21 others                                               STB No. 119 of 2017 (Bel ysa) \nv The MCST Plan No. 4131  \n10 \n 21.  On the facts, the Board is satisfied that the prese nt strata development faces a \u201ckiller\u201d \nlitter problem. Numerous items such as a knife blad e, laundry pole, tennis racket, glass \nshards and aluminium poles have dropped into the gr ound floor units (See paragraphs \n7 \u2013 22 of the Affidavit of the 1 st  Applicant).  \n \n22.  Mr Toh argues that the \u201cquestion the Board has to d ecide is whether Applicants\u2019 \nshelters are in fact safety devices which improve s afety within the Applicants\u2019 lots. The \nexistence of alternatives does not change the answe r to the question to be decided.\u201d  \nThe Board does not accept this argument. Having dec ided that an awning may be \nconsidered as a safety device and that there was a \u201ckiller\u201d litter problem in the present \nstrata development, the next question to be decided  is whether the installation of the \nfixed metal awning was a reasonable response to the  \u201ckiller\u201d litter problem? In other \nwords, even though paragraph 5(3) of the 2 nd  Schedule to BMSMR 2005 permits \nalterations to common property to install safety de vices, these safety devices must be a \nnecessary, reasonable and proportionate  response to the problem. For example, in \nOne-North Gateway  it was a necessary, reasonable and proportionate r esponse for the \nsubsidiary proprietor to install \u201cinvisible\u201d grille s to prevent his children from leaning \nand climbing over the balcony of his unit. The inst allation of \u201cinvisible\u201d grilles is an \noption which does not detract from the appearance a nd uniformity of the building.  \nAssume that the subsidiary proprietor in One-North Gateway chose not to install \n\u201cinvisible\u201d grilles but wanted to install intricate  grilles with an ornamental design.  \nWould such grilles be permitted under paragraph 5(3 ) of the 2 nd  Schedule to BMSMR \n2005? The answer would be surely not. Such intricat e ornamental grilles would not \nconstitute a necessary, reasonable and proportionat e response to solving the safety \nproblem when another option which would not detract  from the uniformity and \nappearance of the building exists i.e. \u201cinvisible g rilles\u201d. \n \n23.  The principle that the safety devices installed sho uld be a necessary, reasonable and \nproportionate response to solving the problem may b e justified on the fact that the \nmanagement corporation in a strata development has to juggle competing demands \nfrom different subsidiary proprietors who may have conflicting interests. As Hazel \nEasthope and Bill Randolph note that owners in stra ta schemes \u201cmust make daily \nnegotiations between their individual desires and t heir responsibilities to neighbours, \ncivic interests and broader society\u201d (see Hazel Eas thope & Bill Randolph, \u201cCollective \nResponsibility in Strata Apartments in Multi-Owned Property in the Asia Pacific \nRegion (Erika Altmann & Michelle Gabriel eds) (Palgrave Ma cMillan, 2018) 177, 178). \nWhile we appreciate that the Applicants are of the view that fixed awnings would best \nprotect them and their families, we have also heard  compelling evidence from a \nsubsidiary proprietor who lives on the second floor , Mr Goh Tang Peng, on the effect \nthat a fixed awning had on his life. Mr Goh likened  the fixed awning on the first floor \nto a \u201cmetal plate\u201d which radiated heat, was noisy w hen it rained and accumulated dirt. \nThis led Mr Goh to shut his window, draw his blinds  and turn on his air conditioner all \nthe time. Mr Goh said that the fixed awnings has le d him not to be able to enjoy his \nbalcony and suffer from depression. In contrast, if  a retractable awning was installed, Ahmad bin Ibrahim and 21 others                                               STB No. 119 of 2017 (Bel ysa) \nv The MCST Plan No. 4131  \n11 \n dirt and rubbish would not accumulate on the awning  indefinitely since there would be \na natural inclination to the retractable awning.  F urthermore, Mr Goh said he could use \na broom to push the rubbish accumulating on the ret ractable awning. The rain would \neventually wash the rubbish on the retractable awni ng down to the ground. Mr Goh said \nthat the presence of the fixed awning made him feel  helpless. We narrate Mr Goh\u2019s \nevidence to demonstrate that the Respondent as the management corporation is not \nbeing unreasonable in refusing the Applicants\u2019 requ est for fixed awnings but instead is \nseeking in good faith to balance the competing inte rests of all subsidiary proprietors. \nWhile the Board appreciates the Applicants\u2019 safety concerns, the Board also has to take \ninto account Mr Goh\u2019s perspective. In analysing thi s dispute, we are reminded of Kevin \nGray\u2019s and Susan Francis Gray\u2019s wise words in their  seminal textbook, Elements of \nLand Law , (OUP, 2009) at 113 that \u201c\u2026the deep structure of \u2018 property\u2019 is not absolute \nor oppositional in nature. It is, instead, delimite d by a pervasive sense of community-\ndirected obligation and is rooted in a contextual n etwork of mutual restraint and social \naccommodation mediated by the agencies of the state .\u201d \n \n24.  In the present case, the main contention between th e Applicants and Respondent is \nchoosing between the option of a fixed metal awning  or retractable awning. Would a \nretractable awning function as a safety device to p rotect the Applicants and their \nfamilies? The Applicants dispute that a retractable  awning would serve as an adequate \nsafety device on the following grounds: (a) the inc lination of the retractable awning \nwould mean that an adult would not be able to stand  in every part of the subsidiary \nproprietor\u2019s private enclosed space due to height r estrictions. In other words, the lower \nparts of the retractable awning will not allow an a dult to stand up straight and the adult \nhas to crouch or bend down; (b) the Applicants woul d have to install multiple \nretractable awnings to cover the entire subsidiary proprietor\u2019s lot; (c) the canvas \ncovering on a retractable awning may not be able to  protect against heavier or sharper \nfalling items such as laundry poles, parasol, bag o f soil and knife plates; and (d) \nretractable awnings are not fire rated and could ea sily catch fire from cigarette butts \nthrown down.   \n \n25.  After reviewing the evidence, the Board is not pers uaded by the Applicants\u2019 position. \nThe Board is satisfied that the Respondent has prov ed that retractable awnings are a \nnecessary, reasonable and proportionate response to  the \u201ckiller\u201d litter problem. In \nparticular, the Board has been shown documentation of nine grown men sitting on a \nretractable awning (see pages 26 and 29 of the Resp ondent\u2019s Bundle of Supplementary \nDocuments). There is also evidence of such retracta ble awnings being subject to 43 kg \nand 74 kg drop tests (see page 25 of Respondent\u2019s B undle of Supplementary \nDocuments). Thus, the Applicants\u2019 argument that ret ractable awnings would not \nadequately protect them is unconvincing. Furthermor e, the Respondent has tendered \nevidence that it is possible to use incombustible/f ire-retardant materials on such \nretractable awnings (see page 32 of Respondent\u2019s Bu ndle of Supplementary \nDocuments). Therefore, the Applicants\u2019 submission t hat retractable awnings could \neasily catch fire from lighted cigarette butts is u npersuasive. Finally, the Applicants\u2019 Ahmad bin Ibrahim and 21 others                                               STB No. 119 of 2017 (Bel ysa) \nv The MCST Plan No. 4131  \n12 \n contention that inclination of the retractable awni ngs would mean that an adult would \nnot be able stand in every part of the subsidiary p roprietor\u2019s lot due to height restrictions \nought to be rejected. The issue at hand is not to f ind a perfect solution which would \nmeet the Applicants\u2019 every need. Instead, the prope r inquiry is to find a reasonable, \nnecessary and proportionate response to solve the p roblem of \u201ckiller\u201d litter.   \n       \n26.  There are two side issues that the Board would like  to deal with. First, we note Chan \nSeng Onn J in The Sunglade [2018] 4 SLR 975 held that a by-law which allowed a  \nsubsidiary proprietor to install coverings over the  roof trellises needs to be passed by a \n90% resolution. This is because the installation of  coverings over the roof trellises \ninvolved the conferring of exclusive use and enjoym ent of or special privileges \nexceeding three years in respect of common property . Section 33(1)(c) of the BMSMA \nstipulates that a 90% resolution is required to mak e by-laws conferring on subsidiary \nproprietors the exclusive use and enjoyment of or s pecial privileges in respect of the \nwhole or any part of common property exceeding thre e years. The Board regards itself \nto be bound by The Sunglade decision. Since the coverings over the roof trellis es are \nvery similar to the installation of awnings, we are  of the view that a 90% resolution is \nrequired to make the necessary by-laws authorising the awnings. On the present facts, \nwe note that a motion to approve retractable awning s was passed with 85.11% share \nvalue at the 2 nd  Annual General Meeting held on 15 October 2016 (se e page 277 of the \nAffidavit of the 1 st  Applicant). Since this motion was below 90%, the B oard has not \ntaken this factor into account in coming to its dec ision. Indeed, Chan Seng Onn J in The \nSunglade [2018] 4 SLR 975 held that a trellis by-law which r eceived 83.06% support \nat the Annual General Meeting was not validly  made. Even though there was no 90% \nresolution approving retractable awnings, the Board  is of the view that the Respondent \nis entitled to take the position that retractable a wnings instead of fixed awnings are a \nnecessary, reasonable and proportionate response to  the \u201ckiller\u201d litter problem.     \n \n27.  Mr Toh made a valiant attempt to persuade the Board  that the installation of a fixed \nawning was not an exclusive use of common property.  Relying on inter alia Platt v \nCieriello [1997] QCA 33, Mr Toh argued that: (i) exclusive us e of common property \ndoes not refer to the mere fact of exclusive posses sion; (ii) exclusive use of common \nproperty is the use of common property in a manner for a purpose which interferes \nunreasonably with the right of others to use the sa me common property; and (iii) if a \nsubsidiary proprietor uses the common property in a  manner or for a purpose which \ndoes not interfere unreasonably with the right of o thers to do likewise, there is no \nexclusive use of common property. To bolster his po sition, Mr Toh gives the following \nexamples in the Applicants\u2019 Closing Submission (at [38]): \n \n..structural beams and columns which run though str ata units may be \u2018used\u2019 in the \nsense that one might enclose them with a false ceil ing or wall, or paste wallpaper \non them, paint them, or hang items on them. Similar ly, sewage pipes which run \nthough the strata lots may also be boxed up, painte d etc. There is no reported case \nwhere the management corporation has insisted on a Section 33 BMSMA exclusive Ahmad bin Ibrahim and 21 others                                               STB No. 119 of 2017 (Bel ysa) \nv The MCST Plan No. 4131  \n13 \n use by-law at a general meeting to approve every in stance of such use for every \nsingle unit, every small shoe cabinet placed on the  common corridor outside the \nunit, every floor mat outside the door and every we lcome sign hung on the wall \nbeside the main door.   \n \n28.  Mr Toh argued forcefully that there was \u201cno content ion that other subsidiary proprietors \nhave any entitlement to use and enjoy the concrete ledges, or even that they have any \ndesire to do so\u201d (at [39]). The Board sees some for ce in Mr Toh\u2019s argument that \nexclusive use of common property is a question of f act. As Professor Douglas Harris \nperceptive notes \u201c[w]ithout common property through  which people can move freely, \nprivate property becomes unusable or inefficiently usable because of the resources \nrequired to negotiate and secure access\u2026The common property in a condominium \nperforms the same role of facilitating access to, w hile preserving the integrity of, private \nproperty\u201d (see Douglas C. Harris, \u201cCondominium and the City: The Rise of Property in \nVancouver\u201d (2011) Law & Social Inquiry 694, 701). T he key to the idea of exclusive \nuse of common property is if such use prevents othe r subsidiary proprietors from \naccessing a similar resource. Thus, in the installa tion of an awning, if the awning is \nfound to prevent the management corporation from us ing gondolas to paint the external \nwalls, then this may be considered to be a form of exclusive use of common property.  \nHowever, if it can be shown, as a matter of evidenc e, that the gondolas may still access \nthe external walls without much difficulty, then th ere is an argument that the installation \nof an awning does not constitute an exclusive use o f common property. If this \nproposition is correct, then a 90% resolution is no t needed. However, this is a tentative \nobservation as the Board is bound by Chan Seng Onn J\u2019s decision in The Sunglade \n[2018] 4 SLR 975 which unequivocally held that cove ring up trellises constituted an \nexclusive use of common property. In the Board\u2019s op inion, it is not possible to \ndistinguish the installation of an awning from the covering up of trellises in The \nSunglade . In any case, this argument would not have an impa ct on the overall result in \nthe present case since the Board has found that the  fixed awnings were not a necessary, \nreasonable and proportionate response to the \u201ckille r\u201d litter problem.  \n \n29.  In light of the above, the Board is of the view the  Respondent\u2019s position approving a \nretractable awning as a safety device instead of a fixed awning is justified. The \ninstallation of a retractable awning is a necessary , reasonable and proportionate \nresponse to the \u201ckiller\u201d litter problem. The Board appreciates that the Applicants have \ninstalled the fixed awnings in the good faith belie f that this was the best option to protect \nthemselves and their families. However, the Board m ust balance their needs with other \ncompeting demands of the rest of the subsidiary pro prietors. The Board urges all parties \nto repair and reconcile their relationship after th is application because parties are, in the \nwords of Blandy, Bright & Nield, in an \u201cenduring pr operty relationship\u201d (see Sarah \nBlandy, Susan Bright and Sarah Nield, \u201cThe Dynamics  of Enduring Property \nRelationships in Land\u201d (2018) 81 MLR 85). The Board  also urges the Respondent, \ntogether with all the subsidiary proprietors to res olve this anti-social behaviour of \nlittering. As a leading property scholar, Chen Lei,  in concluding his excellent and \ninsightful comparative study on condominium law, sa ys \u201c[t]he interplay between unit Ahmad bin Ibrahim and 21 others                                               STB No. 119 of 2017 (Bel ysa) \nv The MCST Plan No. 4131  \n14 \n owners is crucial for harmonious condominium living . People who live in \ncondominiums must out of necessity work closely wit h each other to make a \ncondominium association function\u201d (see Chen Lei, The Making of Chinese \nCondominium Law: A Comparative Perspective with Ame rican and South African \nCondominium Laws  (Intersentia, 2010), 179). This is a sentiment whi ch the Board \nwholeheartedly endorses.  \n \n30.  Therefore, the Applicants\u2019 action is dismissed with  costs. The Board will hear the \nparties on costs. \n \n31.  The Board would like to thank counsel for the Appli cants, Mr Toh, and for the \nRespondent, Ms Teh, for their depth of knowledge an d effective assistance.  \n \nDated this 12th day of November 2018 \n \n \n            _________________________ \n            Mr Alfonso Ang \n            President \n \n \n            _________________________ \n            Dr Tang Hang Wu \n            Member \n       \n       \n            _________________________ \n            Mr Chng Beng Guan \n            Member \n \n \n \n \n \n             Mr Toh Kok Seng & Daniel Chan (M/s Lee  & Lee) for the Applicants.                                                   \nMs Teh Ee-von (M/s Infinitus Law Corporation) for t he Respondent. \n "

On the 27th August 2018 at the second mediation session, the Applicants and their \ncounsel appeared. The Respondent was absent. All parties had been notified of the date \nand time of the second mediation session. As the Respondent was absent, the date and \ntime for the arbitration hearing was then fixed on the 24th September 2018 at 11.30am. \nThe Respondent was notified via registered post and courier service on the 27th August \n2018 of the hearing date and time.\n5.

AW2 (Ng Li Peng) in her AEIC stated that sometime in January 2007, she discovered \nsigns of water seepage on the walls of the bedrooms.\n8. The leaks stopped after February 2017 and so AW2 (Ng Li Peng) assumed that the \nRespondent had rectified the leakage issue.\n9. The leaks reappeared one year later in 2018 at the same places. The Respondent denied \nliability when contacted sometime in February 2018.\n10. AW2 (Ng Li Peng) engaged an expert, C.S Lee to investigate and put up a report. AW2 \n(Ng Li Peng) then filed an application to the Strata Titles Boards (\u201cSTB\u201d) seeking orders \nas stated in her application.\n11. AW3 (Lim Ah Kow) in his AEIC stated that he agreed with what AW2 had stated in her \nAEIC. He alleged that the water seepages from the Respondent\u2019s unit had found their \nway into his unit causing damages to his property. He also together with AW2 jointly \nfiled an application to the Strata Titles Boards. AW3 also alleged the loss of rental in his \nAEIC.\n12. AW1 (Lee Cheng Sung) a.k.a C.S Lee in his AEIC stated that he had been engaged by \nAW2 (Ng Li Peng) and AW3 (Lim Ah Kow) to investigate the leakage and put up a \nreport. He inspected unit #XXX  and #XXX  on the 15th August 2018 but he did not \ninspect unit #XXX  (The Respondent\u2019s unit) as he could not gain access.\n13.

In his opinion, the cause of the water seepage problems into unit #XXX  is a burst or \nleaking water supply pipe belonging to unit #XXX  above.\n15. In his opinion, the water seepage problems in unit #XXX are related to the water seepage \nproblems at unit #XXX.

Unit #XXX and #XXX originated from the \nRespondent\u2019s unit #XXX and caused damages to both the Applicants\u2019 units. BOARD\u2019S \nORDER\n17. The Board orders the Respondent to repair and rectify his unit in accordance with the \nstated recommendations of the expert in his reports within 3 weeks of this order.\n18. The Board also orders the Respondent to rectify and make good damages in unit #XXX \nand #XXX  in accordance with the recommendations stated in the expert\u2019s reports within \n2 weeks of the completion of the repair and rectification works in his own unit.\n19.

The applicant is seeking to replace a section of the common condenser water pipes that is\npart of the central chilled water air-conditioning system. The pipes pass through the\nrespondent\u2019s unit. A chiller plant at Level 36 provides chilled water to office units at levels\n18 -35. The cooling tower is at level 50 and is directly above the respondent\u2019s unit. The\nsupply/return condenser water pipes from the cooling tower to the chiller plant passes\nthrough the respondent\u2019s living room.\n3. On 17 Mar 2013 a condenser pipe ruptured (due to wear and tear). Repairs were carried\nout. (According to the applicant the applicant was allowed entry only after the applicant,\ninter alia  provided an undertaking to remove the pipes from the respondent\u2019s unit. The\nrespondent denies that entry was granted only after the applicant had acceded to her\ndemand for the pipes to be removed from her unit).  On 05 April 2013 the applicant\ncommissioned M/s 6 Sigma Pte Ltd to study the possible cause of failure of the pipes in\nthe respondent\u2019s unit and to consider preventive measures and possible diversion\nalternatives. A recommendation was made for the pipes to be replaced and to extend the\nnew pipe into the common corridor. Removal of the pipes from the respondent\u2019s unit and\nrelocating them elsewhere was not feasible.\n4. On 20 May 2013 the applicant discussed and obtained a quotation from M/s MSA\nArchitects to examine the feasibility of diverting the condenser pipes out of the\nrespondent\u2019s unit into the staircase adjacent to the unit. The study was aborted after the\nSingapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) advised that services could not be located within\nthe fire escape staircase.\n5. On 13 June 2013 the applicant\u2019s then solicitors sent a Notice of Entry for Replacement\nWork to the respondent and informed her of its intention to access her unit for repair works\non 29 June 2013. On 27 June 2013 the respondent was informed that the applicant would\nbe proceeding to carry out the repair works without fail on the 29 June 1013 at 2.00 pm.\nShe responded by sending an email stating that repair works was not necessary and\ninformed the applicant that her solicitor would be writing to the applicant shortly.\n6. The solicitors for the applicant and the respondent corresponded between July 2013 and\nDec 2013 with regard to the applicant\u2019s request for entry. The respondent refused entry.The MCST No. 461   STB No.6 of 2018 (International Plaza) \nv Lim Lay Peng (Junie) \n4 7.Following a meeting between the applicant and the respondent on 10 March 2017, a \nprofessional engineer from M/s Winstec Engineers and Associates (Winstec) was \nappointed to carry out an inspection of the condenser pipes.\n8.In addition to the existing condenser pipes Winstec found abandoned pipes and abandoned \npipes/conduit in the ceiling of the respondent\u2019s unit. The condenser water supply (CWS) \npipe had been replaced previously and the condenser water return (CWR) pipe had been \nrepaired and re-patched. Winstec\u2019s conclusion and recommendations after inspection were \ninter alia as follows:\n\u2026there is no leaking from the condenser water pipes in #XXX at this point of time. \nHowever we would like to highlight that the pipes have been around for over 40 years. The \npipe material may have weakened/corroded throughout the years. There is a high \npossibility that these pipes may start leaking soon.\nIn #XXX we observed that water is leaking from the abandoned conduit pipes\u2019 \njoints\u2026Furthermore the abandoned pipes/conduits above the false ceiling are also not in \ngood condition and there are insufficient brackets supporting the abandoned pipes. These \nabandoned services may cause safety issues and even result in more severe water leakage\novertime\u2026. \nThus we recommend\u2026 \nUnit #XXX \ni. Replacement of the existing CWS/CWR pipes and elbows with new galvanised steel\npipes and elbows\nii. Removing all the abandoned pipes and conduits\niii. After replacement works, visual inspections to be conducted annually on the\nCWS/CWR pipes\u2019 condition\n9. The application in this case was filed on 11 January 2018 and is for an order to enter the \nrespondent\u2019s  unit to carry  out works  recommended  by Winstec  on the basis  that there  is \nsignificant  risk that the pipe  may  rupture  and cause  substantial  loss  and damage  to the \napplicant and the other subsidiary proprietors of the development. However as a result of the \nrespondent\u2019s persistent refusal to grant the applicant access to unit #XXX to carry out the \nreplacement works, the applicant had no choice but to commence the present\nproceedings\u2026. \n10. In the respondent\u2019s submission (Form 18A) the respondent narrated the reasons for her\nrefusal. Other than to set out that the respondent wanted the applicant to install new pipes\nin the common area (the respondent had previously engaged M/s Airelated Services Pte\nLtd to submit a report in connection with diverting the pipes out of her unit into the\ncommon area and three options were proposed) rather than replace the pipes in her unit,\nthat since 1991 there had been  numerous incidents of water leakage and she had up to 2013\nalways granted the applicant access to carry out repairs and that after the repairs were\ncarried out the applicant did not make good the damage that was caused, it will not be\nnecessary to set out all that she narrated.The MCST No. 461                   STB No.6 of 2018  (International Plaza) \nv Lim Lay Peng (Junie) \n \n \n5 \n 11.  Following the filing of the application in this cas e parties appeared before the Board for \nmediation on 28 February 2018 and at the mediation it was agreed that the applicant would \nengage a professional engineer to conduct a feasibi lity study for the diversion of the water \nsupply and condenser water pipes in the respondent\u2019 s unit, out of her unit. The professional \nengineer appointed was Winstec and the conclusion w as that it was feasible to shift the \nmain condenser pipes out from the respondent\u2019s unit  and divert them into the common \nareas. SCDF approval was required and approval was granted on 09 May 2018.  \n \n12.  The estimated cost for relocating the pipes out of the respondent\u2019s unit into the common \narea is $50,000 ($45,900+$4100). The estimated cost  for replacing the pipes inside the \nrespondent\u2019s unit is $35,000 ($30,500+$4500) i.e. a difference of approximately $15000. \n(ABOD annex 22). \n \n13.  The applicant has since decided to proceed with the  application in this case because at an \nextraordinary general meeting on 07 Jul 2018 a reso lution for the pipes to be diverted out \nof the respondent\u2019s unit was defeated. \n \n14.  When parties appeared for directions before the dat e for hearing was fixed, it was indicated \nto the applicant. \n \nTo detail the exact order that the applicant wants the Board to issue i.e. include provisions \nwith regard to rectification of any damage caused; and compensation to the respondent \nduring the period when the respondent is denied usa ge and access of the premises when \nwork is being carried out\u2026  \nThe applicant has in the Written Submissions set ou t the order it is seeking. The order \nsought is the same as when the application was file d. While the applicant has in its written \nsubmissions informed that notice of at least 14 day s will be given to the respondent prior \nto entry, the applicant has declined to set out in detail the exact duration for which access \nis required, and the scope and method of works that  will be carried out thereto.   \n15.  Accordingly, the applicant is seeking an order from  the Board to enter into the respondent\u2019s \npremises to carry out repair and replacement works and to periodically enter the unit for \npurposes of inspection. There is no mention as to h ow much notice is to be given, no \nmention as to the number of entries required and no  mention of the scope and duration of \nthe works. There are no proposals regarding damages  caused by the works to the unit and \npayment of any compensation to the respondent when she is unable to use her unit. The \napplicant\u2019s position is that the respondent should not be compensated  for any access . \n \n \nAPPLICANT\u2019S CASE \n \n16.  When the application was filed, it was set out in t he application form that the orders were \nsought under sections 101(1)(c) and 114 of the Buil ding Maintenance and Strata \nManagement Act Cap 30C (the Act). In the written su bmissions the applicant has submitted \nthat the orders can be made under sections 101(1)(a ), 101(1)(c) and 114 of the Act. Under \nsection 101(1)(a) it was submitted that the state of the pipe  constitute a defect  and the \nBoard would have the jurisdiction  to make the orders  sought. Under section 101(1)(c) it \nwas submitted that there was a dispute with respect  to the applicant\u2019s duty under section \n29(1) of the Act which clearly extends to keeping t he pipes in a state of good and The MCST No. 461                   STB No.6 of 2018  (International Plaza) \nv Lim Lay Peng (Junie) \n \n \n6 \n serviceable repair . Under section 114 it was submitted that the Board  could make the \norders sought under section 114 read together with section 30(2)( c) and/or section 30(5) \nof the Act.  \n \nRESPONDENTS\u2019 CASE \n \n17.  The written submissions were in line with the submi ssion in Form 18A. \n \nBOARD\u2019S DECISION \n \n18.  Under the three sections referred to by the applica nt the Board would have a discretion \nwhether or not to make orders applied for when the relevant conditions for the making of \nthe orders have been met i.e. when the relevant conditions for the making of the orders \nhave been met, the Board can decide if the order ap plied for should be granted or decide \nthat it should not be granted if there are valid re asons for refusing \n \n19.  It will be appropriate that the Board should first consider section 114. \n \n114.\u2014(1) A Board may make an order requiring a subs idiary proprietor or an occupier of \nany lot or part of a lot to allow a management corp oration or subsidiary management \ncorporation, as the case may be, access to the lot or part of the lot for the purpose of \ncarrying out any work referred to in section 30 or determining whether any such work \nneeds to be carried out. \n \n(2) This section shall not limit the power of any m anagement corporation or subsidiary \nmanagement corporation to enter a lot under section  31 without applying for an order \nunder this section. \n \n(3) An application under this section may be made o nly by a management corporation or \nsubsidiary management corporation.  \n \n20.  Under section 114 (1) of the Act a Board can make a n order allowing for the management \ncorporation to enter/access a subsidiary proprietor \u2019s lot in the circumstances spelt out in \nthe section. The circumstances are \n \n\u2026for the purpose of carrying out work under section  30 or determining whether such work \nneeds to be carried out  \n \n21.  Section 114(2) informs that in addition to section 114(1) there is another section in the Act \nviz section 31 that provides for entry by a managem ent corporation into a lot. \n \n22.  Accordingly, it can be noted that there are two sec tions in the Act that provides for a \nmanagement corporation to enter a subsidiary propri etor\u2019s lot. Whilst an order for entry \nfrom the Board is required under section 114, there  is no requirement for the management \ncorporation to make an application to the Board for  an order for entry when entry is sought \npursuant to powers provided under section 31 of the  Act.  \n \n23.  Section 30 of the Act is as follows \n The MCST No. 461                   STB No.6 of 2018  (International Plaza) \nv Lim Lay Peng (Junie) \n \n \n7 \n 30.\u2014(1) Where a notice has been served on the subsi diary proprietor of a lot by a public \nauthority requiring that subsidiary proprietor to c arry out any work on or in relation to \nthat lot and the notice is not complied with, the m anagement corporation may carry out \nthe work. \n \n(2) Where a subsidiary proprietor, mortgagee in pos session, lessee or occupier of a lot \nfails or neglects to carry out any work \u2014 \n \n(a) required to be carried out by him under a term or condition of a by-law referred to in \nsection 33; \n \n(b) necessary to remedy a breach of the duty impose d on him by section 63(a); \n \n(c) to rectify any defect in any water pipe or sewe r pipe within his lot or any cracks in the \nwall or floor within his lot; or \n(d) necessary to rectify his contravention of secti on 37(1), the management corporation \nmay carry out that work. \n \n(3) Where the management corporation carries out an y work on or in relation to a lot or \ncommon property under subsection (1) or (2), it may  recover the cost of so doing, as a debt \n\u2014 \n \n (a) from the subsidiary proprietor, mortgagee in p ossession, lessee or occupier referred \n to  in subsection (1) or (2); or \n \n (b) where the work is carried out \u2014 \n \n (i) under subsection (1) or (2)(b) or (c), from an y person who, after the work is carried \n out,becomes the subsidiary proprietor of the lot o n or in relation to which the work was \n carried out; or \n \n(ii) under subsection (2)(a), from any person who, after the work is carried out, becomes \nthe subsidiary proprietor of the lot in respect of which the by-law referred to in subsection \n(2)(a) was made. \n \n(4) Where an order (including an interim order) mad e by any Board has not been complied \nwith, the management corporation may carry out any work specified in the order and \nrecover from the person against whom the order was made the cost of so doing as a debt \nin a court of competent jurisdiction. \n \n(5) Where \u2014 \n \n(a) any part of a building comprised in a lot conta ins any structural defect which affects \nor is likely to affect the support or shelter provi ded by that lot for another lot in that \nbuilding or the common property; or The MCST No. 461                   STB No.6 of 2018  (International Plaza) \nv Lim Lay Peng (Junie) \n \n \n8 \n (b) any defect occurs in any pipe, wire, cable or d uct referred to in section 63(a)(ii) within \na lot, and the defect is not due to any breach of t he duty imposed on any person by section \n63(a), the management corporation shall carry out s uch work as is necessary to rectify the \ndefect and may recover the cost of such work from a ny person who has a duty to remedy \nthe defect as a debt in any court of competent juri sdiction. \n \n(6) Where \u2014 \n \n(a) the management corporation incurs any expenditu re or performs any repairs, works or \nacts that it is required or authorised by this Part  or by any other written law to perform \n(whether or not the expenditure was incurred or the  repairs, works or acts were performed \nconsequent upon the service on it by the Government  or any statutory authority of any \nnotice or order); and \n \n(b) the expenditure or the repairs, works or acts w ere rendered necessary by reason of any \nwilful or negligent act or omission on the part of,  or breach of any provision of its bylaws \nby any person or his tenant, lessee, licensee or in vitee, the amount of that expenditure \nexpended by it in performing the repairs, works or acts shall be recoverable by it from that \nperson as a debt in an action in any court of compe tent jurisdiction. \n \n24.  The section deals with various types of work descri bed in subsections (1), (2) and (4) and \n(5) viz    \n Section 30(1) - work that a public authority requi res a subsidiary proprietor to be carry \nout;       \nSection 30(2) \u2013 (a) work that a subsidiary propriet or is required to carry out under  a term \nor condition of a by-law where exclusive use of com mon property or special privileges in \nrespect of common property has been conferred; (b) work that a subsidiary proprietor is \nrequired to carry out in order to remedy a breach o f a duty imposed by section 63(a) of the \nAct i.e. acts done by a subsidiary proprietor that has affected other subsidiary proprietors \nor common property; (c) work that a subsidiary prop rietor is required to carry out in order \nto rectify any defect in any water pipe or sewer pi pe within a subsidiary proprietor\u2019s lot (d) \nwork that a subsidiary proprietor is required to ca rry out to rectify a contravention of \nsection 37 of the Act i.e. an improvement in the lo t that has increased the floor area of the \nland; \n \n      Section 30(4) - work that a Board has ordered ;   \nSection 30(5) - work necessary to rectify structura l defects in a part of the building or \ndefects in pipes, wires, cables or ducts referred t o in section 63(a)(ii). \n \n25.  The applicant has applied for orders in connection with two (2) sets of pipes viz \n \na.  Replacement of existing Condenser Water Supply/Cond enser Water Return pipes and \nelbows with new galvanised steel pipes and elbows \nb.  Removal of all abandoned pipes and conduits; and  \n The MCST No. 461   STB No.6 of 2018 (International Plaza) \nv Lim Lay Peng (Junie) \n9 26.With regard to the existing Condenser Water Supply/Condenser Water Return pipes and \nelbows the work that the applicant is seeking to carry out is work that is referred to in \nsection 30(5). It is not work that is referred to in sections 30(1), 30(2), or 30(4)\n27.Under section 114 of the Act read with section 30(5) an order can be made in connection \nwith the existing Condenser Water Supply/Condenser Water Return pipes if the Board is \nsatisfied that the pipes are defective and replacement of the pipes is necessary.\n28.The applicant is seeking for an order for entry to replace the pipes which were repaired in \nMarch 2013 and its current condition according to Winstec is\n\u2026there is no leaking from the condenser water pipes in #XXX  at this point of time. \nHowever we would like to highlight that the pipes have been around for over 40 years. The \npipe material may have weakened/corroded throughout the years. There is a high \npossibility that these pipes may start leaking soon.\n29.Whilst the pipes may have been around for over 40 years and the pipe material may have \nweakened/corroded and there is a high possibility that they may start leaking soon the \nBoard is not satisfied that replacement of the pipes can qualify as works necessary to rectify \nany defect in any water pipe.\n30.In Re Himiko Court (Strata Titles Plan No 945) [1992] SGSTB 3 the Board when deciding \nwhether it had jurisdiction with regard to an application for an order in connection with \nnoise emanating from the squash courts was a \u201cdefect\u201d within the meaning of section 101 \n(then section 103) of the Act decided that it was not. At page 4/5 of the Grounds of Decision \nthe Board said\nIn our opinion, the Respondent's case clearly falls within the first limb of Section 103. The \nword \"defects\" is defined in Stroud's Judicial Dictionary to mean \"the lack or absence of \nsomething essential to completeness\u201d.\nThe Concise Oxford Dictionary defines the word \"defects\" to mean \"lack of something \nessential or required; imperfection\".\nIn Barry v. Minturn (1913) AC at page 589 Lord Parker of waddington said \"..... In \nconsidering whether a party structure is defective, the proper course is, in my opinion, to \nconsider how far it is effective for the purpose for which it is used or intended to be used \nand not to compare its various characteristics with those of an imaginary structure perfect \nfor all purposes.\" \nThus, in order for the Respondent to succeed, the alleged excessive noise level must render \nthe squash court facilities ineffective to be used for the purpose for which they were \nintended to (ie., to play squash). \n31. The pipes in this case are not ineffective for the purpose for which they are used and the\nBoard is not satisfied that they are defective.The MCST No. 461   STB No.6 of 2018 (International Plaza) \nv Lim Lay Peng (Junie) \n10 32. Even if the pipes can be classified as defective, the Board has not been persuaded that\nreplacement works are necessary as replacement is not the only option available to the\napplicant. Accordingly, an order cannot be made under section 114 read with section 30(5)\nof the Act.\n33. Even though replacement of the pipes may not qualify as works necessary to rectify a\ndefect the Board considered whether an order should be made on the basis that an order\ncan be made under section 114 read with section 30(5) of the Act.\n34. Whilst the applicant had at the hearing and in its written submissions informed that it was\nprepared to provide an undertaking that work would be carried out with minimal\ninconvenience to the respondent there is, in the order applied for  no indication of the\nnumber of days and/or hours required for the work to be done. Within 30 days of an order\nbeing made the applicant can at any time of the day or night require access and respondent\nwill have to open her door and remain in the premises for the entire period of the work or\ninspection. It is probable that damage would be caused to the respondent\u2019s unit when\nreplacement works are being carried out and no proposals have been made in connection\nwith rectification. In the event that the respondent will have to vacate the unit when work\nis being carried out, she will have to find alternative accommodation and/or find a place to\npass the time at her own expense.\n35. Other than the abandoned pipes in the respondent\u2019s unit the Board considered the fact that\nin this case works in connection with the pipes can be rectified without the need for entry\nand periodic inspection in the respondent\u2019s unit. Even though a motion to divert the pipes\nwas defeated at a meeting of the applicant\u2019s, diversion into the common areas is an available\noption. The Board is also of the view that considering the need for general maintenance and\nrepairs and accessibility in the event of an emergency it is preferable that fixtures and\nfittings including pipes that are not used exclusively for the enjoyment of a subsidiary\nproprietor\u2019s unit should not be located within the unit. [The Board notes that in the\nrespondent\u2019s submissions, there was a major leakage in December 2005 where the applicant\nwas not able to or otherwise did not access the respondent\u2019s unit for 2 days after a leak\noccurred].\n36. When the application was filed it was on the basis that diversion was not a feasible option.\nIn the course of mediation it was determined that diversion is a feasible option and the\napplicant is now submitting that it cannot proceed with this option because i) a 90%\nresolution is required under section 34 of the Act because it would amount to an\nabandonment of an easement resulting in a disposal of land; and ii) a special resolution is\nrequired under section 29(1)(d) because it would result in an improvement of the common\nproperty.\n37. The Board is not satisfied and does not agree that sections 34 and 29(1)(d) are applicable.\nDiversion of pipes cannot amount to disposal of land. In any event, if the pipes were\ndiverted there would be no actual, tangible loss to the subsidiary proprietors as they would\ncontinue to enjoy the use of the pipes albeit situated in a different location.The Board is\nalso of the view that whilst the diversion of the pipes will facilitate maintenance and repairs\nit is not an improvement to common property that can only be carried out only after a\nspecial resolution has been passed. It can qualify as a renewal or replacement of a fixtureThe MCST No. 461   STB No.6 of 2018 (International Plaza) \nv Lim Lay Peng (Junie) \n11 or fitting under section 29(1(1)(b)(ii) and (iii) of the Act which can be carried out without \nthe need for a special resolution.  \n38. Even if a 90% resolution and a special resolution is required the Board is of the view that\nit is not obliged to grant the orders applied for just because the applicant is unable to secure\nthe required resolutions.\n39. Balancing the needs and concerns, including the property rights of the respondent and the\napplicant the Board considers that it will be appropriate that the order for entry for\nreplacement of the pipes should not be made under section 114 read with section 30(5) of\nthe Act.\n40. It will be in order to note that the disapproval of the application by the Board will not\nprevent the applicant from entering into the respondent\u2019s unit pursuant to its powers under\nsection 31 of the Act. In fact the applicant had previously attempted to exercise its powers\nunder this section and brought a private summons against the respondent in the State Courts\n(Magistrates Courts Summons No 195 of 2014) for obstructing and otherwise hindering it\nin the exercise of its powers of entry. The respondent was acquitted when the court found\nthat the applicant had failed to give notice in compliance with section 31(1)(d)(ii) of the\nAct.\n41. The Board is also of the view that the orders applied for cannot be made under sections\n101(1)(a) and 101(1)(c) of the Act. It is provided in section 101(7) of the Act that an order\nin respect of any matter dealt with in any other section in this Part shall not be made under\nthis section i.e a Board cannot make an order under section 101 when the subject matter in\nconnection with the order (in this case, an order requiring a subsidiary proprietor to allow\nthe management corporation access into the subsidiary proprietors lot) is dealt with in\nanother section (viz section 114) in Part VI of the Act.\n42. Even if the orders sought could be made under sections 101(1)(a) or 101(1)(c) the Board\nwould not make the orders. The reasons for not making the orders under section 114 of the\nAct would be applicable.\n43. In addition to the application for entry to replace the existing condenser pipes the applicant\nhas also applied for an order for entry to remove the abandoned pipes in the respondent\u2019s\nunit. These pipes were abandoned when the chilled water air-conditioning system serving\nthe residential units were terminated sometime in 2006 i.e. the applicant did not after the\ntermination remove the pipes from the respondent\u2019s unit. In view of the condition as\ndescribed by Winstec, it will be in order to find that these pipes are defective and that if\nthey are not removed the respondent may suffer damage and injury. Accordingly the Board\nis of the view that it is necessary that the pipes should be removed.\n44. The respondent has not in her submissions set out any reason for refusing entry for the\npurpose of removal of the abandoned pipes and the Board is of the view that it will be\nappropriate that the following order be made in connection with the abandoned pipes.\nThe respondent allows the applicant and/or its agents, representatives, or contractors \naccess to her unit at 10 Anson Road #XXX International Plaza Singapore 079903 within The MCST No. 461                   STB No.6 of 2018  (International Plaza) \nv Lim Lay Peng (Junie) \n \n \n12 \n 30 days from the date of the order to be made herei n for the purposes of carrying out the \nfollowing works  \n \nRemoval of all abandoned pipes and conduits; and al l incidental and necessary works to \ncarry out the works \n \nUnless there are valid reasons why the works cannot  be completed in the course of one \nworking day, only one entry is permitted.  \nThe applicant shall be allowed entry only between t he hours of 8.00am to 6.00pm and \nbefore entry give at least fourteen (14) days\u2019 noti ce of the date and time of entry \n \nThe applicant shall also before commencement of any  work give a written undertaking that \nany damage caused will be repaired and the premises  will be restored to its original \ncondition after the works are completed \n \n45.  It will be appropriate that no order be made for co sts. \n \n \nDated this 27th day of September 2018 \n \n            _________________________ \n            MR REMEDIOS F G  \n            Deputy President \n \n \n            _________________________ \n            MS VICKI LOH \n            Member \n       \n       \n            _________________________ \n            MR LIM PENG HONG \n            Member \n \n \n \n \n \n                        Mr Justin Chia (M/s Evershe ds Harry Elias) for the Applicant.                              \n  Junie Lim Lay Peng (in person).

This is an application by a subsidiary proprietor o f the development known as Wing \nYip Building against the management corporation for  the following order to be made \nby the Board: \n \nAn order to invalidate resolutions passed at the Re spondents Annual General Meetings \nsince 2008 (ie from the Respondent\u2019s 37 AGM held on  31 April 2008) which imposed \nmonthly maintenance charges on the Applicant.  \n \nBackground : \n \n2.  The development is a five (5) storied building with  five units. Each of the five units \noccupies one entire floor of the building. The five  units are owned by three subsidiary \nproprietors. The top three floors are owned by one subsidiary proprietor and the ground \nand second floors are owned by two different subsid iary proprietors. Hiap Seng Press (Pte) Ltd                      STB No.41  of 2018 (Wing Yip Building) \nv The MCST No. 246 \n \n3 \n  \n3.  Hiap Seng Press (Pte) Ltd (the applicant) is the ow ner of the ground floor. Kai Lim \nBuilders Merchants Pte Ltd (Kai Lim) is the owner o f the top three floors and Yoon \nLoong Enterprise Pte Ltd is the owner of the second  floor. \n \n4.  In Section E of the application form (Form 8) the a pplicant informed that every 6 years \nor so, a letter of demand would be issued by the so licitors of the respondent demanding \nfor payment of arrears of maintenance fees ($550 pe r month). There would be a very \nshort deadline for payment and a threat of criminal  sanctions under section 40(1) of the \nBuilding Maintenance and Strata Management Act Cap 30C (the Act) and a threat of \nlegal proceedings. Proceedings have since been comm enced in the State Courts by the \nrespondent in DC Suit No 3197 of 2014. \n \n5.  The applicant alleges that except for the extraordi nary general meeting held on 28 \nSeptember 2012 the only attendees at all general me etings of the respondent from 2007 \nto 2013 were Kai Lim and the managing agent. On the  basis of moneys owing to the \nrespondent, the applicant contends that at the time  of the annual general meeting in \n2009 there were subsidiary proprietors who were in arrears of maintenance \ncontributions and by virtue of paragraph 2 of the F irst Schedule of the Act, they were \nprohibited from voting at the meeting. Because Kai Lim (other than the managing \nagent) was the only attendee at the meeting a vote in connection with the passing of \nresolutions in connection with maintenance contribu tions would be invalid if Kai Lim \nwas at that point of time owing contributions due t o the respondent.  \n \n6.  The respondent objected to the application and info rmed that since 1 April 2007 the \napplicant has refused to pay maintenance contributi ons. The amount of the monthly \nmaintenance \n contribution  viz $550 was determined at annual general meetings  and \nextra ordinary general meetings in 2007, 2008, 2009 , 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013. The \nagendas for the meetings included the determination  of maintenance contributions \npayable by registered proprietors and when there wa s no objection to the agenda by any \nof the subsidiary proprietors in attendance a vote was not taken and a resolution \naffirming the agenda was deemed passed. The minutes  of the meetings were sent to the \napplicant and all subsidiary proprietors. Before Ap ril 2007 the applicant was in arrears \nof maintenance contributions for the period April 2 002 to March 2007. A demand was \nmade via lawyers for payment of the arrears and pay ment was made on or about 17 \nMay 2007 after the respondent commenced legal proce edings (MC 9114/2007) in the \nState Courts. After the payment, the applicant cont inued to default in making \nmaintenance contributions and letters of demand for  payment were sent by the \nrespondent. On 15 Dec 2008 and 29 Aug 2014 the appl icant acknowledged its debts. \nNo payments were however made and legal proceedings  for the outstanding amount \nwere commenced in DC Suit 3197 of 2014. \n Hiap Seng Press (Pte) Ltd                      STB No.41  of 2018 (Wing Yip Building) \nv The MCST No. 246 \n \n4 \n 7.  It is not in dispute that all subsidiary proprietor s including the applicant \u201c\u2026were owing \narrears to the respondent for the period 2008 to 20 13\u2026\u201d  It is the case for the \nrespondent that at the meetings between 2007 and 20 13 no votes were taken as there \nwere no objections to the agenda and the resolution s affirming the agenda were deemed \npassed. Accordingly, the resolutions could not be i nvalidated under section 103 of the \nAct on the ground that a subsidiary proprietor owin g arrears had voted in favour of the \nresolution. In connection with arrears owed to the respondent, the respondent at \nparagraph 6 (page 15) of its Submission by the Resp ondent - Form 18A informed that \nbetween 2009 and 1012 the managing agent refused to  act for the respondent due to \nnon-cooperation by all the subsidiary proprietors i ncluding the applicant and Kai Lim \nand the maintenance arrears payable by all the subs idiary proprietors had ballooned.  \n \n8.  Mediation was not successful and the dispute was fi xed for an arbitration hearing and \nWritten Submissions were filed. \n \nApplicant\u2019s Submission : \n \n9.  The applicant\u2019s written submissions were in line wi th what was set out in Section E of \nForm 8. Additionally, the applicant referred to the  respondent\u2019s admission that no votes \nwere taken at the meetings and submitted that on th is admission alone the resolutions \nshould be invalidated. \n \n10.  At paragraph 24 of its Written Submissions the appl icant submitted: \n \nIn this case if Kai Lim was not allowed to vote, th e maintenance resolutions would not \nhave passed. Hiap Seng is now being sued in the DC Suit because of the maintenance \nresolutions. Surely Hiap Seng has suffered prejudic e \n \n11.  Accordingly, the submission is that if paragraph 2 of the First Schedule of the Act had \nbeen complied with the resolution in relation to th e amount of the maintenance \ncontribution would not have been passed and because  it was passed via non-compliance \nof paragraph 2 of the First Schedule of the Act the  applicant had, because it was sued \nin DC 3170 of 2014 suffered prejudice. \n \nRespondent\u2019s Written Submissions: \n \n12.  Under section 103 of the Act the Board has a discre tion to invalidate resolutions that \nare passed in non-compliance of the Act. It will ho wever not have a discretion when \nprejudice has been caused and compliance would have  affected the result of the \nresolution. It was the submission of the respondent  that in this case no prejudice was \nsuffered by the applicant and compliance would not have affected the result.  \n Hiap Seng Press (Pte) Ltd                      STB No.41  of 2018 (Wing Yip Building) \nv The MCST No. 246 \n \n5 \n 13.  It was also submitted that invalidation would be fu tile because this would result in the \nconvening of another general meeting where the reso lutions would be reinstated by the \nattending subsidiary proprietors who are now not in  arrears. Invalidation would require \nthat moneys collected be refunded with the MCST hav ing no funds for maintenance. \n \n14.  There is a statutory requirement for subsidiary pro prietors to pay maintenance \ncontributions and any procedural defect in connecti on with the passing of the resolution \nin connection with the amount of contribution will not remove the statutory \nrequirement. It was submitted that no prejudice was  suffered by applicant and the \npassing of the resolution with regard to the amount  of contribution \u2026is merely a \nformality to put the contribution sum payable down in writing. The contribution ($550 \nper month) was not unreasonable or excessive and it  has not been raised since 2002. \n \nDecision: \n \n15.  The applicant is in this case relying on section 10 3 of the Act for the Board to make the \norder that it has prayed for. Under section 103 a r esolution passed at a meeting of a \nmanagement corporation can be invalidated by the Bo ard when the Board considers \nthat provisions of the Act in relation to a meeting  have not been complied with. It is not \nprovided that the Board must invalidate the resolut ion when provisions of the Act have \nnot been complied with. It is clear that a Board ha s been given a discretion to invalidate \nor not to invalidate when the provisions of the Act  in connection with meetings have \nnot been complied with. However, there is no discre tion  only when  failure to comply \nhas prejudicially affected another and  compliance would have resulted in a failure to \npass the resolution or affect the result of an elec tion. \n16. As noted earlier the applicant is applying for orders in connection with events that \noccurred ten (10) years ago and even though section  103 allows for a subsidiary \nproprietor to apply to invalidate any resolution in  relation to a meeting of the \nmanagement corporation, without defining how far ba ck it applies, the Board is of the \nview that it cannot have been envisaged that it app lies to a meeting held up to 10 years \nago. Such applications can cause uncertainty and ch aos in the management of strata \nproperties, especially where the subsidiary proprie tor has full knowledge of what he is \nunhappy with and could have applied under section 1 03 at the relevant time. Such a \nsubsidiary proprietor can be said to have waived an d/or acquiesced to the resolution \ncomplained of after such a period of time, and be g uilty of laches/inordinate delay in \ntaking the application 10 years too late. \n17. There is also, in this case no dispute that the  applicant has not paid and is in arrears of \nmaintenance contributions since 2008 and under sect ion 116 (d) of the Act it is within \nthe power of the Board to dismiss the application a nd whilst it was the view of the \nBoard that it would be in order to, in all of the c ircumstances of this case so dismiss the \napplication, the Board considered that it would be appropriate that we should deal with \nthe merits of the application. Hiap Seng Press (Pte) Ltd                      STB No.41  of 2018 (Wing Yip Building) \nv The MCST No. 246 \n \n6 \n 18. It was the submission of the applicant that the  Board did not have a discretion in this \ncase and was obliged to invalidate the resolutions because there was non-compliance \nwith the provisions of the Act when they were passe d and the applicant had suffered \nprejudice when they were passed. \n19. By virtue of sections 39(1) and 39(2) of the Ac t a management  corporation  is duty \nbound to determine the amounts that are reasonable and necessary for the purpose of \nmeeting actual and expected liabilities incurred or  to be incurred within a twelve months \nperiod and raise the amounts by way of contribution s from the subsidiary proprietors. \nThe amounts are to be determined from time to time at a general meeting.  After the \namounts have been determined it can be levied on th e subsidiary proprietors by way of \na notice in writing (section 40(1) of the Act) and the amount will be due and payable to \nthe management corporation.  \n20. It is provided in section 40(8) of the Act that  the contribution levied is deemed to be \nmoney payable under a contract for the provision of  services and under section 40(10) \nof the Act it will be an offence that is punishable  with a fine of $10000 if a subsidiary \nproprietor fails to pay the contribution within 14 days of a written demand made under \nsection 40(9) of the Act.  \n21. Sections 39(1) and 39(2) are as follows: \n39. \u2014 (1) The management corporation shall, from ti me to time at a general meeting, \ndetermine the amounts which are reasonable and nece ssary to be raised by \ncontributions for the purpose of meeting its actual  or expected liabilities incurred or to \nbe incurred within the period (not exceeding 12 mon ths) specified in the determination \nin respect of \u2014 \n \n(a)  the regular maintenance and keeping in good and ser viceable repair \npursuant to section 29 of parts of the parcel being  the common property, \nfixtures, fittings and other property (including mo vable property) held by \nor on behalf of the management corporation; \n(b)  the common expenses of the management corporation ( except those in \nsubsection (2)(a) to (d)); \n(c)  the payment of insurance premiums; and \n(d)  all other liabilities incurred or to be incurr ed during that period by or on \n behalf of the management corporation in carrying o ut its powers, \n authorities, duties and functions under this Act o ther than liabilities \n referred to in subsection (2). \n \n(2) The management corporation shall, also from tim e to time at a general \nmeeting, determine the amounts which are reasonable  and necessary to be raised by \ncontributions for the purpose of meeting its actual  or expected liabilities incurred or to \nbe incurred in respect of\u2014 Hiap Seng Press (Pte) Ltd                      STB No.41  of 2018 (Wing Yip Building) \nv The MCST No. 246 \n \n7 \n (a)  painting or treating of any part of the common prop erty which is a \n structure or other improvement for the preservatio n and appearance of the \n common property; \n(b)  major repairs and improvements to, and maintenance of, the common \nproperty and boundary wall; \n(c)  the renewal or replacement pursuant to section 29 o f parts of the parcel \nbeing the common property, fixtures, fittings and o ther property (including \nmovable property) held by or on behalf of the manag ement corporation; \n(d)  the acquisition of movable property; \n(da) any non-lot acquisition related expenses of th e management corporation; \n and \n(e)  such other liabilities expected to be incurred  at a future time where the \n management corporation determines in a general mee ting that the whole \n or  part thereof should be met from its sinking fu nd. \n \n22. It is not in the two sub-sections prescribed ho w the management corporation is required \nto perform its duty to determine the amount of the contributions unlike other provisions \nin the Act where the manner as to how a power, duty  or function is to be exercised or \nperformed is prescribed e.g. under section 33 of the Act a management corporatio n can, \nmake a by-law conferring upon a subsidiary propriet or the exclusive use and enjoyment \nor grant special privileges in respect of the whole  or any part of the common property \nby way of, depending on the period of exclusive use  and enjoyment, an ordinary, special \nor 90% resolution; and under section 29 (1)(d) of t he Act a management corporation \nmust install and provide additional facilities or m ake improvements to the common \nproperty when directed by a special resolution. \n23. It is not in dispute that the subsidiary propri etors who attended the meetings were in \narrears of maintenance contributions. Accordingly, they were, under paragraph 2 of the \nFirst Schedule of the Act, not entitled to vote. \n24. In the minutes of the general meetings on 27 Ma r 2007, 19 May 2010 and 25 April 2013 \nwhen the meeting was considering the contribution t o the Management Fund it is \nrecorded: \nIt was determined that the contributions to the man agement fund be remained at $550 \nper share value per month payable monthly on the fi rst day of the month. \n25. At the general meetings on 21 April 2008, 28 Ap ril 2009, 10 May 2011, and 13 August \n2012, the minutes recorded: \nIt was determined that the contribution to the mana gement fund be remained at $550 \nper share value per month payable quarterly on the first day of the month of January, \nApril, July and October. Hiap Seng Press (Pte) Ltd                      STB No.41  of 2018 (Wing Yip Building) \nv The MCST No. 246 \n \n8 \n  \n26. There is no record of any discussion, objection s or of votes being taken and it will be \nin order to conclude that there was unanimity among  all who were present that the \namount of contribution to be levied from all subsid iary proprietors was $550 per month \nper share value. \n27. In Si-Hoe Kok Chun and anor v Ramesh Ramchandani [2006 ] SGHC 15  Andrew Ang \nJ when dealing with an appeal from a decision made by the Strata Titles Board did not \nconsider that it was improper for annual general me etings of a management corporation \nto be conducted in an informal manner and applied t he following pronouncement of Lai \nKew Chai J in Jimat bin Awang v Lai Wee Ngen[1995] 3 SLR (R) 496 \nGenerally, a company exercises any of its powers by  means of resolutions in general \nmeetings. It is also a well-entrenched common law p rinciple that the unanimous and \ninformal assent by all the members of a company in some other manner is as effective \nas a resolution passed at a general meeting even if  the assent is given at different times: \nsee Parker and Cooper Limited v Reading [1926] CH 9 75, and even if otherwise a \nspecial or extraordinary resolution is required: se e Cane v Jones [1981] 1 All ER 533 \n28. In this case no resolutions were passed when th e respondent made its determinations in \nconnection with the amount to be levied from subsid iary proprietors for the \nmanagement fund. There was unanimity among all who were present that the amount \nof contribution to be levied from all subsidiary pr oprietors was $550 per month per \nshare value and there was no breach or non-complian ce with any of the provisions of \nthe Act when the determinations were made. \n29. It is also the finding of the Board that even i f there was non-compliance with the \nprovisions of the Act when the determinations were made, there was no prejudice \nsuffered by the applicant. The applicant referred t o DC 3179 of 2014 and submitted that \nit was the passing of the resolutions in breach of the provisions of the Act that was the \ncause of the suit filed against it. It is the findi ng of the Board that it was not the passing \nof resolutions that led to the suit being filed aga inst the applicant. As pointed out above \nit is a compulsory requirement under the Act for th e management corporation at a \ngeneral meeting to determine the amount that is rea sonable and necessary to be raised \nby way of contributions for the management fund and  after the amount has been \ndetermined it can be levied on the subsidiary propr ietors by way of a notice in writing \nand the amount will be due and payable to the manag ement corporation. It was, not the \ndetermination of the amount of the contribution but  the failure on the part of the \napplicant to pay contributions levied under the Act  that led to the suit filed against it. \n \n Hiap Seng Press (Pte) Ltd                      STB No.41  of 2018 (Wing Yip Building) \nv The MCST No. 246 \n \n9 \n  \n \n \n30.

In this case an application for orders under the Bu ilding Maintenance and Strata \nManagement Act Cap 30C (Cap 30C) was filed by three  subsidiary proprietors for \norders against the management corporation in connec tion with a collective sale process \nie  an application has been made for orders under Cap 30C in connection with a process \nunder the Land Titles (Strata) Act Cap 158 (Cap 158 ).  \n \nTHE FACTS: \n \n2.  Following requisitions for an extra ordinary genera l meeting (EOGM) to be convened \nto consider a collective sale of Braddell View Esta te a meeting was convened by the \nmanagement corporation on 10 October 2017. Chan Yoon Sun and 2 others   STB No.28 of 2018 (Braddell View) \nv The MCST Plan No. 4340 \n3 \n 3.  The meeting was convened in compliance with paragra ph 2 of the Second Schedule of \nCap 158. Under this provision, a management corpora tion is required to convene a \ngeneral meeting of the management corporation after  a requisition signed by \nsubsidiary proprietors who hold at least 20% of the  aggregate share value of all of the \nlots or 25% of the total number of subsidiary propr ietors. There was overwhelming \nsupport for a collective sale (\u201cFor\u201d \u2013 493: \u201cAgains t\u201d -28) and a collective sale \ncommittee (CSC) with 14 members was elected. A reso lution in connection with the \npowers, duties and functions of the CSC was passed unanimously. \n \n4.  Following requisitions for an EOGM to be convened b y the management corporation \nto deliberate on the matters listed in the agenda a  meeting was convened on 06 Feb \n2018. The meeting was convened in compliance with P aragraph 7 of the Third \nSchedule of Cap 158 which is as follows: \n \n7-(1) The collective sale committee shall convene o ne or more general meetings of \nthe management corporation in accordance with the S econd Schedule for the \nfollowing purposes \n \n5.   The purposes are listed at (a) to (c) in Paragraph 7 viz to appoint any advocate and \nsolicitor; any property consultant or marketing age nt where the CSC is not already \nauthorised to make such appointments; to approve th e apportionment of sale proceeds; \nand to approve the terms and conditions of the coll ective sale agreement (CSA). \n \n6.  The Second Schedule of Cap 158 sets out various pro visions in connection with \nGeneral Meetings For Purposes Of Collective Sale and there can be no doubt that this \nis so as it is stipulated in Paragraph 1 of the Sec ond Schedule that This Schedule shall \napply only to any general meeting convened by a man agement corporation for the \npurposes of a collective sale. \n \n            543 subsidiary proprietors with a total  share value of 59,101 attended the meeting  \n \n7.  In the minutes of the meeting it is interalia  recorded    \ni) the opening address by the chairman, Mr Alex Tio ;   \nii) minutes of the EOGM held on 10 Oct 2017 were unanimously confirmed without an      \namendment.  It is not recorded that there were votes cast on t his.  \niii) a declaration by the chairman that Colliers In ternational (Singapore) Pte Ltd was \nappointed as sole property consultant and property agent after the vice chairman of the \nCSC, Mr Charles Chan had informed the meeting that the CSC had been empowered \nby the subsidiary proprietors at the EOGM on 10 Oct  2017 to decide on the \nappointment of the property consultant and property  agent and as such there was no \nnecessity for the resolution to be voted upon;  \niv)  a declaration by the chairman that M/s Lee and  Lee was appointed as advocate and \nsolicitor after the vice chairman of the CSC had in formed the meeting that the CSC \nhad been empowered by the subsidiary proprietors at  the EOGM on 10 Oct 2017 to \ndecide on the appointment of the advocate and solic itor and as such there was no \nnecessity for the resolution to be voted upon;  \nv) votes were cast in connection with apportionment  of the sale proceeds. The meeting \napproved the apportionment of the proceeds of sale by a majority of 91.6% v 8.4%. \nBefore casting of the votes the representative from  Colliers International (Singapore) Chan Yoon Sun and 2 others   STB No.28 of 2018 (Braddell View) \nv The MCST Plan No. 4340 \n4 \n Pte Ltd spoke on the reserve price; there was a dis cussion that the valuation method \nused was wrong; comments on the rate disparity betw een shop houses and flat owners; \ncomments that information provided by   Colliers In ternational (Singapore) Pte Ltd \nwas misleadin g; and comments with regard to fairness of the valu ation report.                                                             \nvi) votes were cast in connection with the terms an d conditions of the CSA. The \nmeeting approved the terms and conditions of the CS A by a majority of 93.7% v 6.3%. \nBefore casting of votes the solicitor from M/s Lee and Lee spoke on some of the \npoints and clauses.    \nvii) votes were cast on the resolution for MCST extend all assistance to facilitate the \nCollective Sale . The result was 96% v 04%. There is no record of a ny discussion \nbefore votes were cast. \n \n8.  The applicants are three subsidiary proprietors in the estate and they have under \nsection 103 of Cap 30C applied for the following or der \n \u2026that resolutions (1),(2), (3), (4),(5), and (6) p urportedly passed at the Extra \n Ordinary General Meeting of the MCST Strata Title Plan No 4340 convened on 06 \n Feb 2018\u2026be invalidated \n \n9.  The applicants were in effect applying for all the resolutions passed at the meeting on \n06 Feb 2018 to be invalidated. In section E of Form  8 where applicants are required to \nset out the reasons for seeking the orders applied for the applicants informed that the \nmeeting was \u201c marred with procedurally irregular and not carried out in accordance \nwith the with the Building Maintenance and Strata M anagement Act (Cap 30C). The \nprocedural irregularities are not mere technicaliti es but in fact reflect serious issues \nwith the collective sale process in the lack of ope n communication and transparency \nfrom the CSC .\u201d In essence the complaint was that there were pro cedural irregularities, \nlack of transparency, unfairness, conflict of inter est and bias.  \n \n10.  Section 103 of Cap 30C is as follows: \n \n Order to invalidate proceedings \n 103.\u2014(1) Where, pursuant to an application by a su bsidiary  proprietor or first  \n      mortgagee of a lot, a Board considers that th e provisions of this Act have not       \n     been complied with in relation to a meeting of  the management corporation \n     or subsidiary management corporation, the Boar d may, by order \u2014 \n  (a) invalidate any resolution of, or election hel d by, the persons present at the \n      meeting; or \n                        (b) refuse to invalidate an y such resolution or election. \n \n        (2) A Board shall not make an order under s ubsection (1) refusing to invalidate a \n  resolution or election unless it considers \u2014 \n  (a) that the failure to comply with the provision s of this Act did not  \n       prejudicially affect any person; and \n                        (b) that compliance with th e provisions of this Act would not have resulted in  a \n       failure to pass the resolution, or have affe cted the result of the election, as \n     the case may be. \n \n Chan Yoon Sun and 2 others   STB No.28 of 2018 (Braddell View) \nv The MCST Plan No. 4340 \n5 \n APPLICANTS\u2019 CASE: \n \n11.  With regard to the procedural irregularities it was  the case for the applicants that the \nchairman of the management corporation who, under P aragraph 6 of the First Schedule \nof Cap30C is required to preside at any general meeting of the management \ncorporation had relinquished all control over the meeting when he \u201c passed\u201d  the \nmicrophone to the vice chairman of the CSC. It was the contention of the applicants \nthat the result of this was that it led to the vice  chairman of the CSC, who was \nmotivated to ensure success of the collective sale to become the de facto chairman of \nthe meeting. In connection with the various resolut ions it was contended that there was \nno proposer or seconder for the adoption of the min utes of the meeting on the 10 \nOctober 2017 and there was no vote taken; there was  also no voting on the \nappointment of the property consultant/marketing ag ent and the lawyers; and that the \nresolution in connection with the apportionment of proceeds of sale was passed under \nquestionable circumstances. It was contended that t he meeting had been misinformed \nof the legal requirement before the apportionment o f proceeds of sale was approved \nand that the resolution approving the terms and con dition of the CSA should be \ninvalidated because the reserve price was not discu ssed or fixed without sufficient \ndiscussion. It was contended that the resolution in  connection with the management \ncorporation extending all assistance to facilitate the collective sale was vague, very \nwide and not understood could lead to a violation o f section 38(9A)  of Cap30C in the \nevent that funds were expended from the management and sinking funds for the \npurposes of the collective sale. \n \n12.  It was submitted that the applicants had in this ca se suffered real prejudice . Other than \nthe fact that the meeting had resulted in advancing  the interests of subsidiary \nproprietors who were in favour of a collective sale  over the interests of those who were \nnot, it was not clear as to what was the prejudice suffered by the applicants. \n \nRESPONDENT\u2019S CASE : \n \n13.  It was the submission of the respondent that becaus e the applicants were seeking to \ninvalidate resolutions in connection with a collect ive sale, it was not within the \njurisdiction of the Board to make a decision in fav our of the applicants. The applicable \nlegislation was Cap 158 and there was no breach of the provisions in Cap 30C. \n \n14.  It was also the submission of the respondent that t here were no irregularities at the \nmeeting on 6 Feb 2018; that under paragraph 8 of th e Second Schedule of Cap 158 it is \nnot a strict requirement that the actual chairperso n of the management corporation to \nbe the chair of the general meeting for a collectiv e sale; that there is also no legal \nrequirement that a chairperson must have control of  the microphone throughout a \nmeeting and passing the microphone to the chairman of the CSC was not irregular; \nthere was no necessity for votes where votes were n ot taken and given the \noverwhelming majority by which the resolutions have  been passed,\u2026it would be \ndifficult for the applicants to make the case (and they have not) that the resolutions \nwould not have passed if there was no alleged irreg ularities. \n \n \n Chan Yoon Sun and 2 others   STB No.28 of 2018 (Braddell View) \nv The MCST Plan No. 4340 \n6 \n BOARD\u2019S DECISION  \n \n15.  Strata Titles Boards were established for the purpo se of adjudicating disputes between \nsubsidiary proprietors and management corporations and between one subsidiary \nproprietor and another i.e.  disputes arising from the use or occupation of lot s and the \ncommon property.  The intention was that the courts  would not be overloaded with \nsuch disputes. It can be noted that the dispute in this case is in fact, not between \nsubsidiary proprietors and the management corporati on but between the applicants and \nthe CSC. \n \n16.  Part VA of Cap 158 sets out the various provisions in connection with collective sales. \nIt was enacted to facilitate collective sales i.e.  to allow for all the lots and the common \nproperty in a strata title plan to be sold collecti vely and ensure sufficient safeguards to \nbalance the interests of the majority owners and th e minority. Whilst it is provided that \nan application for a collective sale under Cap 158 must be made to a Board constituted \nunder Cap 30C, the powers of the Board have since  Cap 158 was amended on 15 July \n2010 been significantly reduced. It was the intenti on of parliament when amending \nCap 158 that in connection with a collective sale t he Board when dealing with an \napplication for a collective would be focused on me diation. \n \n We therefore propose that the STB focus on its med iatory function for en bloc sale \n application per The Minister for Law at the Second Reading of t he Land Titles (Strata) \n (Amendment) Bill on 18 May 2010 \n \n17. When the Board is involved in an application fo r a collective sale under Cap 158 it is \n provided in section 84G of Cap 158 that \n \n Part VI of the Building Maintenance and Strata Man agement Act (Cap 30C) and any \n regulations made under that Act shall apply in res pect of applications under this Part \n with the necessary modifications   \n \n18.  Part VI of Cap 30C is interalia  concerned with the composition of a Board; the \nmanner as to how it is to execute its duties, its p owers for the making of orders; \nspecific orders that it can make and the legal effe cts of its orders. With regard to the \nspecific orders that it can make, it can be noted t hat unlike Part V of Cap 158 (where \nspecific powers have been given to a Board to  interalia , mediate; subject to section \n84A (9) make an order for a collective sale when no  objections have been filed; and \nwhen mediation is not successful, make a section 84 A stop order) there is in Part VI of \nCap 30C no power to make a specific order in connec tion with a collective sale. \n \n19.  The application in this case is for the Board to ma ke an order pursuant to its powers \nunder section 103 of Cap 30C, specifically for an o rder to invalidate resolutions made \nat a meeting of the management corporation on 06 Fe b 2018 because provisions in \nrelation to meetings (paragraph 6 of the First Sche dule of Cap 30C) had not been \ncomplied with. Was the meeting on the 6 Feb 2018 go verned by the First Schedule of \nCap 30C? Both Cap 158 and Cap 30C provide for the c onvening of general meetings, \nand regulations have been made in connection with g eneral meetings under the \nrespective Acts. It can be noted that in Cap 30C th e regulations in connection with \ngeneral meeting viz the First and Second Schedules of Cap 30C are applicable to Chan Yoon Sun and 2 others   STB No.28 of 2018 (Braddell View) \nv The MCST Plan No. 4340 \n7 \n matters in Part V of Cap 30C i.e they are not appli cable to matters under Cap 158. In \nCap 158 the regulations viz Second Schedule of Cap 158 are applicable to a general \nmeeting convened by a management corporation for th e purposes of a collective sale   \n \n20.  When a Board is involved in a dispute or any matter  in connection with application for \na collective sale, it will have jurisdiction, dutie s and powers spelt out in Part VI of Cap \n30C. The jurisdiction, duties and powers of a Board  in connection with a collective \nsale will arise only when there is an application f or a collective sale under Cap 158. \nThis is clear from section 84G of Cap 158.  Part VI  of Cap 30C shall apply in respect \nof applications under Part VA of Cap 158. There is no provision that allo ws for a \nBoard to have jurisdiction, duties and powers in co nnection with a collective sale, \nincluding powers to invalidate resolutions at meeti ngs regulated by the Second \nSchedule of Cap 158 when there is no application fo r a collective sale.  \n \n21.  There is in this case, no doubt that the meeting on  06 Feb 2018 was convened in \ncompliance with paragraph 2 of the Second Schedule of Cap 158. It was not a meeting \nunder any of the provisions of Cap 30C. The subsidi ary proprietors of Braddel View \nEstate were on 10 Oct 2017 and 06 Feb 2018 complyin g with relevant laws and \nrequirements before an application for a collective  sale could be made under section \n84A(2A) of Cap 158. Part VI of Cap 30C including se ction 103 of Cap 30C was not \napplicable because there was at that point of time no application for a collective sale \nunder Part VA of Cap 158 in existence. As far as th e Board is aware there was also no \napplication for a collective sale pending when the applicants filed their applications in \nthis case. The meeting on 06 Feb 2018 was not a mee ting under the provisions of Cap \n30C and accordingly it is not possible to make a fi nding that there was non-\ncompliance with any of the provisions of Cap 30C. T he application for an order under \nsection 103 of Cap 30C is dismissed. \n \n22.  The respondent had submitted that under paragraph 8  of the Second Schedule of Cap \n158 it was not a strict requirement that the chairp erson of the management corporation \nto be the chair of the general meeting for a collec tive sale and any person present at the \nmeeting would suffice if properly elected and that person w ould be the chairperson of \nthe management corporation. The Board does not agree that this is correct. The \nchairperson of the management corporation must pres ide at any general meeting of a \nmanagement corporation where he is present. It is o nly when he is absent that the \npersons present and who are entitled to vote can el ect one of their number to preside. \n \n23.  It will be in order to record that it is not the fi nding of the Board that there was any \nirregularity at the meeting on 06 Feb 2018; and if Cap 30C was applicable, there is no \nevidence that the applicants had been prejudiced an d that compliance with the \nprovisions would have resulted in a failure to pass  the resolutions. \n \n  Chan Yoon Sun and 2 others   STB No.28 of 2018 (Braddell View) \nv The MCST Plan No. 4340 \n8 \n  \n24.

Applicants are the subsidiary proprietors of unit #XXX Sherwood Towers. They\nsought orders from the Board for the first Respondents who are the subsidiary \nproprietors of unit #XXX to engage a contractor to carry out repairs to stop water  \nleakage from unit # XXX into unit #XXX and to make good damages caused to the  \nceiling boards in unit #XXX and costs.Lee Kum Huat Edward/Ang Mei Kway Rosalind       STB No. 117 of 2017 (Sherwood Towers) \nv 1) Ang Lay Kian/Soh Kian Shang \n3 2)Ng Wai Chun/Lee Kuo Kaan\n2.The first Respondents denied liability and alleged that the water leakages complained  \nof were not from their unit but from unit # XXX. The first Respondents therefore  \nbrought in the subsidiary proprietors of unit #XXX as the second Respondents.\nTHE APPLICANTS\u2019 CASE \n3.Rosalind Ang, (AW1), one the Applicants testified. She said that between 6 November \n2007 to 25 February 2017, there were leakages from units # XXX and #XXX into her  \nunit #XXX. These leakages were rectified and there were no more leakages until 21 \nAugust 2017. However, the damages to her ceiling boards remained unresolved.\n4.On 21 August 2017, water leakages began to appear on the ceiling of the master  \nbedroom. She alleged that these leakages were from unit # XXX but the subsidiary \nproprietors of that unit i.e. the first Respondents denied liability. She engaged an \nexpert, one ER Chong Keng Wee of Inter-Project Consortium, to investigate into the  \ncauses of the leakages and put up a report.\n5.ER Chong Keng Wee (AW2) testified. He said he is a professional engineer for both \ncivil and structural. He was engaged by the owners of unit # XXX to investigate the  \nleakages encountered at the master bedroom toilet. He concluded that waste water from \nthe floor of the toilet in unit #XXX and the waste water from the cast iron waste pipes \nbelonging to unit # XXX were the causes of the leakages. He concluded that the  water \nleakages into unit #XXX was from unit #XXX. He tendered his report marked(A1).\nTHE SECOND RESPONDENTS \u2019 CASE\n6.Ng Wai Chun, (2RW1), one of the subsidiary proprietors of unit #XXX testified.  She \nsaid that the previous leakages which originated from her unit had been fully  rectified. \nThere were no more leakages until 21 August 2017 when subsidiary proprietors of unit \n#XXX complained of leakages into their unit. Thes e new leakages  into unit #XXX \nwere not from her unit as alleged by the first Respondents. She therefore had to engage \nan expert to investigate. She engaged expert ER Chong Keng Wee, the same expert \nengaged by the subsidiary proprietors of unit #XXX.\n7.ER Chong (AW2) testified. He said he was engaged by the second Respondents to  \ninvestigate whether there were any leakages of waste water from unit #XXX into unit  \n#XXX. He said he conducted a series of tests, using blue coloured dye in unit #XXX. \nHe concluded that there was no leakage from unit # XXX into unit #XXX. He tendered \na report marked(A2).\nFrom his two reports to be read in conjunction with each other, his final conclusion  \nwas that the leakages to unit #XXX are solely due to the corroded sewer pipes and the  \nseepages of toilet floor water, both from unit # XXX.Lee Kum Huat Edward/Ang Mei Kway Rosalind       STB No. 117 of 2017 (Sherwood Towers) \nv 1) Ang Lay Kian/Soh Kian Shang \n2) Ng Wai Chun/Lee Kuo Kaan\n4 THE FIRST RESPONDENTS\u2019 CASE  \n8.Soh Kian Shang, one of the subsidiary proprietors of unit #XXX, testified. He said that \nwhen the Applicants complained on 20 August 2017 of leakages into their unit, he  \nwent to inspect but found no leakages from his sanitary pipes although there was some  \ndampness. He said the ceiling boards in Applicants\u2019 master bedroom toilet was dry. He  \nalso said he had engaged a plumber to examine the sanitary pipes and did water test \nand found no leaks.\n9.He said he disagreed with the reports tendered by expert ER Chong. He said the  reports \nhad wrong dates and did not contain all the relevant and necessary details and  the \nexpert did not carry out a proper investigation to determine the source of the water \nleakages, if any.\n10.He also objected that the expert is a professional civil engineer and not a building  \nsurveyor and that these investigations are normally done by professional\nmechanical/electrical engineers.\n11.Finally, he submitted that the damages to Applicants \u2019 ceiling boards were not caused  \nby the leakages from his unit as there was none but by the leakages from unit #XXX  \npreviously.\nBOARD\u2019S FINDING\n12.The Board finds that the leakages complained of by the Applicants in this application  \ncame from the unit of the first Respondents i.e. #XXX and therefore they are liable.\n13.The Board accepts the two reports submitted by the expert. The reports contained his \ninspections and various tests carried out by him. The first Respondents did not tender \nany report from his expert.\n14.The Board rejects the objections to the reports by the first Respondents as the reasons \nfor their objections are without merit.\nBOARD\u2019S ORDER\n15.The Board orders that the first Respondents carry out the repairs to the sources of the  \nleakages identified by the expert ER Chong in his two reports and in accordance with \nhis recommendations containe d therein, within two weeks from the date of this order.\n16.There is no conclusive evidence adduced to show that the damages to Applicants\u2019  \nceiling boards in their unit were caused by the leakages complained of in this  \napplication and not from the previous leakages.Lee Kum  Huat Edward/Ang Mei Kway Rosalind         STB No . 117 of 2017 (Sherwood Towers)  \nv 1) Ang  Lay Kian/Soh Kian Shang  \n   2) Ng Wai Chun/Lee Kuo Kaan  \n \n5 \n 17.

The Applicant, the Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 3127 (the \u201cMCST\u201d), \nis the management corporation of the development known as Le Crescendo, located at \n233 Paya Lebar Road Singapore 409044. The Respondent, Tay Boon Yong is the \nsubsidiary proprietor of unit #XXX in the development.\n2. The Applicant sought an order from the Board for the Respondent to remove certain  \nunapproved structures being, (i) stainless steel trellis covering; and (ii) stainless steelManagement Corporate Strata Title Plan No. 3127 STB No.84 of 2017 (Le Crescendo) \nv Tay Boon Yong \n3 railings on the glass panel (\u201cUnapproved Structures\u201d) , which were constructed by the \nRespondent without the approval or permission of the Applicant. \n3. The parties attended a total of two mediation sessions before the Board on 20 November\n2017 and 11 January 2018. At the end of the second mediation on 11 January 2018, as\nparties were still unable to settle the matter, the Board then gave directions for an\narbitration hearing to be fixed on 2 March  2018. The hearing was subsequently adjourned\nto 29 March 2018.\n4. At the hearing on 29 March 2018, parties agreed to a consent order before the Board on\nthe basis of without admission to liability by either party. As part ies could not agree on\ncosts, the decision was left to the Board. The Board subsequently heard parties on costs.\nAPPLI CANT\u2019S SUBMISSION S ON COSTS \n5. The Applicant sought for costs on an indemnity basis amounting to a total of S$20,000.00\n(Singapore Dollars Twenty Thousand) including disbursements and Goods and Services\nTax. The Applicant contended that the Board should order costs in favour of the Applicant\non an indemnity basis for the reasons below:\n(i) By-law passed at the 8th Annual General Meeting (\u201cAGM\u201d)\nIt was resolved at the 8th AGM that \u201c all costs, including legal costs on an indemnity\nbasis, disbursements and incidental costs incurred by the management corporation\nto enforce or to try to enforce any party\u2019s compliance with the Building\nMaintenance & Strata Management Act, other statutes, subsidiary legislation, by-\nlaw shall be recoverable from the party concerned. \u201d The Applicant submitted that\nthis by-law passed at the 8th AGM amounted to a contractually binding clause\nbetween subsidiary proprietors and MCST, and  consequently, the Board should\naward costs on an indemnity basis. Additionally, that there was good basis for the\nabove by-law as the MCST\u2019s funds should be used for the purposes of the\ndevelopment.\n(ii) Conduct of the Respondent\nThe Applicant contended that due to the Respondent\u2019s acts of non -compliance and\nhaving persistently undertaken works and constructions despite the Applicant\u2019s\ndirections not to do so, this application before the Board was necessary for the\nRespondent to comply with the Applicant\u2019s instructions to remove the Unapprov ed\nStructures.Management Corporate Strata Title Plan No. 3127 STB No.84 of 2017 (Le Crescendo) \nv Tay Boon Yong \n4 RESPONDENT\u2019S SUBMISSIONS ON COSTS \n6. The Respondent contend ed that no order to costs should be provided and that parties\nshould bear their own cos ts. The Respondent\u2019s reasons were as follows:\n(i) Section 32(3) of the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act\n(\u201cBMSMA\u201d)  does not provide the MCST with the power to pass by-laws with\nrespect to recovery of legal costs and the basis of such recovery;\n(ii) As regards to the conduct of parties, the Respondent highlight ed that there were\nvarious instances where settlement options had  been proposed. In addition, the\nRespondent also stated that she had attempted to resolve the matter by the letters\ndated 11 January 2015 and 23 May 2016;\n(iii) The Respondent contended that ordering costs on an indemnity basis is not\nequivalent to one party bearing all the legal costs of the other. The Respondent also\nrelied on the Strata Titles Boards case of Loh Mary/Tan Kar Keong v The MCST\nPlan No 3641 and Others  [2016] SGSTB 3 (\u201cLoh Mary \u201d) at [28], where the Board\nheld that it \u201c behooved on the MCST to on their part manage legal costs \u201d and as\nsuch, the Applicant ought to be responsible for managing its own costs;\n(iv) Based on the guidelines for party-and-party costs awards in the Supreme Court of\nSingapore, contentious originating summons before the High Court without cross-\nexamination would be an estimate of S$12,000.00 per day, while contested\nsummons of a complex or lengthy nature would be between S$4,000.00 and\nS$15,000.00. The Respondent noted that STB 84 of 2017 would not be considered\nto be complex or lengthy in nature and hence, any costs awarded should be much\nlower.\nBOARD\u2019S DECISION ON COSTS \n7. Section 117 of the BMSMA states as follows:\n\u201cAn order made by a Board under this Act or the Land Titles (Strata) Act (Cap. 158) may \ninclude such ancillary or consequential provisions as the Board thinks fit  including costs \nto be paid by the applicant, a management corporation, a subsidiary management \ncorporation or any person against whom the order is made or costs to be paid by a party \nfor making a frivolous application to the Board. \u201d (emphasis ours)  \n8. An initial question raised by the Applicant before the Board was whether the Board had,\nunder the provisions of the BMSMA, the power to determine costs where liability\nbetween the parties was not established. The Board wish to emphasise that  by the\nwordings of section 117 of the BMSMA, it is empowered to award costs as it thinks fitManagement Corporate Strata Title Plan No. 3127 STB No.84 of 2017 (Le Crescendo) \nv Tay Boon Yong \n5 and the provision also provides the Board with wide powers to award costs at its \ndiscretion. \n9. The position proposed by the Applicant is an unambiguous abrogation of the exercise of\nthe Board\u2019s duties to judiciously decide on the matters before it. It is for the Board to\ndecide, on the merits of each and every case, whether it should make an order under\nDivision 2 of the BMSMA. Once a Board has made a determination regarding the matters\nbefore them, the Board\u2019s discretion in awarding costs ranges from providing no order as\nto costs and where appropriate, awarding costs on an indemnity basis. To suggest\notherwise would be to shackle the Board\u2019s discretionary power s under section 117 of the\nBMSMA and its net effect would be to render section 117 redundant.\n10. With respect to a consent order made before the Board, the legal effect and force of such\na consent order are ultimately derived from the order of the Board. The Board has the\nright and power to decide upon the finality of a consent order, and where appropriate ,\ndisagree to its terms.\nBy-laws \n11. Having considered the submissions by both parties, the Board is of the view that nothing\nin the provisions of BMSMA indicates that the MCST is empowered to pass by-laws\nwhich would interfere with the Board\u2019s discretionary powers to award costs under section\n117 of the BMSMA.\n12. We are of the opinion that even if the 8th AGM  by-law was passed by the subsidiary\nproprietors, the presence or existence of such by-laws relating to the recovery basis of\nlegal costs wou ld not bind or restrict the Board\u2019s discretion to award costs under section\n117 of the BMSMA. The Applicant was misguided in their submission in believing that\nthe 8th AGM by-law could or would fetter the discretion of the Board under section 117.\n13. If the Applicant intends to rely on the by-law passed at the 8th AGM, the Board is of the\nopinion that such by-law relating to the recovery basis of legal costs was made on a\ncontractual basis between the MCST and the subsidiary proprietors of the development.\nWhether this by-law is enforceable in contract is for another forum to decide and the\nBoard is not in any position to adjudicate or comment on  the matter.\nIndemnity costs \n14. It is trite law that costs may be awarded on an indemnity basis if there are exceptional\ncircumstances justifying such an award. In the High Court case of Airtrust (Hong Kong)\nLtd v PH Hydraulics & Engineering Pte Ltd  [2016] SGHC 167, Justice Chan Seng Onn\nat [50] stated:Management Corporate Strata Title Plan No. 3127 STB No.84 of 2017 (Le Crescendo) \nv Tay Boon Yong \n6 \u201cAs a baseline inquiry, it may be useful for a court to ask itself whether the party\u2019s conduct \nwas so unreasonable as to justify an award of indemnity costs\u2026such unreasonableness, \nhowever, need not rise to the level of dishonesty or moral iniquity for it to attract \nindemnity\u2026the extent of a party\u2019s dishonest and u nscrupulous intentions and actions, \nwhere present, will be relevant factors for the court to take into account. \u201d  \nJustice Chan also mentioned at [53] that although \u201c there may be situations where \nindemnity costs could be ordered despite the absence of unreasonable conduct, these will, \nin my judgment, be rare cases. \u201d \n15. In view of the above, the Board finds that there are insufficient facts to substantiate the\nApplicant\u2019s contention to award costs on an indemnity basis. On the present facts, no\nexceptional circumstances exist. Furthermore, despite the Respondent\u2019s persistent\ndisagreement to remove the Unapproved Structures, it cannot be said that her actions were\nso unreasonable as to justify an award of indemnity costs. Accordingly, costs would be\nawarded on the standard basis.\nQuantum \n16. The Applicant had submitted that costs should be on an indemnity basis for the total\namount of S$20,000.00. As mentioned  above, there are insufficient facts to provide for\ncosts on an indemnity basis and as such, determination of the quantum for costs awarded\nshall be made on the standard basis.\n17. The Board reiterates its decision in the STB case of Loh Mary,  and agrees that it is\nincumbent on the MCST to manage its legal costs, especially in light of the fact that the\npayment of such costs ultimately stems from the subsidiary proprietors\u2019 contributions to\nthe development\u2019 s funds.\n18. In addition, the Board agrees with the submission of the Respondent, that in comparison\nwith the guidelines for party-and -party costs awards in the Supreme Court of Singapore,\nthe Applicant\u2019s requested costs amount for S$20,000.00 is excessive.  The Board\nappreciates that for complex or lengthy summon applications fixed for special hearing,\nthe costs order guidelines provides for an estimate of between S$4,000.00 and\nS$15,000.00 excluding disbursements. It is plainly clear on the present facts that the\nmatter was neither complex nor lengthy. As such, it would be inappropriate for the Board\nto award costs for a sum of S$20,000.00.\n19. Notwithstanding the above, the Board disagrees with the Respondent\u2019s contention that no\norder to costs should be provided. The Board notes that when questioned in the course of\nthe costs hearing, the Respondent had acknowledged that the current application takenManagement Corporate Strata Title Plan No. 3127 STB No.84 of 2017 (Le Crescendo) \nv Tay Boon Yong \n7 out by the applicant cannot be considered frivolous or vexatious, which in our opinion, \nwas correct. \n20. In view of all of the above, the Board accordingly orders that the Respondent pays the\nApplicant costs as follows:\n(i) Costs of S$4,000.00;\n(ii) Reimbursement of all fees payable to the STB for the sum of S$1,100.00 being\napplication fee, hearing fee and fee for delivery of decision; and\n(iii) Reasonable disbursements.\nDated this 10th day of April 2018 \n________________________ _____ \nMR ALFONSO ANG \nPresident \n____________________________ ___ \nMR LOH KWI LEONG \nMember \n      __ ______________________________  \nMR CHAN KOK WAY \nMember \nMr Srijit Jeshua Shashedaran (M/s Netto & Magin LLC) the Applicant \nMr Adrian Wong / Mr Leong Hao Ang (M/s Rajah & Tann Singapore LLP) for the Respondent  "

The Applicant, Siah Yang Tek , Timothy is the subsidiary proprietor of unit #01 -04 in the \ndevelopment known as Balestier Point located at 279 Balestier Road Singapore 329727 \nand the Respondents, 28th Management Council to MCST Plan No. 1420 (the \u201cMCST\u201d ), \nis the 28th Management Council to the management corporation of the development.  \n \n2. This is a matter concerning section 47 of the Building Maintenance and Strata \nManagement Act, Chapter 30C ( \u201cBMSMA\u201d ), where the Applicant made a request to \nobtain a copy  of an audio reco rding made by MCST Plan No. 1420 at the 28th Annual \nGeneral Meeting (the \u201cAGM\u201d ). \n  Timothy Siah Yang Tek   STB No .82 of 2017 ( Balestier Point ) \nv 28th Management Council to MCST 1420  \n3 \n BACKGROUND  \n \n3. The AGM of the MCST was held on 22 July 2017. The Applicant was unable to be present \nat the AGM and appointed his father, Siah Ooi Choe Francis as his proxy to a ttend the \nAGM on his behalf.  \n \n4. Following the AGM, the Applicant\u2019s father informed him that matters regarding \nallocation of parking lots within the development and the income generated from parking \nlots of the development were discussed during the AGM (the \u201cDiscussions\u201d ). However, \nthe Applicant\u2019s father could not remember the details of the Discussions.  \n \n5. By a circular dated 24 July 2017, the MCST informed all subsidiary proprietors of the \nresolutions passed at the AGM. The circular did not mention matters re lated to the \nDiscussion s. \n \n6. On 18 August 2017 and by a WhatsApp message to Mr Richard Tang, Director of Dickson \nProperty Consultants Pte Ltd and managing a gent of the development ( \u201cRichard\u201d ), the \nApplicant requested for \u201c the audio / video recording of the l atest AGM at Balestier Point. \u201d \nRichard replied on the same day and confirmed that an \u201caudio recording in CD format \u201d \nwas available. However, he informed the Applicant that approval from the Respondents  \nhad to be obtained.  \n \n7. Upon further queries made by the A pplicant regarding the AGM recording, Richard \nreplied and sought to clarify the Applicant\u2019s intentions for requesting for the AGM \nrecording and which portion of the recording he required. Richard also informed the \nApplicant that the Respondent s were concer ned with legal implications such as the \nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012 (\u201cPDPA\u201d) . The Applicant responded to Richard\u2019s \nmessage and stated that he was requesting for the AGM recording as a subsidiary \nproprietor and that no explanations for his request wer e needed.  \n \n8. By a WhatsApp message on 29 August 2017, Richard notified the Applicant that the \nadvice he had received was not to release the AGM audio recording. Instead, a copy of \nthe minutes of the AGM was extended to the Applicant.  \n \n9. By a letter dated 29 Au gust 2017, the Applicant through his solicitors, M/s Lee & Lee, \nwrote to the Respondent s requesting to \u201c inspect and take copies of the audio recording of \nthe entire proceedings of the 28th Annual General Meeting held on 22 July 2017 \u201d, \npursuant to section 47 of the BMSMA. It was further highlighted that the provisions of \nthe PDPA do not entitle the MCST to refuse the Applicant\u2019s request.  \n \n10. The Respondent s replied by way of letter dated 5 September 2017, and indicated that the \nMCST were in no position to prov ide the Applicant with a copy of the AGM\u2019s audio \nrecording due to legal implications such as the PDPA. However, the Applicant was invited Timothy Siah Yang Tek   STB No .82 of 2017 ( Balestier Point ) \nv 28th Management Council to MCST 1420  \n4 \n by the Respondent s to listen to the AGM\u2019s audio recording at the MCST\u2019s office by prior \nappointment.  \n \n11. By a letter date d 8 September 2017, M/s Lee & Lee reiterated the legal position that the \nApplicant is entitled to inspect and take copies of the AGM\u2019s audio recording pursuant to \ns.47 of the BMSMA. In addition, it also specified that the MCST was not entitled to refuse \nthe Applicant\u2019s request by reason of the PDPA as s.4(6)(b) of the PDPA states that \u201c the \nprovisions of other written law shall prevail to the extent that any provision of Parts III \nto VI is inconsistent with the provisions of that other written law. \u201d \n \n12. On 19 S eptember 2017, the Applicant made an application to the Strata Titles Boards for \nan order under section 113 of the BMSMA.  \n \nAPPLICANT\u2019S CASE  \n \n13. The Applicant relied on the case of Tan Hee Chye v MCST Plan No. 395  [2016] SGSTB \n1 (\u201cTan Hee Chye \u201d), where the Board had previously held that the audio recordings of \nan annual general meeting is a \u2018record or document\u2019 under section 47 of the BMSMA. \nThe Board applied the literal Oxford Dictionary meanings of \u2018record\u2019 and \u2018document\u2019 and \nheld that audio recordings of an annual general meeting fell within both definitions.  \n \n14. The Applicant relies on the express wording of the word \u2018shall\u2019 under section 47 of the \nBMSMA, the  claims that the  Respondent s are bound by a mandatory obligation to allow \nthe Applicant to inspect and take copies of the AGM audio recording . Section 47(1)(b)(iv) \nBMSMA and section 47(4) BMSMA states:  \n \n\u201cA management corporation shall , upon application made to it in writing in respect of  a \nlot which is the subject of the subdivided building concerned by a \u2026 subsidiary proprietor \n\u2026 and on payment of a prescribed fee \u2026 make available for inspection by the applicant \nor his agent \u2026 any other record or document in the custody or under the cont rol of the \nmanagement corporation \u201d. (emphasis ours)  \n \n\u201cA person entitled to inspect a document made available under subsection (1)(b) may \ntake extracts from or make a copy of, the document\u2026 \u201d \n \n15. In addition, the Applicant relies on the Strata Titles Board deci sion in Tan Hee Chye  \nwhich states that:  \n \n\u201c(A Management Corporation\u2019s) duties under section 47 of the BMSMA require the \n(Management Corporation) to make all available for in spection the documents specified \nin the section upon payment of the prescribed fee. \u201d (emphasis ours)  \n \n16. The Applicant contends that as the Respondent s had invited the Applicant to listen to the \nAGM audio recording by its letter dated 5 September 2017, the Respondent s had in doing Timothy Siah Yang Tek   STB No .82 of 2017 ( Balestier Point ) \nv 28th Management Council to MCST 1420  \n5 \n so, acknowledged that it was bound under section 47(1)(b)(iv ) of the BMSMA to allow \nan inspection of the AGM audio recording without the Applicant providing any reasons . \n \n17. The Applicant also maintains that there was no breach of the PDPA pursuant to section \n4(6)(b) of the PDPA,  as the Respondents \u2019 obligations under section 47 of the BMSMA \nprevail over  any provisions of  Parts III to VI of the PDPA.  Section 4(6)(b) of the PDPA \nprovides that:  \n \n\u201cUnless otherwise expressly provided in this Act \u2013 the provisions of other written law \nshall prevail to the e xtent that any provisions of Parts III to VI is inconsistent with the \nprovisions of that other written law\u201d . \n \n18. At paragraph 7 of Mr Loo Ngee Long\u2019s (Chairman of the Respondent s) affidavit of \nevidence -in-chief, Mr Loo had affirmed that the \u201c audio recordings are and were at all \nmaterial times under the custody and control of Dickson Property Consultants\u201d  and that \n\u201cat no time were the recordings ever under the custody and control of the Respondent \u201d. \nThe Applicant  disputes the above position taken by Mr Loo  and contended that the \nRespondent s and its representatives have by their conduct and through various \ncorrespondences shown clearly that the AGM audio recording is in the Respondents \u2019 \ncustody or under its control.  \n \nRESPONDENTS\u2019 CASE  \n \n19. The Respondents gave t heir evidence through Loo Ngee Long (Chairman of the \nRespondents), and Tang Kiam Peng ( Director of Dickson Property Consultants Pte Ltd) , \nalso known as Richard . \n \n20. The Respondents also referred to the case of Tan Hee Chye . In contrast , the Respondents\u2019 \nposit ion is that the decision in Tan Hee Chye  should not be followed as the Board had \npreviously failed to recognise that the right of a subsidiary proprietor to make copies only \nextends to documents in the written form. The Respondents submit that as section 4 7(4) \nof the BMSMA only provides a person to \u201c take extracts from, or make a copy of, the \ndocument \u201d, the provision only provides the Applicant with the right to make a copy of a \n\u201cdocument \u201d and not of a \u201c record \u201d or any other item.  \n \n21. In addition, the Respondents state that a \u201c document \u201d referred to in section 47(4) BMSMA \nshould be taken to be something in the written form due to section 11 of the Building \nMaintenance (Strata Management) Regulations 2005 (\u201cBMSMR\u201d) . The Respondents\u2019 \nargument is that as se ction 11 of the BMSMR provides that making a copy of any \ndocument would cost 50 cents per page, this in turn, made it clear t hat section 47(4) of \nthe BMSMA is referring only to documents in the written form that can be printed out in \npages and not to infor mation in the form of audio recordings or any other medium  \n Timothy Siah Yang Tek   STB No .82 of 2017 ( Balestier Point ) \nv 28th Management Council to MCST 1420  \n6 \n 22. The Respondent s contend that its obligations under s.47 of the BMSMA should be guided \nby the requirements and restricti ons in the PDPA. The Respondent s\u2019 position is that \naccording to section 13 of  the PDPA, the managing agent is allowed to record the AGM \nonly if the managi ng agent has been given consent  or deemed consent by the individuals \npresent at or attending the AGM. It was the Respondents\u2019 position that the express  or \ndeemed consent of the su bsidiary proprietors  was only obtained with regards to the  \ncollect ion of  their personal data for purposes of setting the minutes of meeting in the \nwritten form, and at the very most, the purpose of collecting the information was for \nrecording attendance at  AGM and identification of proposer and seconder for the \nresolutions which needed to be passed at the AGM.  Thus, the Respondent s would not be \nable to release or disclose copies of the AGM audio recording due to the lack of consent.  \n \n23. Furthermore, the Respon dents specifically highlighted section 21(3)(c) of the PDPA \nwhich precludes an organisation from providing an individual with his personal data or \nother information if the provision of such data or other information could \u201c reasonably be \nexpected to reveal personal data about another individual \u201d. The Respondents highlighted \nthat should the audio recording  be released  in its entirety, it would definitely reveal \npersonal data about the other subsidiary proprietors . \n \n24. The Respondents relied on Tang Kiam  Peng\u2019s Affidavit of Evidence -in-Chief, which \nstates that the AGM audio recordings are and were at all material times under the custody \nand control of the managing agent and that they were never under the custody and control \nof the Respondent s. Thus, the R espondent s submitted that the AGM audio recording \ncannot be said to be \u2018in the custody or under the control of the management corporation\u2019  \nas required under section 47(1)(b)(viii) of the BMSMA or \u2018 in the possession or under the \ncontrol of the organisation \u2019 as requi red under section 21(1)(a)  of the PDPA.  \n \n25. The Respondent s also submit  that under section 113 of the BMSMA, the Board is not \nmandated to order a management corporation to make available a record or document that \nit had failed to make available for i nspection to the applicant. The Respondent s state that \nit is only where the Board \u201cconsiders\u201d that the Respondent s had \u201c wrongfully (b) failed to \nmake available for inspection\u2026any record or document that, under this Act, he is entitled \nto inspect\u2026 \u201d, may the  board order that the Respondent s supply or make available the \nrecord or document to the Applicant.  \n \n26. The Respondents urges the Board not to exercise its discretion in making available the \nrecord or document for inspection for the following reasons:  \n \n(i) The Re spondent s have already offered the Applicant to listen to the AGM audio \nrecording;  \n(ii) The Respondent s are not entitle d under the BMSMA to make copies of the AGM \naudio recording;  \n(iii) The subsidiary proprietors who attended the AGM and who may be identified would \nnot have consented to the AGM audio recording being used for any purpose other Timothy Siah Yang Tek   STB No .82 of 2017 ( Balestier Point ) \nv 28th Management Council to MCST 1420  \n7 \n than the recording of their attendance at the AGM and identification of proposer \nand seconder for the resolutions which need to be passed at the AGM; and  \n(iv) To guard against the hig h likelihood and reasonable expectation that personal data \nof other subsidiary proprietors may be revealed in the process.  \n \nBOARD\u2019S DECISION  \n \n27. Both the Applicant  and Respondents cited  the previous Strata Titles Boards case of Tan \nHee Chye , albeit with different interpretations . Having considered the subm issions from \nboth the Applicant  and the Respondents, the Board rejects  the Respondents\u2019 proposed  \ndistinction between the words \u2018records\u2019 and \u2018documents\u2019  under section 47 of the \nBMSMA . \n \n28. It is not disputed  that under  section 47(4) of the BMSMA , a person who is entitled to \ninspect a document may take extracts from, or make a copy of th at document. With  \nreference to the Strata Titles Boards decision in Tan Hee Chye  and by construing sect ion \n47(4) of the BMSMA in the context of section 47 BMSMA, the Board agrees with the \nApplicant\u2019s  submission that the Respondent s\u2019 proposed distinction between the words \n\u2018records\u2019 and \u2018documents\u2019 is by its nature, artificial.  In the Board\u2019s view, the case o f Tan \nHee Chye  should be followed  and the AGM audio recording must logically fall within the \ndefinition of a \u2018 document \u2019.  \n \n29. The Board notes that section 11 of the BMSMR only provides for the fees payable to a \nmanagement corporation based on the rate of 50 c ents per copied page. Nevertheless, the \nBoard is of the view  that the Respondents\u2019  narrow  interpretation of the  wording s in section \n11 of the BMSMR should not be employed as a basis for disallowing the Applicant to \nobtain a copy of the AGM audio recording.  Despite the absence of a prescribed fee to \nmake copies of an audio recording, the Respondent s are not in any way prohibited from \nmaking a copy of the AGM audio recording by charging  a reasonable fee.  \n \nNATURE OF SECTION  47 AND  113 BMSMA  \n \n30. Having considered  the case of Tan Hee Chye  and the imperative nature of the word \u2018 shall \u2019 \nunder section 47(1) of the BMSMA, the Board finds that the management corporation is \nunder a mandatory obligation to make available for inspection any record or document in \nthe custody  or under the control of the management corporation upon a written application \nby an applicant  and on payment of a prescribed fee . In accordance with  section 47(4) of \nthe BMSMA, this mandatory obligation extends to the making of copies of such a \ndocument . \n \n31. The B oard agrees with the Respondent s\u2019 view  that under section 113 of the BMSMA, the \nBoard is given the discretion to order a relevant party to supply or make available the \ninformation, record or document to an applicant if the Board considers such inform ation, \ndocument or record was wrongfully withheld from the applicant or that a party had Timothy Siah Yang Tek   STB No .82 of 2017 ( Balestier Point ) \nv 28th Management Council to MCST 1420  \n8 \n wrongfully failed to make such information available for inspection by the applicant or \nhis agent.  \n \n32. The concurrent reading of sections 47(1) and 113 of  the BMSMA provi des a clear \nindication as to the dynamics  and application  of the two sections. It is clear from the \nreading  of section 47(1) of the BMSMA that an applicant is not required , in his written \napplication,  to inform the management corporation (or as the case ma y be) of his  reasons \nfor requesting  such information, document or record. This is the nature of the mandatory \nobligation placed upon the management corporation under section 47(1).  \n \n33. Where a management corporation fails to make available for inspection (section 43(1) \nBMSMA) or fails to provide the applicant with an extract or copy of the document \n(section 43(4) BMSMA), the applicant  may make  an application to the Strata Titles \nBoards under section 113 of the BMSMA . It is then for the constituted Board to decide \npursuant to its discretion under section 113 of the BMSMA, whether a management \ncorporation had wrongfully withheld or failed to make available such information, record \nor document to the applicant.  If the Board is satisfied that the information was not \nwrongfully withheld or that the management corporation did not wrongfully failed to \nmake available any record or document, the Board has the discretion not to exercise its \npower under section 113 of the BMSMA.  \n \n34. The Applicant had  by a letter dated 29 August 2017 and  through his solicitors, M/s Lee \n& Lee, wrote to the Respondents requesting to inspect and take copies of the audio \nrecording of the AGM. Pursuant to section 47 of the BMSMA, the Respondents were \nunder a ma ndatory obligation to allow the Applicant to inspect and take copies of the \nAGM audio recording. The Applicant subsequently clarified in his submissions that he \nhad requested to takes copies of the AGM recordings as \u201c he was unable to be present at \nthe AGM on 22 July 2017 where there was a discussion on income generated from parking \nwithin the development .\u201d \n \nPERSONAL DATA PROTECTION ACT  2012  \n \n35. In the course of the proceedings, it was eviden t that the position s taken by the Respondents \nregarding the legal impl ications of the PDPA were  inconsistent. At paragraph 37 of the \nRespondents\u2019 submission s, the Respondents stated that an \u201c audio recording is taken to \ncontain personal data if an individual can be identified from that audio recording, or from \nthat recording and other information that the organisation has  or is likely to have access \nto\u201d and as a result of that, copies of the AG M recordings cannot be provided as to do so  \nwould be a breach of the PDPA.  \n \n36. By contrast, the Respondents were willing to allow the Applicant to inspect the AGM \nrecording under section 47 of the BMSMA  as reflected by the letter dated 5 S eptember \n2017 to the  Applicants, despite the fact that subsidiary proprietors  may also be at risk of \nbeing identified if the Applicant wa s given the opportunity to listen to the AGM recording. Timothy Siah Yang Tek   STB No .82 of 2017 ( Balestier Point ) \nv 28th Management Council to MCST 1420  \n9 \n As such, it is difficult to appreciate the fine distinction drawn by the Respondent s in the \nabove two situations regarding the protection of an individual\u2019 s personal data.  \n \n37. Having considered the PDPA concerns of the Respondents, t he Board is of the view that  \nthe Respondents\u2019 contention as to a subsidiary proprietor \u2019s personal data protec tion in the \nabove two situations are inconsistent with one another.  \n \n38. Moreover, in (1) Exceltec Property Management Pte Ltd; (2) Management Corporation \nStrata Title Plan No 2956; (3) Strata Land Property Consultants Pte Ltd  [2017] SGPDPC \n8, the Personal Data Protection Commission decided at [37] that \u201c the names, unit \nnumbers, and voting shares of the residents\u2026are publicly available information under \nthe PDPA .\u201d The Commission\u2019s decision was based on the fact that such inform ation can \nbe found in the strata roll, which is generally available to the public and that there were \nfew restrictions under the BMSMA for a person to gain access to the strata roll.  \n \n39. In light of the above, the Board finds that section 47 of the BMSMA does  not, in any \nmanner, contradict the provisions in the PDPA as information relating to subsidiary \nproprietors are considered publicly available pursuant to section 17(3) of the PDPA and \nParagraph 1(d) of the Fourth Schedule of the PDPA.  \n \nCUSTODY AND CONTROL  \n \n40. Both the Respondents and the managing agent of the development, Richard contended \nthat at no time were the AGM recordings \u201c ever under the custody and control of the \nRespondent \u201d. The Board notes that during the cross -examination of Richard, he  had stated \nthat the AGM recordings were currently under his custody and control. However, w hen \nquestioned as to  whether the Respondents would ever obtain  custody and control of the \nAGM recordings, Richard indicated that the  AGM  recording would be given to the \nRespondents upon its request . \n \n41. Having considered Richard\u2019s response, it is indisputable that while the AGM recording \nwas not under the custody of the Respondents, it was undoubtedly under the control of \nthe Respondents. It was clear from Richard\u2019s response  that the Respondents would be \ngiven the AGM recording if they  had requested for it.  \n \n42. The Board accordingly orders that the Respondents supply the Applicant a copy of the \naudio recording of the AGM  held on 22nd July 2017 , pursuant to section 47(4) of the \nBMSMA. As there is no prescribed fee for  making a copy of the  AGM audio recording, \nthe Board orders that the Respondents may charge a reasonable fee not exceeding \nS$300.00.  \n \n \n \n Timothy Siah Yang Tek   STB No .82 of 2017 ( Balestier Point ) \nv 28th Management Council to MCST 1420  \n10 \n 43. The Board orders that the Respondent s pay the Applica nt costs as follows:  \n \n(i) Costs of S$5,000.00 ; \n(ii) Reimbursement of all fees payable to the STB  for the sum of S$1 ,100.00 , being \napplication fee, hearing  fee and fee for delivery of decision ; and  \n(iii) Reasonable disbursements .  \n \n \n \nDated this 5th day of April  2018  \n \n \n \n \n \n       MR ALFONSO ANG  \n       President  \n \n \n \n        \n       MS ELAINE CHEW  \n       Member  \n \n \n \n        \n       DR TAN TENG HOOI  \n       Member  \n \n \n Mr Daniel Chen (M/s Lee & Lee) for the Applicant.  \nMs Valerie Ang / Mr Hiren Jonas (M/s Straits Law) for the Respondent s.

This is a matter concerning inter-floor water leakage where the Applicants alleged that  \nowing to the faulty water pipes of the Respondents\u2019 unit, water seeped into their unit \nand caused significant damage to the structure and fixtures of their unit.\n4. The Applicants seek an order that the Respondents pay a sum of S$3,000.00 being the \ncosts to rectify the damage to their property as evidenced by a quotation from the \nApplicants\u2019 contractor, Aspen Design Studio Pte Ltd (\u201cAspen\u201d), dated 15 March 2017. \nThe following are the alleged defects that require rectification and the quotation for the \nrepairs by Aspen: -\nS/No.  Renovation Work  T/Price (S$)  \n(1) Supply labour & material to dismantle existing cabinet at \nkitchen . 350.00  \n(2) Supply labour & material to disconnect existing sink.  100.00  \n(3) Design & fabricate  L5ft bottom cabinet at kitchen.  800.00  \n(4) Supply labour &  material to install L5ft solid surface \nwork top at kitchen.  500.00  \n(5) Supply labour & material to connection for inlet/outlet for \nkitchen sink.  250.00  \n(6) Supply labour & material to repair existing ceiling at \nkitchen.  500.00  \n(7) Supply labour & mater ial to paint with ICI/Nippon paint \nat kitchen.  500.00  \nGrand Total:  3,000.00  \nApplicants\u2019 Case  \n5. The Applicants gave their evidence through Soh Kah Wah  (\u201cSoh\u201d)  and the Tenant .[Soh Kah Wah @ Vincent Leow  / Chong Lay Kee    STB 52 of 2017 - Eastvale  \nv Lee Cheng Hong  / Ong Ah Tim @ Wong Moi Moi]  \nPage 4 of 8 6. The Applicant s relied on a letter  dated 7 March 2017  from the manageme nt corporation\nto the Respondents and  copied  the said letter  to the Respondents  as one of the basis of\ntheir claim. In that letter , the managing agent highlighted  to the Respondents \u2019 attention\nthat there was water seepage to the Applicants\u2019 unit and  that \u201c during inspection, we\nfound that it is highly probable  case of inter -floor seepage\u201d. Other than this short\nconclusion , the letter delved into the provisions concerning water seepage under the\nBuilding Maintenance and Strata Management Act  (BMSMA), Chapter 30C.\n7. The Applicants also relied on their own belief that the water seepage  must have\nemanated from the Respondents\u2019 unit and thus the presumption  under Section 101(8) of\nthe BMSMA , is raised .\n8.The follo wing are the events in  chronological order  as adduced by the Applicants.\n9. On 29 January 2017 , the Tenant obser ved water leaking into the unit  from the kitchen\nceiling  and informed the Applic ants the next day.  The Respondents  were told of the\nwater leakage during an inspection attended by  both the Applicants and the\nRespondents, and the Respondents  insisted on getting their own contractors  to rectify\nthe leakage .\n10.During a visit to the ir unit  on 10 February 2017,  the Applicants  noticed that water was\nconstantly trickling down  from the kitchen ce iling and onto the ca binet and kitchen\ncounter top. This was b rought to the attention of the Respondents  who denied that the\nwater seepage emanate d from their unit and that they were  responsible .\n11.The Tenant confirmed that sometime in the last week of  February 2017, the\nRespondents \u2019 plumbers visited the unit and inspected the areas affected by  the water\nseepage in the kitchen and service balcony. The Respondents were alleged to have\nconfirmed  that the water seepage emanated from their toilet pipeline. In the meantime,\nthe Respondents had informed the Applicants that they had fixed the water leakage by\nreplacing the defective toilet pipes in their unit.[Soh Kah Wah @ Vincent Leow  / Chong Lay Kee    STB 52 of 2017 - Eastvale  \nv Lee Cheng Hong  / Ong Ah Tim @ Wong Moi Moi]  \nPage 5 of 8 12.On 6  March 2017, water continued to seep through  the Applicants\u2019  kitchen ceiling\nboard and the ceiling board was in danger of  collapsing.\n13.On 7 March 2017 , the Tenant informed the Applicants  that a portion of the c eiling\nboard in the kitchen area had collapsed onto the kit chen floor. The exposed existing\nwater pipe above the kitchen ceiling wit hin the Applicants'  unit was observed to be\nleaki ng with water trickling slowly but constantly.\n14.On 11 March 2017, a plumber engaged by the Applicants  replaced the leaking pipe\nabove the kitchen cei ling with a new pipe.  After the replacement, there was no more\nwater leakage.\n15. On 15 March 2017, Aspen gave a quotation to carry out the rectification work on the\nApplicants\u2019 premises.\nRespondents \u2019 Case  \n16. The Respondents gave evidence through Lee Cheng Hong  (\u201cLee\u201d) , his daughter , Lee\nSu Min , and a con tractor , Goh Kai Hock  of Poh Huat Contractor .\n17. Lee did  not dispute that on 30  January 2017 he was informed by the Applicants that\nthere was water leakage to their p remises. However , when he examined the ceiling\nboard at the Applicants\u2019 kitchen which  was \u201cd arkened\u201d , he asserted that from his\nexperience and knowledge of being  a Master Degree holder in Eng ineering\nManagement , it was  Soh\u2019s pipe that was leaking.\n18. On 31 January 2017, Lee went to the management office to obtain the assistance of the\nmanaging age nt officer to check the pipes.\n19. On 8  February 2017 , the managing agent informed  Lee that there was  a water leakage\nin his service balcony toilet pipe.   Lee maintained that his service balcony re mained dry\nand there was no tell -tale sign such as de -coloura tion due to water leakage on the wall.\nHowever,  he agreed to repair them as he intended to stay in his unit for the long term.[Soh Kah Wah @ Vincent Leow  / Chong Lay Kee    STB 52 of 2017 - Eastvale  \nv Lee Cheng Hong  / Ong Ah Tim @ Wong Moi Moi]  \nPage 6 of 8 20. On 20  February 2017 , Lee\u2019s contractor , Poh Huat Contractor , replaced his service\nbalcony toilet pipe and ran them outside the w all so that he could easily spot any water\nleakage. He said that out of goodwil l he offered to paint the Applicants\u2019 kitchen wall\nand the ceiling board but was unable to do so as the kitchen wall wa s still wet on 24\nFebruary 2017 when he inspected it.  Lee paid his contractor $950 and according to the\ncontactor he is still waiting to paint the Applicants\u2019 kitchen and  the ceiling board.\n21. On 8 March 2017, the ceiling board above the kitchen in the Applicants \u2019 unit collapsed .\nThe Respondents  went to the Applic ants\u2019 unit accompanied by the condominium\nmanager to look at the water leaking problem that caused the collapse . They  found that\nthe water leakage was from a copper pipe belonging to the Applicants above the ceilin g\nboard in the kitchen area .\n22. The discove ry of this leaking copper pipe  above the kitchen area in the Applicants \u2019 unit\nwas only found and confirmed on 8 March 2017 but  Lee maintained that it probably\nhad already been leaking before 8 March 2017.\n23. The Applicants  confirmed that there had been no  report of water leakage after his\nplumber replaced the leaking copper pipe above the kitchen area on 10  March 2017.\nBoard\u2019s Decision and Order  \n24. The Board examined all the evidence and submissions from the Applicants  and\nRespondents . No independent surveyo r was appointed  by either party to conduct a site\ninspection , survey the affected areas (especially the service bal cony a rea) and report on\nthe probable cause of the water seepage . Furth ermore, no water ponding test was\ncarried out to check on the integrit y and water -tightness at the affected areas  by the\nRespondents after they carried out the rectification work .\n25. Both parties relied on their own perception as to what caused the  water  seepage . The\nApplicant s relied on the presumption (which they are entitl ed to) that the upper unit is[Soh Kah Wah @ Vincent Leow  / Chong Lay Kee    STB 52 of 2017 - Eastvale  \nv Lee Cheng Hong  / Ong Ah Tim @ Wong Moi Moi]  \nPage 7 of 8 liable. The Respondents relied on his own professional opinion that the water seepage \ncould not possibly be from  his unit.   \n26. The Board had no assistance from any party. What is clear is th at there appears to be 2\nsources  of water seepage: one possibly from the Respondents\u2019 unit and the other which\nwas definitely from the Applicants\u2019 own unit.  The Board does not accept the bare\nassertion evidence from Lee that it was impossible for  the water leakage in the\nApplicants\u2019 unit to ha ve emanated from his unit . To that extent, they have not rebutted\nthe presumption  under section 101(8) of the BMSMA . The 2nd water leakage was\nclearly the Applicants\u2019 responsibility .\n27. However,  to what extent did the first water leakage, if it came from th e Respondents\u2019\nunit, cause  the damage to the Applicants\u2019 unit is not known. It is also not know n when\nthe 2nd water leakage which was discovered only on 8 March 2017 started and the\nextent of damage the 2nd water leakage caused.\n28. The Applicant s had failed  to prove that all the damage they now claim can be solely\nattributed to the Respondents . There was no evidence as to whether the damage caused\nwas attributed to the 1st or 2nd water leakage.\n29. The Board according ly order s that the Respondent s make good the  ceiling board and\npaint the wall of the Applicants\u2019 kitc hen which he had intended to do in any case within\n30 days from th is order.\n30. The other claims by the Applicant s are not proven to be caused by the Respondents and\nhence , disallowed. The claims are a s follows: -\n(i) to dismantle the existing cabinet at the kitchen ;\n(ii) to design and fabricate the bottom cabinet at the kitchen ;\n(iii) to install a solid sur face work top at the kitchen ; and\n(iv) to connect the inlet/outlet for kitchen .[Soh Kah Wah @ Vincent Leow  / Chong Lay Kee    STB 52 of 2017 - Eastvale  \nv Lee Cheng Hong  / Ong Ah Tim @ Wong Moi Moi]  \nPage 8 of 8 31.

The Applicant, Poon Meng Jin Dennis, is the subsidiary proprietor of Unit #XXX\n(\u201cApplicant\u2019s  Unit \u201d) at the  residential  strata  development  known  as Florence  Regency \nand the Respondents, Teo Oh and Tan Thiam Teck (the \u201cRespondents\u201d) are subsidiary \nproprietors of #XXX (\u201cRespondents\u2019  Unit\u201d). This is a matter concerning inter-floor \nleakage where the Applicant relied on the presumption of liability in section 101(8) of the \nBuilding  Maintenance  and Strata  Management Act,  Chapter  30C  (\u201cBMSMA \u201d) that the \nunit above is responsible for such a leak.\nBACKGROUND \n2. The Applicant moved into his Unit in December 2016.  Renovation works were carried\nout from October 2016 \u2013 December 2016 before the Applicant moved in. The Applicant\u2019s\nappointed contractor first noticed the leaks emanating from the common toilet of the\nRespondents\u2019 Unit into the Applicant\u2019s master bedroom toilet during a pre-work routine\ninspection in October 2016.\n3. The Applicant notified the management corporation (the \u201c MCST \u201d), who wrote to the\nRespondents on numerous occasions (from 14 November 2016 \u2013 19 March 2017). The\nRespondents were informed to take necessary steps to arrest the leakage from their Unit.\nWhile the Respondents made some attempts to rectify the leak, the leakage persisted.\n4. On 16 March 2017, the Applicant filed an application dated 12 March 2017 and sought\nthe following orders under section 101 of the BMSMA against the Respondents:\n\u201c (1)  Repair the interfloor seepage between our Units\n(2) Pay for the damages that have been caused by this leakage\n(3) Pay for the legal and other administration costs relating to the filing of this\napplication.   \u201d\n5. The parties attended 3 mediation sessions before the Board on 4 May 2017, 1 June 2017\nand 20 June 2017. At the first mediation, the Board suggested and the parties agreed thatPoon Meng Jin Dennis   STB No. 16 of 2017 [Florence  Regency] \nv Teo Oh & Tan Thiam Teck   \n4 \n the Respondents engage an independent expert to inv estigate the leak and recommend \nremedial measures if necessary.  The expert\u2019s repor t was to be binding on both parties.  \nThe appointed independent expert is a professional engineer, Engineer Wong Yew Fai ( the \n\u201cExpert \u201d) who did two rounds of investigations. The Expert \u2019s first investigation (from 22 \nMay 2017 \u2013 29 May 2017) found a leak from the Respo ndents\u2019 Unit. His second \ninvestigation (from 3 Jul 2017 \u2013 8 Jul 2017) found no leakage during that investigation.  \nBoth parties were unable to settle the matter throu gh mediation. The dispute then \nproceeded to hearing on 4 August 2017. \n \n6.  The Expert submitted 3 reports in all.  The first w as dated 28 May 2017, after the first \nround of investigation (\u201c 1st  Report \u201d). The second dated 2 July 2017 was labelled \n\u201cSupplementary Report\u201d.  The third dated 14 July 20 17 was submitted after the second \nround of investigation (\u201c 2nd  Report \u201d).  Copies of these reports were included in the \naffidavits of both the Applicant and the Respondent s. \n \n7.  In the 1 st  Report, the Expert described the investigative pro cedure he adopted and \nconfirmed that water from the Respondents\u2019 Unit had  leaked into the Applicant\u2019s Unit \nduring the test and showed up as droplets in the ce iling around the waste pipe. He thus \nconcluded that there was water leakage from the Res pondents\u2019 Unit to the Applicant\u2019s \nUnit. He recommended that the leakage could be fixe d by PU injection into the ceiling \naround the waste pipe.  However, if this did not st op the leak, the problem could be in the \nwaste pipe itself which should then be replaced. \n \n8.  The Expert\u2019s Supplementary Report dated 2 July 2017  was simply a response to the \nrequest made in the Board\u2019s letter of 21 June 2017 (vide copy at AW-1 PMJ-1 pages 1 & \n2) for clarity on the ownership of the pipes he was  referring to in his 1 st  Report.  The \nSupplementary Report clarified that the pipes in qu estion are discharge pipes connecting \nto the Respondents\u2019 toilet bowl and floor trap and therefore are not common property \nunder the MCST.  At the hearing, the Expert confirm ed that the pipes serve the \nRespondents exclusively and belong to the Responden ts. Poon Meng Jin Dennis   STB No. 16 of 2017 [Florence  Regency] \nv Teo Oh & Tan Thiam Teck   \n5 \n  \n9.  Although the Board\u2019s letter was issued to the parti es on 21 June 2017, the Expert was \nengaged by the Respondents to undertake the 2 nd  investigation only much later, on 1 July \n2017.  Besides producing the Supplementary Report o n 2 July 2017, he made 3 new visits \nto the subject Units, on 3, 5 and 8 July 2017 and p roduced the 2 nd  Report dated 14 July \n2017.   \n \n10.  In the 2 nd  investigation, despite flushing the Respondents\u2019 t oilet and running the tap at the \nbasin outside the toilet and also splashing the toi let floor with water by hosing the areas \naround the floor trap, he could not see any water l eaking to the ceiling below, unlike the \noutcome in the 1 st  investigation.  He recorded his finding accordingl y, i.e., no leakage \nvisible at the time of his 2 nd  investigation.  The Expert was unable to say if th e water path \nthat clearly existed for water to leak through duri ng the first investigation had been \nrectified, as he had no information if any rectific ation had been undertaken by anybody \nsince his first investigation.  The conclusion in h is first investigation that there was water \nleaking from the Respondents\u2019 Unit into the Applica nt\u2019s Unit still hold. \n \n11.  The Expert stated in his 2 nd  Report that he wanted to do a ponding test as part  of his 2 nd  \ninvestigation but his request for a ponding test wa s rejected by the Respondents.  Under \nquestioning by the Board during the hearing, the Ex pert clarified that without doing the \nponding test, he could not be sure that the waterpr oof membrane was still intact. Although \nleakage appeared to have stopped at the time of the  2 nd  investigation, he could not be sure \nthat there was no more water path for water to leak  through in future because such water \npath was clearly present during the 1 st  investigation.  In the absence of visible leak dur ing \nthe 2 nd  investigation, he recorded that as a fact. He was not aware that the Respondents \nhad sometime between his 1 st  investigation and the 2 nd  investigation used a product called \n\u201ccement water plug\u201d to somehow seal the leak.  He h ad not seen any obvious sign of \nrectification work being done by the Respondents as  there was no visible alteration to the \nfloor tiles.  In his view, the probability of futur e leaks is very high. \n Poon Meng Jin Dennis   STB No. 16 of 2017 [Florence  Regency] \nv Teo Oh & Tan Thiam Teck   \n6 \n APPLICANT\u2019S CASE \n12.  In his affidavit (\u201c AW1 \u201d) and at the hearing, the Applicant, who appeared in person, \nclaimed that the leakage in his master bedroom toil et emanating from the Respondents\u2019 \nUnit caused severe damage to the false ceiling and electrical fixtures in the master \nbedroom toilet such that his family was not able to  use the toilet since February 2017. A \ndoor stop mounted on the false ceiling had fallen o ff due to the leakage and water had on \none occasion gushed out from the ceiling light posi ng an electrical safety issue to his \nfamily.  (Vide photo at AW-1 PMJ-1 page 19 annotate d with the date 1 March 2017).  \n \n13.  Sometime in February 2017, at the recommendation of  the managing agent, the \nRespondents had appointed a contractor, Maxbuild Gr oup Pte Ltd (\u201c Maxbuild \u201d) to rectify \nthe leak. The Applicant submitted that Maxbuild car ried out PU grouting works twice on \n27 February 2017 and 2 March 2017. It was further s ubmitted that during the second \nround of PU injection, Maxbuild had to remove the A pplicant\u2019s affected false ceiling as \npart of the procedure. Maxbuild informed the Applic ant that the Respondents were aware \nof the procedure, and would take immediate steps to  reinstate the false ceiling. \n \n14.  The Applicant asserted that the rectification works  were unsuccessful as the leak resumed \nshortly after both instances of PU grouting works. \n \n15.  On or about 7 March 2017, Maxbuild carried out a wa ter ponding test. The Applicant \nclaimed that he was informed by Maxbuild that the p onding test had failed (i.e. leakage \nwas detected). On the same day, the MCST locked up the Respondents\u2019 toilet with the \nRespondents\u2019 consent, in order to prevent further l eak through usage. The Applicant \ncontended that the Respondents\u2019 claim that the pond ing test was successful was untrue. \n \n16.  The Applicant\u2019s case is that in the 1 st  Report, the Expert had found from his 1 st  \ninvestigation, leakage from the Respondents\u2019 Unit i nto his Unit and recommended \nrectification works.  He found the rephrasing by th e Expert in his Supplementary Report Poon Meng Jin Dennis  STB No. 16 of 2017 [Florence Regency] \nv Teo Oh & Tan Thiam Teck \n7 somewhat confusing and felt that the Expert appeared \u201cunable to ascertain for certain the \ncause of the leakage from unit #XXX to #XXX.\u201d  He was perplexed by how the Expert \ncould conclude in his final report (the 2nd Report) that there was no leakage when he was \ndenied the ponding test he requested.  Nevertheless, in  summar y, he asserted that based \non his detailed submission, the Expert\u2019s reports and the circumstances, \u201cthe Respondents \nhave  failed  to show  proof  to the contrary  that the leakage  did not seep from the \nRespondents \u2019 unit into my unit.\u201d \nRESPONDENTS\u2019 CASE \n17. The Respondents highlighted that prior to the Applicant moving into Unit #XXX, the \nlatter had done extensive renovations.\n18. The Respondents contended that the extent of leak was not as serious as the Applicant \nstated it to be, given that they had only observed \u201cwater droplets\u201d contrary to the \nApplicant\u2019s description of the leakage as \u201cgushes of water\u201d.  They alleged that the gush \nof water from the ceiling light could be from the Applicant\u2019s own water pipe hidden in \nthe false ceiling space.\n19. The Respondents argued that they had made attempts to resolve the leak from the time \nthey were first informed by the Applicant\u2019s renovation contractors and the MCST \nsometime on or about end October 2016. In this respect, the Respondents supported their \nclaim of rectification effort with Maxbuild\u2019s PU grouting works in March 2017 and also \nthe 1st Respondent\u2019s \u201cwater plug cement\u201d works sometime between 29 May 2017 and 3 \nJuly 2017. The Respondents also submitted that they cooperated by agreeing to lock their \ncommon toilet and plug the sink situated outside the toilet, till the leak was resolved.Poon Meng Jin Dennis  STB No. 16 of 2017 [Florence Regency] \nv Teo Oh & Tan Thiam Teck \n8 20. D uring the course of the hearing, the 1st Respondent explained that he rejected the\nExpert\u2019s request to do ponding test as not necessary because the leak had ceased by the\ntime of the Expert\u2019s second inspection.\n21. Counsel for the Respondents alluded to the fact that since the leak had stopped, this is\nproof of rectification by the Respondents.\nBOARD\u2019S FINDINGS \n22. Having considered the submissions and evidence presented at the hearing, the Board\nmakes the following findings of fact:\ni\n. Leakage emanating from the Respondents\u2019 Unit\n23. T here is ample evidence in the many photos and letters sent by the MCST to the\nRespondents to establish signs of water seepage from the Respondents\u2019 Unit into the\nApplicant\u2019s Unit which is directly below.  The Expert after investigation confirmed that\nindeed there was visible leakage from the common toilet of the Respondents\u2019 Unit to the\nmaster bedroom toilet of the Applicant\u2019s Unit. Pursuant to section 101(8) of the BMSMA,\nthe Respondents are deemed responsible for the leak, as the Expert\u2019s confirmation that\nthere was a leak puts it beyond refute.  The Respondents had admitted that their property\nhad caused leakage in the form of water droplets but denied responsibility for the\n\u201cgushing\u201d of water streaming from the ceiling light.  (Vide RW-2 Page 11 [38]).\nii.Expert\u2019s Reports and Testimony\n24. T he Board accepts the Expert\u2019s reports and opinion on the matters dealt with.  Through\ninvestigative testing, the Expert had established there was leakage from the Respondents\u2019 \nUnit into the Applicant\u2019s ceiling at or around the Respondents\u2019 discharge pipe. This meansPoon Meng Jin Dennis  STB No. 16 of 2017 [Florence Regency] \nv Teo Oh & Tan Thiam Teck \n9 that there was at least one water path causing the l eakage that needed to be fixed.  The \nExpert saw no fresh leak during his second investigation but could not determine why and \nhow the leak had stopped. He was not given any information if any remedial work had \nbeen undertaken by the Respondents. Further, he was denied the opportunity to conduct \nan industry standard ponding test to check for watertightness. Without the ponding test, \nhe could not verify that there was no more water path that may cause leakage.  As he was \nnot told of any remedial works being done, he was of the view that the probability of \nfuture leaks is very high.  The Applicant had noted this with concern in his closing \nsubmission and expressed no confidence that the problem had been fixed. The Board \naccepts this as a valid concern. \n25. To questions by the Board, the Expert also expressed the view that the isolated incident\ninvolving the stream of water \u201cgushing\u201d from the ceiling light was due to accumulated\nleakage water on the false ceiling which eventually gave way. He also said that he did not\nsee any water supply pipe in the toilet ceiling. The Respondents\u2019 suggestion that the water\ncame from the Applicant\u2019s own defective supply pipe is therefore incorrect.  The Board\nalso perused the sanitary plan (in particular section 1.1) submitted by the Respondents.\nNo water pipe was shown running in the ceiling space below the Respondents\u2019 common\ntoilet.\ni\nii.No leakage as at hearing date\n26. T he Applicant confirmed that there was no leakage since the time of the Expert\u2019s 2nd\ni\nnvestigation.  It was only at the hearing on 4 August 2017 that the 1st Respondent\ndisclosed that he had applied a \u201cwater plug cement\u201d to seal the leakage. He declared that\nhe has been in the building industry for a long time and was 100% sure it will not leak\nagain after his intervention.  The Board notes that there was no mention of any action\nbeing taken by the Respondents in their AEIC.  The Board is disappointed that the\nRespondents had withheld information on the rectification work from the Expert, the\nApplicant and the Board until he was cross-examined.  In the circumstances, there is noPoon Meng Jin Dennis  STB No. 16 of 2017 [Florence Regency] \nv Teo Oh & Tan Thiam Teck \n10 merit in their submission that the Applicant ought n ot to have proceeded to hearing when \nleakage had stopped. \n27. The Respondents claimed to have applied the sealant sometime between the Expert\u2019s 1st\na\nnd 2nd investigation.  However, the Applicant pointed out that during that period, the\nRespondents\u2019 toilet was supposed to be locked by the MCST and inaccessible.  The 1st\nR\nespondent claimed that he had resumed using the toilet after the Expert\u2019s 2nd\ni\nnvestigation. He had also said that he \u201cused the water very little\u201d.  He provided no\ninformation on how and where he had applied his \u201cwater plug cement\u201d but only offered\nto show samples of the material to the Board.  Specialized material would normally\nrequire proper application in accordance with manufacturer\u2019s recommendations and to be\nused in appropriate conditions only.  He was evasive and provided no relevant information\non the rectification. He had not done any ponding test to verify its effectiveness as is\nnormally done in waterproofing repairs in the building industry, a practice which he ought\nto know and implement in view of his emphasis to the Board that he was an old hand.  He\nhad obstructed the Expert in the performance of his investigation by refusing to allow the\nponding test for no good reason.  His rejection of the Expert\u2019s request, simply on the basis\nthat no leakage was seen after water was splashed on the floor, is clearly unreasonable\nand unacceptable.  Splashing water on the floor is not equivalent to a full ponding test.  It\nis uncertain if the leakage had indeed been fixed or if there was little or no water usage\nover the problematic area. In the circumstances, the Expert and the Applicant had good\nreason to be concerned that the leak would recur.\nB\nOARD\u2019S DECISION/ ORDER \n28. T he Board has examined the reports of the Expert and accepted the findings and\ndetermined that the Respondents are responsible for the leakage complained of by the\nApplicant. The Board also recognises that the Respondents had taken some steps to repair\nthe leak and notes that the leak in the Applicant\u2019s master bedroom toilet was not presentPoon Meng Jin Dennis  STB No. 16 of 2017 [Florence Regency] \nv Teo Oh & Tan Thiam Teck \n11 as at the date of hearing.  However, in view of the Board\u2019s findings above, the Applicant \nhas endured considerable inconvenience and deserves better assurance that the \nRespondents had indeed properly discharged their responsibility to stem the leak and that \nthe leak has stopped. \n29. The Board therefore orders as follows:\nThe Respondents shall at their own expense, within 2 weeks from the date hereof, engage\nthe Expert to arrange, direct and supervise a professionally conducted ponding test in\ntheir common toilet.  If the ponding test result is satisfactory (i.e. no leakage arising from\nthe test is detected in the Applicant\u2019s toilet), it shall be accepted that the Respondents\nhave satisfactorily fixed the leak.  However, if the test fails (i.e. leakage arising from the\ntest is detected in the Applicant\u2019s toilet), then the Respondents shall under the supervision\nof the Expert carry out such repair or rectification as may reasonably be specified by the\nExpert to fix the leak.  Upon completion, the Respondents shall conduct another ponding\ntest under the direction and supervision of the Expert to confirm watertightness. The\ninvestigative and rectification process shall be repeated if necessary until the ponding test\nis satisfactory and the leak has ceased.\nB\nOARD\u2019S DECISION ON COSTS \n30. T he Board will now deal with the issue of costs and damages, which will be confined to\nthe prayers sought by the Applicant.\n31. The Applicant submitted that costs and damages in the total of $4,902.60 ought to be\nawarded. This amount includes the cost to reinstate the false ceiling and electrical fittings\nin his master bedroom toilet and the solicitor and client costs which he incurred in the\nengagement of legal services by KSCGP Juris LLP.Poon Meng Jin Dennis  STB No. 16 of 2017 [Florence Regency] \nv Teo Oh & Tan Thiam Teck \n12 32. In view of the finding and conclusion, the Board, in  its discretion, considers that the\nappropriate orders for costs and damages are as follows and here by orders:\n(i) the Respondents shall pay to the Applicant, the amou nt fixed at $4,500.00  to cover\nt\nhe Applicant\u2019s claim ;\n(ii) a ll costs involved in engaging the Expert and the measures to stop the leak shall be\nfully borne by the Responden ts; and\n(iii) the parties are to bear their own costs for the rest of the matter.\nDated this 28th day of September 2017. \nMS LEE LAY SEE \nDeputy President \nMR LEE KEH SAI \nMember \nMR CHUA KOON HOE \nMember \nT\nhe Applicant in person. \nMs Choo Yean Ling/ Ms Rebecca Yeo (M/s Tan Lee & Partners) for the Respondents.

(Deputy President) \nMr Lai Huen Poh   (Member)  \nMr Kong Mun Kwong  (Member)  \nBACKGROUND:  \n1. The Applicant, Wong Rin Rin Christina (WRR) is the subsidiary proprietor of #XXX,  \nPandan Valley Condominium at 5 Pandan Valley Singapore 597629 and the \nRespondents, Cao Vanneau Nathalie Marie Anne (NC) and Cao Minh-Tam Patrick (PC) \nare the subsidiary proprietors of the unit immediately above viz #XXX.\n2. The facts are as follows: (When referring to the source of the water leakage parties, which \naccording to the Applicant emanated from the Respondents\u2019 balcony, the area was at \ntimes referred to as the patio or terrace).[Wong Rin Rin Christina v   STB 10 of 2017 - \nCao Vanneau Nathalie Marie Anne /   Pandan Valley Condominium  \nCao Minh -Tam Patrick ]  \n \nPage 3 of 9 \n 3. On 21 Aug ust 2016, the Applicant  via email informed the Respondents  that water was \nleaking from the Respondents \u2019 terrace into the l iving room and bedrooms of the \nApplicant \u2019s unit and asked when the Respondents  would be  available to view the \ndamage. The Respondents  were informed that the Applicant  was getting her unit ready \nfor her next tenant. Photos showing the leaks were attached.  \n \n4. Parties communicated with each other and on 4  September  2016 , the Respondents  \ninformed that they had asked 4 waterproofing companies to inspect the seepage and \nconfirmed that there was seepage from their patio. They would accordingly redo the \nwaterproofing and tiling in their patio and would also waterproof the external wall inside  \ntheir patio. On 14  September  2016 , the Applicant  thanked the Respondents  for carrying \nout the rectification works and asked if the Respondents  were agreeable to reimbursing \nthe Applicant  $1,000.00 for rectification works  necessitated by the seepage. The \nRespondents  replied that they would get their contractor to do the necessary.  \n \n5. On 1 Oct ober 2016 , the Applicant  informed that work done  (painting)  by the \nRespondents \u2019 contractor  was not satisfactory. She informed that rough patches on walls \nand ceiling had not been attended to and stalactites (referring to uneven patches) were \nnot removed. She asked for work to be properly done by 7 Oc tober  2016 and if it was \nnot done she would g et her own contractor to do the necessary and look to the \nRespondents  for reimbursement. The parties communicated with each other and on 16 \nOctober 2016 , the Applicant  informed that the unit will be handed over to her tenant and \nthere was outstandi ng work to be completed by the Respondents \u2019 contractor.  \n \n6. On 8 Nov ember  2016 the Applicant  informed that water stains and mould had started \nagain and on 10 Nov ember  2016 the Applicant  informed that the water seepage had not \nbeen resolved; that th ere is water drippi ng from the Respondents \u2019 unit; that her walls and \nceiling have turned mouldy; that he r tenant had reported that the Respondents  had \nclaimed that seepage is not from their unit. She asked if the Respondents  would rectify \nand reimburse cost of repair and to reply by 14 Nov ember  2016 . She further informed \nthat if the Respondents  were not prepared to take responsibility, she would be engagi ng \nan expert and would look to Respondents  to pay the costs. She also in formed that her \ntenants were upset and wanted a waiver of rent.  \n \n7. On 12 Nov ember  2016, the Respondents  confirmed their will ingness to rectify if seepage \nwas from their unit and that their contractor had been asked to do another water ponding \ntest.  \n \n8. Accordi ng to the Respondents , water ponding was, because of weather conditions not \ncarried out until the 23 Nov ember  2016 . Flooding for the water ponding test was done \nby NC herself with tools provided by the water proofing specialist that Respondents  had \npreviously engaged. A colour dye was not used when the water ponding test was being \ncarried out because the Respondents  were concerned that a dye could da mage their \nterrace. At 5.00  pm on that day NC sent an email to the Applicant  and inter alia recor ded: [Wong Rin Rin Christina v   STB 10 of 2017 - \nCao Vanneau Nathalie Marie Anne /   Pandan Valley Condominium  \nCao Minh -Tam Patrick ]  \n \nPage 4 of 9 \n  \nWe started today the water ponding test of our terrace. It has been entirely flooded since \nthis morning. The management came to check. We first went to your unit and the \nmanagement officer took photos of the active dripping in the living room along t he \nsliding door as well as the stains and damp areas in the living room and two bedrooms. \nHe will come back tomorrow morning to inspect again your premises. We will see if the \nsituation has worsened or not over 24 hours\u2026.  \n \n9. On 23  November 2016  at 7.43 pm , the Applicant  sent an email to NC and inter alia stated :  \n \nYou yourself have stated in your email that after you flooded your patio, water has \nalready started to drip through to our unit. Our tenant has reported that water has been \nleaking into our unit since you flooded your patio. They recorded it on video. Please see \nattached  \n \n10. On 24 Nov ember 2016,  the Respondents , inter alia informed that it was raining between \n1.45 am and 6.00  am on 23 Nov ember 2016  and the rain stopped before 9.30  am. Before \nflooding  started the Applicant \u2019s unit was inspected and there was active water dripping \nin the living room, along the sliding door as well as damp areas and stains in the living \nroom and bedrooms. Photos were taken before flooding started. On the same day , the \nApplicant  informed that the video recording made by her tenant and forwarded to the \nRespondents  on 23 Nov ember 2016  was recorded at 6.51  pm on 23 Nov ember 2016  (i.e. \n9 hours after flooding commenced); that water was still dripping from the Respondents \u2019 \nbalcony; and asked the Respondents  to confirm that they were not accepting \nresponsibility.  \n \n11. The water ponding test carried out by NC was witnessed by a representative from the \nmanagement corporation (Sai Tong Hseng) . Photos were taken before the tests \ncommenced and 24 hours later. Sai Tong Hseng saw and  the photos taken (at pa ges 276 \nto 281 of ABOD) showed  water continually dripping at the hall wall below and at the \nright side of the fcu (fan coil u nit); at the hall window frame;  at the bedroom ceiling;  \nand continually flowing at the external wall . \n \n12. On 26 Nov ember 2016,  after the Respondents  had maintained that there was no evidence \nthat seepage was from their terrace , the Applicant  informed that she would be engaging \na surveyor and proceeded to appoint Ms. CS Lee & Associates (CSL) .  \n \n13. After CSL were appointed, the Respondents  appointed Ms. CC Building Surveyors \n(CCBS) as their expert. The experts had access to the respective premises before they \nsubmitted their reports.  \n \n14. CSL inspected the Applicant \u2019s pre mises on 3 and 20  December  2016. Readings were \nmade with a Protimeter  Moisture Meter , a two function instrument designed to help in \nthe diagnosis of dampness problems in buildings, and were repeated on 20 Dec ember [Wong Rin Rin Christina v  STB 10 of 2017 - \nCao Vanneau Nathalie Marie Anne / Pandan Valley Condominium  \nCao Minh -Tam Patrick ]  \nPage 5 of 9 2016  to determine  if there was an improvem ent of the conditions between the two \ninspections. CSL reported as follows:  \nApplicant \u2019s Living room  \nFan coil area.  \ni) Stain on right side of fan coil of the air conditioner \u2013 caused by holes left  \nunplugged when brackets for the air con was installed on the external wall.\nii) Stains on left side and the adjacent surface beneath the fan coil unit (water \nobserved oozing out from the wall \u2013 probably originating due to poor \nworkmanship at junction between wall and floor waterproofing works to open \nbalcony of # XXX.\nSliding door between living room and terrace  \niii) The soffit of concrete beam above sliding door \u2013 four locations were saturated\nwith water and two other locations were damp. Pelmet for sliding door visibly\nstained .\nThe wall opposite the fan coil \niv) Water stains on the wall surface .\nEntrance to Bedroom 1 and Master bedroom  \nv) Above the false ceiling there were water stains and paint blisters on the concrete\nceiling. Surface was damp .\nMaster bedroom  \nvi) Ceiling at the entrance to the bedroom was saturated with water .\nvii) False ceiling at corner of bedroom next to sliding door was saturated with water\nviii) Stains on the wall between bedroom and living room. Also very damp .\nBedroom 1  \nix) Water stains on ceiling at left corner .\nx) Stains on the ceiling and the cornice of the wall that separated the two bedrooms\nxi) Stalactites on the concrete soffit (above false ceiling). There was water droplets\non tips on some dripping at rate of one droplet every two minutes. There was\nevidence that pressure grouting was done .[Wong Rin Rin Christina v  STB 10 of 2017 - \nCao Vanneau Nathalie Marie Anne / Pandan Valley Condominium  \nCao Minh -Tam Patrick ]  \nPage 6 of 9 15. CSL\u2019s view was that the stains, other than the stains caused by holes left unplugged when \nbrackets for the air con was installed on the external wall and a leak at the corner of the \nfalse ceiling at the corner of the open terrace outside Bedroom 1 (probably caused by \nleaks in the corner of the terrace belonging to the Applicant) were probably caused by \nwater seepage from #XXX (the water seepages are generally at the edges of the rooms  \ncorresponding to the location of the balcony parapet wall.); the leakage probably \noriginated from poor workmanship at the junction of horizontal water proofing of the \nfloor and vertical water proofing of part of the parapet wall. CSL was of the view that  \nfailure of the water proofing could be reinforced by making a triangular water fillet of \nwater proofing material along the edge of the junction between floor and wall. The \nstalactites were due to water seepage that had travelled laterally.\n16. On 10 February 2017, CSL provided a supplemental report after perusing two  \nphotographs provided by the Applicant showing stains on the ceiling and adjacent walls  \nin one bedroom and the wall next to the air con fan coil unit in the other bedroom. He \nwas of the view that the stain next to the air con fan coil did not emanate from the \nRespondents\u2019 balcony whilst the stains in the other bedroom (which he had not noted \npreviously \u2013 due to the fact that the area was covered by the false ceiling) were similar  \nto the stains that he had observed and commented upon in his earlier report and was due \nto failure of Respondents\u2019 waterproofing works.\n17. CCBS after inspections on 8 December 2016, 18 and 19 January 2017 reported:\n(Applicant \u2019s unit)\ni)on the side internal wall face of the living room there was staining and water damage\n\u2013his explanation for this was rain water egress via adjacent external wall face rain \nwater egress via adjacent external wall face.\nii)at the door head above the sliding doors at the rear of the living room there was \nstaining \u2013 no opinion was expressed as to the cause.\niii)there was active water dripping along a line perpendicular and then parallel to the \nrear elevation of the rear bedroom. The staining ceased in line with the attached  \nbathroom \u2013his explanation was that this was due to a leaking water supply pipe \nbecause there was active dripping during dry weather.\niv)there was moisture present along a line perpendicular to the rear elevation of the \nfurther rear bedroom \u2013 this too was due pipework leakage.\nv)A water ponding test (no colour dye was used) carried out at the \nRespondents\u2019  terrace on 18 and 19 January 2017. There was no evidence that \nwater from the test had leaked into the Applicant \u2019s unit.\n18. Accordingly, it can be noted that there was no agreement between the experts appointed  \nby the parties. CSL was of the view that there is ongoing water seepage in the Applicant \u2019s \nunit emanating from the Respondents\u2019 unit. This is because the water proofing works \nthat was carried out by the Respondents was not effective in stopping the leakage.  \nAdditional works are required and he has described the additional works as follows \u201cThe[Wong Rin Rin Christina v  STB 10 of 2017 - \nCao Vanneau Nathalie Marie Anne / Pandan Valley Condominium  \nCao Minh -Tam Patrick ]  \nPage 7 of 9 failure of the water proofing can be  reinforced by making a triangular water fillet of \nwater proofing material along the edge of the junction between floor and wall .\u201d  CCBS \nis of the view it was due to a le aking water supply pipe in the Applicant \u2019s unit.  \n19. An amicable resolution was not achie ved during mediation and when the matter was\nfixed for an arbitration hearing, the Applicant  indicated that she was also claiming for\nvarious sums of money in connection with the damages caused by the leakage from the\nRespondents \u2019 unit. The various claims are itemized  in AW -1(1).\n20. After the date had been fixed for the arbitration hearing but before the date of the hearing\nthe Applicant , on the 23  of June 2017 arranged for an engineer from a water intrusion\nspecialist company viz Ms. IGM Engineers to check t he water pipes in her premises. His\nfindings were that the water stain marks on the top section of the wall was not due to\nconcealed pipe leakage; it was not likely that there were water supply pipe s in the wall;\nthe stain marks on the concrete ceiling and  side beam of the master bedroom are not due\nto water supply pipes; there was a water supply pipe above the false ceiling of bedroom\n1 that ran towards the toilet of the master bedroom but there were no signs of water\nleakage from the walkway false ceiling /bedroom 1 temporary plywood ceiling i.e . there\nwas no evidence that there was a defe ctive water supply pipe in the Applicant \u2019s premises .\nFINDINGS  \n21. There is no doubt that before water proofing works were carried out by the Respondents \nin September/October 2016 there was, other than the leakage caused by the installation  \nof the metal brackets for the air-con compressor and a leak at the corner of the false \nceiling at the corner of the open terrace outside bedroom 1, water leakage emanating  \nfrom the Respondents\u2019 unit viz the open balcony that was directly above the Applicant \u2019s \nliving room, master bedroom, bedroom 1 and the entrance corridors to the bedrooms. \nWater leakage into the Applicant \u2019s unit continued after the Respondents carried out water \nproofing works.\n22. After considering the evidence of the Applicant and her witnesses viz WRR, her husband \nKoh Peng Chye, her tenant Amrita De La Pena, Sai Tong Hseng, and the findings and \nconclusions of CSL; the evidence of Respondents and their witnesses viz NC, PC and \nthe findings and conclusions of CCBS we are satisfied that the works carried out by the \nRespondents had not effectively arrested the water leakage from the Respondents\u2019  \nbalcony into the Applicant \u2019s unit. We do not accept the evidence and conclusion of  \nCCBS that water leakage in the Applicant \u2019s premises is due to a leaking water supply \npipe.\n23. Accordingly, it is ordered that the Respondents carry out effective and proper repairs and \nwater-proofing works in the Respondents\u2019 unit at 5 Pandan Valley # XXX Singapore \n597629 to stop and prevent all water leakages into the Applicant \u2019s unit at 5 Pandan \nValley #XXX Singapore 597629 within a period of 8 weeks from today. It will be in[Wong Rin Rin Christina v  STB 10 of 2017 - \nCao Vanneau Nathalie Marie Anne / Pandan Valley Condominium  \nCao Minh -Tam Patrick ]  \nPage 8 of 9 order that works be carried out in accordanc e with the recommendations made by CSL \nat paragraph 48 of his report (ABOD \u2013 page 93) .  \n24. As a result  of the water leakage from the Respondents \u2019 unit the Applicant  has suffered\ndamages and  has made a claim as itemized  in AW -1(1).\n25. Other that a denial that the damages w ere caused by leakage from the Respondents \u2019 unit\nthe Respondents  did not, other than alleging that the Applicant  had, since purchasing the\nunit not done any renovations; that the false ceilings were very o ld and in a poor\ncondition; that the o riginal electrical  system was obsolete; and that the Applicant  had not\nmitigated her losses; attempt to challenge the particulars itemized  and the costs for\nrectification.\n26. Due consideration was given as to what should be awarded to the Applicant  and our\nconclusions are as follows:\n27. Rent:\nWith regard to the claim for waiver and loss of rental, we considered the extent of the\nleakage, including the fact that there was a source not emanatin g from the Respondents \u2019\nunit, the general inconven ience endu red by the occupants, and the agreement between the\nApplicant  and the tenants with regard to a 50% waiver. CSL had considered the cost of\nrepairing a unit that is inhabited whi lst repair works are being carried out and the savings\nif the unit was vacated. Rectification works can be carried out without a need for the\npremises to be vacated and w e are of the view that it will not be in order to award  an\namount for 100% loss of rental when remedial works are being carried out. We are of the\nview that a waiver of 25 % ($1 ,450 x 10) from 1 December 20 16 to the date when\nrectifica tion works should be completed - we estimate that all works should be completed\nby end September 2017 - would be in order.\n28. Expenses incurred and to be incurred:\nWith regard to the various sums expended in carrying out temporary electrical works  we\nnoted that whilst they were not unreasonable there would have been some degree of wear\nand tear to the wiring  before any work s were done . It will be in order that wear and tear\nbe consider ed when determining awards for repairs and replacements. It was also noted\nthat CSL had considered earlier works carried when assessing fair and reasonable costs\nfor rectification. We are of the view that it  will be in order to award a global amount in\nconnection with costs for rectification which would include moneys expended and\nmoneys for further necessary works.  After noting the particulars of the various items and\nthe views of CSL we are of the view that i t would be in order to award $30 ,000 as costs\nfor rectification.\n29. We are of the view that it will not be in order to award any reimbursement for restorati on\nof the  tenant\u2019s painting that  was on the wall of the living room. It should not have been\nhung on a wall where there was evidence of water leakag e.[Wong Rin Rin Christina v  STB 10 of 2017 - \nCao Vanneau Nathalie Marie Anne / Pandan Valley Condominium  \nCao Minh -Tam Patrick ]  \nPage 9 of 9 30. Surveyor \u2019s and legal fees:\nWhilst we are of the view that it will be in order for the Respondents  to pay for the cost\nand expenses for CSL\u2019s services,  we did not, in view of the nature of this case consider\nthat any moneys should be awarded to the Applicant  for consulting a lawyer.\n31. STB fees and miscellaneous expenses :\nWe are of the view that it will be in order to award a sum of $1 ,000.00 inclusive of all\nfees payable to Strata Titles Boards (filing and hearing fees) for costs and expenses for\npursuing the claim.\n32. Accordingly, it is ordered that the Respondents  should pay  the Applicant ( $14,500 +\n$30,000 + $3 ,000 + $1 ,000) $48 ,500 for loss and expenses resulting from the leakage.\nDated this 19th day of July 2017  \n________________________  \nREMEDIOS  FRANCIS  G.  \nDeputy President  \n________________________  \nLAI HUEN POH  \nMember  \n________________________  \nKONG MUN KWONG  \nMember  \n The Applicant in person   \nThe Respondents in person  "

Sunglade (Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 2874) is a subdivided \nbuilding with 475 strata lots located at 1 \u2013 13 Ser angoon Avenue 2 Singapore 556130. \nTwenty two (22) subsidiary proprietors (from 12 lot s \u2013 9 on the first floor and 3 on the \nthirteenth floor) applied for an order that they be permitted to install coverings at their \nprivate enclosed spaces and roof trellises in accor dance with the specifications \ndescribed in resolution 10.1 passed at the 11 th  Annual General Meeting of Respondent \non 29 th  May 2016 and in the design shown in the appendix t hereto.  Additionally they \nhave applied for an order for costs. \n2.  The Applicants informed that the orders were being sought pursuant to sections \n101(1)(c) and 111 of the Building Maintenance and S trata Management Act Cap 30C \n(the Act). \nBACKGROUND \n3.  At the 11 th  Annual General Meeting (AGM) on 29 th  May 2016, the following by-law \nwas, by way of a Special Resolution, adopted as Add itional By-laws of MCST Plan \nNo 2874. \n All Subsidiary Proprietors at ground floor (PES) a nd the top floor (Roof Trellis) who \n wish to install coverings must comply with the fol lowing conditions:  \ni.  The width of the PES/Roof Trellis covering shall be  no more than 2 metres from \nthe external wall of the unit unless exempted by UR A  \nii.  The design of the PES/Roof Trellis covering must be  of the approved design in \nAppendix A  \niii.  The design of the PES/Roof Trellis covering must be  certified by a qualified \nperson at resident\u2019s own cost  \niv.  The design of the PES/Roof Trellis must be submitte d for approval by Urban \nRenewal Authority (URA), Building and Construction Authority BCA) and other \nregulatory bodies as may be required at resident\u2019s own cost  Ong Bee Lian & 21 others        STB No 86 of 2016 [ Sunglade] \nv MCST Plan No. 2874    \nPage 4 of 16 \n v.  The PES/Roof Trellis covering will be removed at th e Subsidiary Proprietor\u2019s own \ncost should there be a change of property ownership , unless the new owner \nundertakes the ownership and maintenance of the PES /Roof Trellis covering  \nvi.  The Subsidiary Proprietor will be responsible for p roper maintenance, including \ncleaning the top of the PES/Roof Trellis on a regul ar basis, failing which the \nManagement will engage a cleaning contractor and re cover the cleaning costs \nfrom the Subsidiary Proprietor concerned after due notice is given.  \n4.  Following the passing of the special resolution, th e Applicants requested a meeting \nwith the council and managing agent to discuss the installation of the coverings and \nfollowed up with a request for confirmation that th ey could proceed with the \ninstallation of the coverings. By way of an email o n 9 th  September 2016, the \nRespondent replied that the requests were not appro ved. The reason for disapproval \nwas: \n As discussed in the 4 th  council meeting, we regret to inform you that your  application \n is not approved. It has been confirmed that the tr ellises are common property. In our \n opinion the covering of these trellises by Subsidi ary Proprietors can be referred to S \n 33 \u2013 Exclusive Use By-Laws of the Building Mainten ance and Strata Management Act. \n Hence, a resolution either by 50%, 75% or 90% need s to be passed in a general \n meeting as per S 33(1)(a)(b)(c).  \n5.  By way of a letter dated 14 th  September 2016, the Applicants\u2019 solicitors wrote t o the \nRespondent and took the position that there was no legal basis for the rejection of the \nrequests on the ground that: \na.  The strata title plan drawings of the Applicants lo ts clearly showed that the \ncoverings would be within their lots; \nb.  The special resolution passed at the 11 th  AGM was sufficient to authorise \ninstallation of the coverings even if they are on c ommon property; \nc.  It was incorrect that the installation of the cover ings would constitute exclusive \nuse of common property and even if the trellises we re common property Ong Bee Lian & 21 others        STB No 86 of 2016 [ Sunglade] \nv MCST Plan No. 2874    \nPage 5 of 16 \n installation of the coverings did not allow the App licants to use them exclusively; \nthe Applicants could not set up gardens or deck cha irs on the coverings; and \nd.  The coverings were intended to keep the Applicants and their families safe from \nkiller litter. Pursuant to statutory by-laws under the Building Maintenance (Strata \nManagement) Regulations 2005, the Management Corpor ation could not prevent \nthe Applicants from installing coverings at the gro und floor as a safety device. \n6.  In the Submission By Respondent  (Form 18A), the Respondent informed that the \nintention of the Respondent is to ensure that the p urported approval granted to the \nApplicants by way of the Resolution is valid and re gular. It is not to unreasonably \nprohibit the Applicants from installing coverings o n the Trellises.  \n7.  It will be in order to note that the by-law, other than setting out the specifications and \nconditions that had to be complied with by subsidia ry proprietors before coverings \ncould be installed, did not permit or authorise the  installation of coverings.  \n8.  Following a mediation before the Board on 22 nd  February 2017, the dispute between \nthe subsidiary proprietors of the ground floor lots  and the management corporation \nwas settled. The parties agreed that the installati on of the coverings over the trellises \nby the subsidiary proprietors of the ground floor s trata lots constituted an installation \nof a safety device for the improvement of safety and permission was given by the \nmanagement corporation for the installation of the coverings. \n9.  The Board was unable to resolve the dispute between  the subsidiary proprietors on the \nthirteenth floor and the management corporation and  the matter was fixed for an \narbitration hearing. When parties appeared before t he Board for directions before the \nhearing, the Board was informed that it was not in dispute that the trellises were \ncommon property. The one and only issue for determi nation was whether the \ninstallation of the coverings over the trellises wo uld amount to an exclusive use of \ncommon property. Directions were given for an arbit ration hearing and when the \nwritten submissions were filed, the Applicants\u2019 pos ition with regard to the issues was Ong Bee Lian & 21 others        STB No 86 of 2016 [ Sunglade] \nv MCST Plan No. 2874    \nPage 6 of 16 \n changed. According to the Applicants, the issues fo r determination (AWS \u2013 paragraph \n3) were:  \ni.  Whether installation of coverings over the trellise s amounted to exclusive use of \ncommon property; (in the Applicants\u2019 Reply Submissi ons the issue was reframed \nand became Whether the trellises are used for the installation  of the coverings ) \nii.  If so, then is this the sort of exclusive use that requires a b y-law to be made \npursuant to Section 33 of the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act \n(BMSMA)  \nAPPLICANTS\u2019 SUBMISSIONS: \n10.  In connection with issue i) it was the submission o f the Applicants that there would not \nbe any exclusive use of common property in the inst allation of the coverings because \nthe trellises would not be used in the installation  of the coverings.  \n11.  In connection with issue ii) it was the submission of the Applicants that s.33 of the Act \nis not applicable when exclusive use would not inte rfere unreasonably with the use and \nenjoyment of the common property by other occupiers  or any other person entitled to \nthe use and enjoyment of the common property. The A pplicants submitted that under \ns.63(c) of the Act, subsidiary proprietors can use and enjoy common property in any \nmanner or for any purpose as long as the manner of use and purpose of use does not \ninterfere unreasonably with the use and enjoyment o f common property by the \noccupiers of another lot or others entitled to use and enjoy the common property. In \nview of this right, the power of the management cor poration under s.33 of the Act to \nmake a by-law with regard to exclusive use and spec ial privileges over common \nproperty was limited to granting exclusive use only  in circumstances when such use \ninterfered unreasonably with the use and enjoyment of common property by the \noccupier of another lot or other person entitled to  the use and enjoyment of common \nproperty. It was submitted that the installation th at the Applicants intended to execute \nwould not interfere unreasonably with the use and e njoyment of common property by \nanother occupier or other person entitled to use th e common property and accordingly \nthere was no requirement for the management corpora tion to make a by-law under s.33 Ong Bee Lian & 21 others        STB No 86 of 2016 [ Sunglade] \nv MCST Plan No. 2874    \nPage 7 of 16 \n in connection with the Applicants\u2019 installations. Arthur Laurence Platt v Antonio \nCosimo Ciriello and Lorenza Maria Ciriello [1999] Q CA 33  (Arthur Laurence Platt ) \nwas cited in support of the submission. \n12.  It will be in order to note that it will be necessa ry to make a determination on issue ii) \nonly if the answer to issue i) is not in the Applic ants\u2019 favour. If the Applicants are \ncorrect that common property will not be used in th e installation of the coverings, the \nsituation would be that the Applicants intend to in stall coverings in and within their \nlots. These would be acts that are not in any way u nlawful and/or prohibited by any of \nthe provisions of the Act. It is not clear as to wh y they would want the management \ncorporation to grant permission for such and there was no submission as to where and \nhow the Board had the power to make an order requir ing the management corporation \nto give permission for such. There is no provision in the Act that empowers the Board \nto order the management corporation (or any person)  to give permission to do an act \nthat is not unlawful in any way and which does not require permission from anyone \nbefore it can be done.  \nRESPONDENT\u2019S SUBMISSIONS: \n13.  It was the submission of the Respondent that the in stallation of the coverings was a \nclaim to exclusive use of the trellis; that the cov ering would be attached to the external \nwall of the building and would alter the common pro perty; that it constituted \n\u201cexclusive use\u201d because such installation benefits the Applicants to the exclusion of \nother occupiers.  \n14.  The Respondent\u2019s submission in connection with issu e ii) was that s.63(c) of the Act \nwas mutually exclusive of s.33 of the Act and has n o bearing on exclusive use. It was \nalso the submission of the Respondent that a by-law  under s.33 of the Act had to be \npassed before the Respondents could install coverin g over the roof trellises   \n \n Ong Bee Lian & 21 others        STB No 86 of 2016 [ Sunglade] \nv MCST Plan No. 2874    \nPage 8 of 16 \n DECISION: \n15.  It is not in dispute that the coverings are to be i nstalled over the trellises. In the Agreed \nFacts, it is set out that it will be 130cm above the existing trellis and at the far end it \nwill be actually touching the existing trellis. At the point where it touches the trellis, it \ndoes not appear to be the case that the covering wa s anchored to or was resting on the \ntrellis. The diagram showed that the \u201c touching \u201d was a silicon seal between the \ncovering and the trellis.  \n16.  Whilst a finding can be made that the trellises wil l not be used in the installation of the \ncoverings, there is no dispute that the coverings w ill be anchored to the wall of the \nbuilding. The Applicants submitted that the wall wa s within the Applicants\u2019 lot and \nwas not common property. The Respondent submitted t hat the wall was maintained by \nthe management corporation and was common property.  \n17.  The submission of the Applicants that the exterior wall was not common property \nbecause it was within their lots, was based on the definition of \u201ccommon property\u201d in \ns.2 of the Act where it is set out that it means such part of the land and building \u2013 (i) \nnot comprised in any lot or proposed lot in the str ata title plan i.e.  any land and \nbuilding within the boundary of the lot cannot be common pro perty because it was \ncomprised  in the lot. In MCST Plan No 367 v Lee Siew Yuen  [2014] SGHC 161 (Lee \nSiew Yuen ), the management corporation submitted that defect ive beams were within \nthe lot and thus are not part of the common propert y as defined under the Act. Tan \nSiong Thye J, in Lee Siew Yuen, determined that comprised in the definition did not \nmean situated i.e. it is not correct that any land and building situated within the \nboundary of a lot cannot be common property. The su bmission of the Respondent that \nthe exterior wall of the lot was common property be cause it was maintained by the \nmanagement corporation was based on the duty of the  management corporation under \ns.29(1)(b) of the Act to maintain and keep common p roperty in a state of good and \nserviceable repair. Ong Bee Lian & 21 others        STB No 86 of 2016 [ Sunglade] \nv MCST Plan No. 2874    \nPage 9 of 16 \n 18.  Perusing the definition of \u201ccommon property\u201d in the  Act, it will be noted that there is \nno mention of the wall in the definition. However, in the 2003 version of the Land \nTitles Strata Act prior to revision in the Building  Maintenance and Strata Management \nAct 2004, \u201ccommon property\u201d was inter alia defined as follows: \n(c)  unless otherwise described specifically as com prised in any lot in any strata plan \n and shown as capable of being comprised in such lo t, includes \u2013  \n (i)  foundations, columns, beams, supports, walls,  roofs, lobbies, corridors, stairs, \n stairways, fire escapes, entrances and exits of th e building and windows installed \n in the external walls of the building;  \n19.  When the definition of common property as framed in  the Act was adopted, this was \nfor the purpose of simplifying the definition and w as not meant to exclude from the \ndefinition of common property the specific structur es listed in the previous edition of \nthe Land Titles Strata Act. See Lee Siew Yuen;  and Sit Kwong Lam v Management \nCorporation Strata Title Plan No 2645 [2017] SGHC 5 7 (Sit Kwong Lam) . \n20.  Tan Siong Thye J in Lee Siew Yuen at [33]  pronounced:  \nThe purpose behind the definition of common propert y under s 2(1) of the BMSMA is \nto exclude from common property those objects that are solely constructed within the \nsubsidiary proprietor\u2019s unit for the enjoyment of t he subsidiary proprietor only \nThe exterior walls of the building are not solely c onstructed within the subsidiary \nproprietor\u2019s unit for the enjoyment of the subsidia ry proprietor only. They are part of \nthe external fa\u00e7ade of the building and are maintai ned by the management corporation. \n21.  Common property would accordingly be used in the in stallation of the coverings in \nthis case. In Mark Wheeler v The MCST Plan No 751 and Anor [2003]  SGSTB  5 \n(Mark Wheeler), a retractable awning/canopy was installed on the ex ternal wall. The \nBoard in that case found that attaching any fixture  to the external wall for the better \nenjoyment of one\u2019s own lot would be use of common p roperty and that whilst the \nattachment does not bar others from accessing the w all, the attachment was a claim to \nexclusive use of that part of the wall. In Sit Kwong Lam, the Board found that the Ong Bee Lian & 21 others        STB No 86 of 2016 [ Sunglade] \nv MCST Plan No. 2874    \nPage 10 of 16 \n installation of an air conditioning vent on the ext ernal wall of the subsidiary \nproprietor\u2019s unit did constitute exclusive use and enjoyment or conferment of special \nprivileges because it would prevent the portion of the common property wall where it \nwas installed from being used and enjoyed by other occupiers and subsidiary \nproprietors. \n22.  It is the finding of the Board that there will, in this case, be exclusive use of common \nproperty when the coverings are installed over the trellises. \n23.  The submission of the Applicants with regard to iss ue ii) is that there are two classes \nof \u201cexclusive use\u201d of common property. The first is  the sort of exclusive use that \nrequires a by-law to be made pursuant to s.33  of the Act and the second viz exclusive \nuse in accordance with s.63(c) which would not requ ire the making of a by-law under \ns.33. The submission was that there was no power to  make a by-law with regard to the \nsecond viz  exclusive use that did not interfere unreasonably with the use and \nenjoyment of common property by others.  \nBUILDING MAINTENANCE & STRATA MANAGEMENT ACT \nExclusive use by-laws  \n33. \u2014 (1) Without prejudice to section 32, with the wri tten consent of the subsidiary \nproprietor of the lot concerned, a management corpo ration may make a by-law \u2014 \n(a) pursuant to an ordinary resolution, conferring on the subsidiary proprietor of a \n  lot specified in the by-law, or on the subsidiary  proprietors of the several lots so \n  specified, for a period not exceeding one year \u2014 \n  (i)  the exclusive use and enjoyment of; or \n (ii) special privileges in respect of, \n the whole or any part of the common property, upon  conditions (including the \n payment of money at specified times or as required  by the management \n corporation, by the subsidiary proprietor or subsi diary proprietors of the lot  or \n several lots) specified in the by- law; Ong Bee Lian & 21 others        STB No 86 of 2016 [ Sunglade] \nv MCST Plan No. 2874    \nPage 11 of 16 \n  (b) pursuant to a special resolution, conferring o n the subsidiary proprietor of a lot \n  specified in the by-law, or on the subsidiary pro prietors of the several lots so  \n  specified, for a period which exceeds one year bu t does not exceed 3 years and \n  cannot be extended by exercise of any option of r enewal to exceed an aggregate \n  of 3 years \u2014 \n(i)  the exclusive use and enjoyment of; or \n(ii) special privileges in respect of, \n   the whole or any part of the common property, up on conditions (including the \n   payment of money at specified times or as requir ed by the management  \n   corporation, by the subsidiary proprietor or sub sidiary proprietors of the lot or \n   several lots) specified in the by- law; \n(c)  pursuant to a 90% resolution, conferring on th e subsidiary proprietor of a lot \n specified in the by-law, or on the subsidiary prop rietors of the several lots so \n specified, for a period which exceeds 3 years \u2014 \n (i) the exclusive use and enjoyment of; or \n (ii) special privileges in respect of, \n the whole or any part of the common property, upon  conditions (including the \n payment of money at specified times or as required  by the management \n corporation, by the subsidiary proprietor or subsi diary proprietors of the lot or \n several lots) specified in the by-law; or \n(d)   amending, adding to or repealing a by-law mad e in accordance with \n paragraph (a), (b) or (c), as the case may be . \nDuties of subsidiary proprietors and other occupier s of lots  \n63.    A subsidiary proprietor, mortgagee in possession  (whether by himself or any other \nperson), lessee or occupier of a lot shall not \u2014  \n(c)  use or enjoy the common property in such a man ner or for such a purpose as to \n interfere unreasonably with the use or enjoyment o f the common property by the Ong Bee Lian & 21 others        STB No 86 of 2016 [ Sunglade] \nv MCST Plan No. 2874    \nPage 12 of 16 \n  occupier of any other lot (whether that person is a subsidiary proprietor or not) \n or by any other person entitled to the use and enj oyment of the common property;  \n24.  In Arthur Laurence Platt , the Court of Appeal in Queensland considered a di spute \n under the Building Units and Group Titles Act 1980  where there were provisions \n similar to s.33 and s.63(c) of the Act. Minority o wners in a development made use of \n the common property by placing display stands, sig ns, tables and chair outside their \n shops; an advertisement sign at the roof level; an d a parking sign that sought to \n appropriate/secure exclusive use of the parking lo t. Applications were made for \n orders/directions to stop the respondents\u2019 usage o f the common property. The \n dispute went before a referee who found that: i) p lacing of display stands or tables \n outside the shops was an expected and reasonable u se of common property; ii) the \n advertising sign did not dominate the roof level s o as to obscure the signs of the \n appellants and others;  and iii) the parking sign did not seek to appropriate/secure \n exclusive use of the parking lot. The matter then went before the Building Unit Appeal \n Tribunal. The magistrate who constituted the tribu nal found that i) placing of the \n display stands and tables outside the shops did am ount to exclusive use of common \n property ii) the advertising sign on the roof was an exclusive and unauthorised use of \n the exterior of the building; and iii) the parking  sign was an attempt to exercise \n exclusive use that was unauthorised. The decision of the tribunal was reversed by the \n High Court inter alia because the magistrate had made his decision withou t having \n first made a factual determination as to whether o r not the use made by the \n respondents had unreasonably interfered with the r ight of another to use it. The \n decision was reversed and the matter  remitted bac k to the tribunal (the magistrate) to \n make a determination on this  i.e to determine if there was unreasonable interference  \n with the rights of others to use the common proper ty.  \n25.  In the High Court, the judge (Derrington J) re marked: It seems to me that he (the \n magistrate) found that each obstruction on the com mon property amounted to \n exclusive possession, that it was therefore unlawf ul and that there was no need to \n consider it further.  Derrington J\u2019s view was that exclusive possession of common \n property not authorised by a by-law was not necess arily unlawful. It is when and if the Ong Bee Lian & 21 others        STB No 86 of 2016 [ Sunglade] \nv MCST Plan No. 2874    \nPage 13 of 16 \n  usage is challenged that the question will be pose d as to whether it interferes \n unreasonably with the use or enjoyment of common p roperty by the occupier of \n another lot or other person entitled to the use an d enjoyment of common property \n26. In the Court of Appeal, the majority viz Macphe rson J. A. and Ambrose J agreed with \n Derrington J.  \n27. The decision of the majority was that although (s.63(c) of the Act) did not in so many \n words expressly confer a right to use common prope rty in a manner or for a purpose \n that does not unreasonably interfere with the exer cise of similar rights by others, it is \n implicit if not explicit in those provisions that they have that effect. They assume the \n existence of a right to use and enjoy the common p roperty provided that it does not \n interfere unreasonably with the right of others to  do likewise.  It was noted that \n whenever any proprietor of a lot makes use of comm on property for a reasonable \n purpose from time to time he will often be making exclusive use of it while doing so.  \n28. It was the view of Pincus J.A. that, subject to  the power of the body corporate to \n confer a right of exclusive use, the law did not p ermit one tenant in common to do \n anything which could properly be described as an a bsolute exclusion of other tenants \n in common from the whole or any part of the common  property.  \n29. It should be noted that it was not the decision  of the majority in Arthur Laurence Platt  \n that the power of (the management corporation unde r s.33 of the Act) to make a by-\n law with regard to exclusive use and special privi leges over common property was \n limited to granting exclusive use over common prop erty that interfered unreasonably \n with the use and enjoyment of the common property by the occupier of another lot or \n other person entitled to the use and enjoyment of common property. \n30. At any point of time when common property is be ing used, e.g. walking along a path \nor setting up paraphernalia for games on a playgrou nd, there would be an exercise of \nexclusive use of the part of the common property th at is being occupied or used. As \nlong as the rights of other occupiers and others wh o are entitled to use that part of the \ncommon property are not being interfered with unrea sonably, a subsidiary proprietor Ong Bee Lian & 21 others        STB No 86 of 2016 [ Sunglade] \nv MCST Plan No. 2874    \nPage 14 of 16 \n who is using common property in the manner describe d, can continue using the \ncommon property. Even when the use will not unreaso nably interfere with the rights of \nothers, there is no right to an indefinite and unli mited use. At any point of time when \nthe use unreasonably interferes with another\u2019s righ t to use e.g. cleaners, employed by \nthe management corporation need to clean the path o r the playground, the subsidiary \nproprietor cannot continue with his exclusive use o f the common property. In Arthur \nLaurence Platt , the matter was referred back to the tribunal to m ake a factual \ndetermine as to whether the rights of others to use  the common property would be or \nwas interfered  with. It will not be out of order t o conclude that the tribunal\u2019s original \ndecision would stand in the event that a finding wa s made that the rights of others \nwould be interfered with. \n31. Under s.33 of the Act, a management corporation  is given a power to make a by-law \nconferring on a subsidiary proprietor the exclusive  use and enjoyment of, or special \nprivileges in respect of the whole or any part of t he common property. It is a provision \nthat enables a management corporation to confer exc lusive use and enjoyment of, or \nspecial privileges over any part of the common prop erty. When exclusive use has been \nconferred under this section the subsidiary proprie tor who has been conferred the \nexclusive use can use it for his own lawful purpose s and no one can use or access it \nwithout his permission. It would be as if he was th e sole proprietor of that part of the \ncommon property. The whole or part of common proper ty over which exclusive use \nhas been conferred under the section will, in effec t, cease to be common property that \ncan be used and enjoyed by other subsidiary proprie tors. It will be in order to repeat \nthat s.33 is an enabling provision and not a direct ory or a mandatory provision. The \nmanagement corporation is not directed or mandated to confer the rights prescribed in \nthe section in any set of circumstances. Where the management corporation has \nexercised the power under the section and conferred  exclusive use and enjoyment of, \nor special privileges over any part of the common p roperty on a subsidiary proprietor, \nno other subsidiary proprietor or other occupier ca n, as mentioned earlier, without his \nassent, make use of that part of the common propert y  for any purpose. Ong Bee Lian & 21 others        STB No 86 of 2016 [ Sunglade] \nv MCST Plan No. 2874    \nPage 15 of 16 \n 32. Unlike s.33, s.63(c) of the Act is not a provis ion where power is given to any person or \nany party to confer rights or privileges on another  party. It is a provision that spells out \nwhat a subsidiary proprietor cannot do with regard to common property and accepting \nthe decision of the majority in Arthur Laurence Platt  assumes  the existence of a right \nto use and enjoy the common property provided that it does not interfere unreasonably \nwith the right of others to do likewise . It does not in any way qualify or limit the dutie s \nand powers of the management corporation or the rig hts of other subsidiary proprietors \nor other occupiers over common property. The sectio n cannot be read to prevent a \nmanagement corporation from exercising powers under  s.33 of the Act. As long as a \nmanagement corporation has not exercised powers und er s.33 to confer on a subsidiary \nproprietor exclusive use and enjoyment of or specia l privileges over a part of the \ncommon property, that part will be available to all  subsidiary proprietors and occupiers \nto use and enjoy in accordance with s.63(c) of the Act. There is no conflict between \nthe two provisions. It could be in order to submit that that it is not necessary for a \nsubsidiary proprietor to procure a by-law for the e xclusive use and enjoyment of \ncommon property when his use will not unreasonably interfere with the use and \nenjoyment by others, but there can be no merit in a  submission that a management \ncorporation cannot exercise its powers under s.33 o f the Act over a part of the \ncommon property which can be used by a subsidiary p roprietor without unreasonably \ninterfere with another\u2019s use and enjoyment of that part of the common property. There \nis nothing in the section to suggest that the power  is limited in any way. Common \nproperty is defined in s.2 of the Act and under s.3 3 of the Act, a management \ncorporation can make a by-law conferring exclusive use and enjoyment over the whole \nor any part of the common property.  \n33.  The Applicants, in this matter, are applying f or an order from the Board for the \n Respondent to permit them to install coverings ove r the trellises. There is no dispute \n that the coverings are intended to be permanently installed and whilst their coverings \n are in place, they would be using common property  exclusively. Accordingly, an order \n granted by the Board would equate to the Board ord ering the Respondent to permit \n the Applicants to have right to exclusive use of t he common property for an unlimited \n period of time. There is no provision in the Act t hat  allows for a management to Ong Bee Lian & 21 others  STB No 86 of 2016 [Sunglade] \nv MCST Plan No. 2874 \nPage 16 of 16 confer on a subsidiary proprietor exclusive use and enjoyment of common property \nother than by making a by-law in accordance with s.33 of the Act.

This is a matter concerning the breakdown of the mechanised car parking system in the \nresidential strata development known as Heritage East (\u201c Heritage East\u201d).\n2. The Applicant, Ker Lee Ping, is the subsidiary proprietor of unit # XXX and the \nRespondent, MCST Plan No. 3822 (\u201cMCST\u201d), is the management corporation of \nHeritage East.\n3. The car parking facilities at Heritage East consists of 39 parking lots: 34 of them are \nsituated in the Fully Automated Mechanised Car Park (\u201cFAMCP\u201d) and the rest are \nsurface parking lots.Ker Lee Ping  v MCST Plan No. 3822        STB No 58  of 2016  Heritage East  \n3 4. The FAMCP is manufactured by a China company known as Hangzhou Xizi-IUK Parking \nSystems Co. Ltd (\u201cXizi\u201d). Chris -Ray Engineering Pte. Ltd. (\u201cChris-Ray\u201d) is the sole \nauthorised agent in Singapore for Xizi for the supply, installation and maintenance of the \nFAMCP.\n5. On 17 August 2012, the fire sprinkler was activated and it resulted in the basement of the \nFAMCP being flooded with water from the activated fire sprinkler. The FAMCP was shut \ndown but it was re-instated by Chris-Ray. Chris-Ray had determined that a major  \nservicing and repair was required for the system but this was not carried out by the reason \nof costs.\n6. On 3 September 2015, the fire sprinkler was again activated. It was caused by the smoke \nand sparks from an unauthorised welding carried out by the contractors engaged by the \nsubsidiary proprietor of unit #XXX. As a result of the water from the fire sprinkler, the \nFAMCP was shut down. It is undisputed that the FAMCP was shut down on 3 September  \n2015 and has since remained in that state.\n7. The shutdown of the FAMCP meant that no cars could be parked in the FAMCP. There \nwere insufficient surface parking lots for all the cars and some car owners parked their  \ncars along the roadside illegally. The illegal parking problem was highlighted to the grass-\nroot leaders, Member of Parliament of the constituency, officers from Land Transport \nAuthority (\u201cLTA\u201d) and Building and Construction Authority (\u201cBCA\u201d), and the police. To \ncreate more spaces for parking, the Respondent re-designated parts of the estate into \ntemporary parking lots including the area along the fire hydrant, breeching inlets and \nhandicapped lots. The Respondent required the owners of the cars parked at these lots to \nplace their contact numbers on the windscreen and be contactable at all times in case of \nan emergency so that their cars can be removed or relocated.\n8. After the shutdown of the FAMCP, the Respondent took various steps to restore it \nincluding directly contacting Xizi\u2019s engineers as well as engaging third parties to assess \nthe problem and restore it. However, it emerged that the Respondent had difficulty getting  \nXizi\u2019s help and as the FAMCP system is password protected, the third party contractors  \nengaged by the Respondent could not get the system restored. Chris-Ray is the holder of  \nthe password and he is not prepared to release the password to the Respondent.\n9. The Respondent entered into negotiations with Chris-Ray for the restoration works. In the \nfinal negotiation, the Respondent paid Chris-Ray a sum of $59,290.35 for the restoration  \nworks but did not agree to a three- year Equipment Maintenance Agreement (\u201cEMA \u201d). \nChris-Ray, on the other hand, insisted that the EMA is coupled with the restoration works \nand refused to commence the restoration works until the agreement bearing the EMA term \nis signed by parties. The negotiation came to a standstill.\n10. As at the hearing of this application, the FAMCP has been shut down for a period of about \none (1) year and five (5) months.Ker Lee Ping  v MCST Plan No. 3822        STB No 58  of 2016  Heritage East  \n4 11. By reason of the foregoing matters, the Applicant filed an application b efore the Board\nseeking the following orders against the Respondent:\ni. Pursuant to section 101(1)(a) of the Building Maintenance and Strata Management\nAct (\u201c BMSMA \u201d), an order that the Respondent performs its duties under section\n29(1)(b)(i) of the BMSMA by rectifying and bringing to operating condition the\nFAMCP within 2 months of the orders being made or within such time as this\nHonourable Tribunal shall deem fit. In the Applicant\u2019s closing submission, she\namended the prayer to: -\n\u201cPursuant to section 101(1)(a) or, in the alternative, section 101(1)(c) of the \nBMSMA, an order that the Respondent engages [Chris -Ray] within 7 days of \nthis order to rectify the FAMCP and bring it to operating condition or within \nsuch time as this Honourable Tribunal deems fi t; or an order that the Respondent \nrectifies and brings to operating condition the FAMCP within 2 months of the \norders being made or within such time as this Honourable Tribunal shall deem \nfit\u201d; \nii. Pursuant to section 101(3) of the BMSMA, an order that the Re spondent pays to the\nApplicant damages for loss of convenience arising from the loss of use of the\nFAMCP, estimated to be $20.42 per day, or any other such rate that this Honourable\nTribunal shall deem fit, from the date of the failure of the FAMCP until t he\nfunctioning of the same has been fully and completely restored, or for any such\nperiod that this Honourable Tribunal deems fit;\niii. Pursuant to section 110 of the BMSMA, an order that the Respondent pursues an\ninsurance claim for the damage to the FAMCP oc casioned by the sprinkler\nactivation on 3 September 2015; and\niv. costs.\n12. In her closing submission, the Applicant withdrew prayer (iii) as during cross -\nexamination the Respondent had stated that they intended to pursue an insurance claim\nin due course.\nTHE  APPLICANT\u2019S CASE  \n13. The Applicant submits that her application should be granted because section 29(1)(b)(i)\nof the BMSMA imposes a mandatory duty on the Respondent to properly maintain and\nkeep in a state of good and serviceable repair (including, where nec essary, renew or\nreplace the whole or part thereof) the FAMCP. It is undisputed that the FAMCP is a\ncommon property. The Applicant argues that as the FAMCP continues to remain in a\nstate of disrepair and not functional, the Respondent has failed to perform  its statutory\nduty.\n14. The Applicant claims that the FAMCP has remained in a state of disrepair for more than\n1 year and 6 months (as at the date of submission by parties) and the Respondent\u2019sKer Lee Ping  v MCST Plan No. 3822        STB No 58  of 2016  Heritage East  \n5 failure to repair the FAMCP has caused her and the other subsidi ary proprietors to suffer \nsevere inconvenience. The Applicant also submits that the temporary parking \narrangements posed safety hazards as the temporary parking lots allowed cars to be \nparked at places which blocked access to crucial firefighting  points.  \n15. The Applicant also seeks an order compelling the Respondent to engage Chris -Ray to\nperform the rectification works on the basis that Chris -Ray is the sole authorised agent\nof Xizi who has the expertise to repair the FAMCP quickly. Chris -Ray is also ready a nd\nwilling to proceed with the repair of the FAMCP.\n16. The Applicant submits that appointing Chris -Ray for the rectification will not result in\nthe Respondent being taken advantage of as Chris -Ray has always quoted a fair price\nand any increases in price over time was slight and, in any event, justified. The Applicant\nis of the view that the terms of the contract were thoroughly negotiated between Chris -\nRay and the Respondent. The Respondent had in fact acquiesced to all the terms in the\nrectification cont ract save for the requirement to enter into the EMA. The Applicant\nopines that the EMA accompanying the contract for rectification works is competitively\npriced and does not prejudice the Respondent. Further, since the Respondent had already\npaid a sum of $56,635.48 to Chris -Ray for the rectification work, it is convenient and\npractical to accept Chris -Ray\u2019s condition to couple the rectification work with the EMA\nrather than to attempt to extract the said monies (if necessary) and proceed with a\nseparate co ntractor.\n17. The Applicant submits that if this Tribunal does not agree with the Applicant\u2019s prayer\nto order the Respondent to engage Chris -Ray, she prays that the Board would\nnevertheless order the Respondent to rectify and bring to operating condition the\nFAMCP within 2 months of the orders being made or within such time as this Tribunal\nshall deem fit.\n18. On the prayer for payment of damages, the Applicant submits that by section 101(3) of\nthe BMSMA, the Board is empowered to make an order for the payment o f damages not\nexceeding the jurisdictional limit of the District Court. If the present proceedings were\nto commence in a Civil Court, the Respondent would have been awarded damages for\nthe loss suffered by the Applicant occasioned by the Respondent\u2019s negli gence. In\nquantifying the damages, the Applicant arrived at the sum of $20.42 per day using the\nseason parking fees at Parkway Parade and private transport between Parkway Parade\nand Heritage East as the gauge. The Applicant submits that this amounts to\napproximately $612.60 per month and is not an onerous burden for the Respondent to\nbear.\n19. For the aforesaid reasons, the Applicant prays that an order be made in favour her\nprayers (i) and (ii).Ker Lee Ping  v MCST Plan No. 3822        STB No 58  of 2016  Heritage East  \n6 THE RESPONDENT\u2019S CASE  \n20. Ng Bee Choo @ Ng Catherine, the Director  of Credas Management, which is the current\nManaging Agent for Heritage East gave evidence for the Respondent.\n21. The Respondent claims that it has not been negligent or lackadaisical in discharging its\nduties. Instead, the Respondent argues that they had e xercised considerable\nresourcefulness and diligence in \ufb01nding a solution to the problem posed by the FAMCP,\nincluding actively engaging the expertise of third parties and minimizing the impact on\nthe residents by introducing temporary parking solutions. Th e Respondent submits that\ntheir efforts to restate the FAMCP were stymied by unexpected obstacles beyond their\ncontrol. They cannot be blamed for the delay in restoring the FAMCP because Chris -Ray\nhad prevented Xizi\u2019s engineers from coming over to try to f ix the system and had refused\nto disclose the password to the system. Without the password, it is almost impossible for\nthe Respondent to make any progress.\n22. The Respondent professes that they were at all times acting in the best interests of all the\nsubsidiary proprietors by carefully negotiating with Chris -Ray. The Respondent considers\nit prudent to do so because they found that Chris -Ray had increased its quotation for the\nsame kind of work without explanation and its pricing is far higher than the quot ation\nsubmitted by another contractor. The Respondent was also informed by third party\ncontractors that the parts recommended by Chris -Ray for replacement are unnecessary.\n23. The Respondent says that it had already paid Chris -Ray the money for the restorati on\nworks. However, it is Chris -Ray who refuses to carry out any restoration works until the\nRespondent agrees to the EMA. The Respondent argues that the EMA which is for an\nincreased price is not a favourable term. The Respondent also argues that it has th e\nsanction, approval and majority approbation of the subsidiary proprietors obtained at the\nannual general meeting held on 12 November 2016 to terminate all contracts and dealings\nwith Chris -Ray and not to enter into any contracts that may be a liability t o the subsidiary\nproprietors. In the premises, the Respondent says that it is acting under the mandate from\nthe subsidiary proprietors and objects to re -appointing Chris -Ray. The Respondent\nsubmits that it is inappropriate for the Board to make an order co mpelling them to re -\nappoint Chris -Ray.\n24. As for the Applicant\u2019s claim for damages, the Respondent submits that the amount prayed\nfor is merely an estimation which does not amount to proper quantification of loss. The\nApplicant had failed to particularise and show the extent of her loss and damage.\nConsequently, the Respondent prays that the Board makes no order for loss and damages\nto the Applicant.\n25. The Respondent submits that to date, the Respondent is still actively involved in finding\na solution to rep air the FAMCP. Notably, it had made payment to Chris -Ray for the repair\nworks to be carried out immediately. The Respondent argues that it had discharged its\nduties with reasonable skill and has acted honestly at all times. In the circumstance, it isKer Lee Ping  v MCST Plan No. 3822        STB No 58  of 2016  Heritage East  \n7 not reasonable for the Applicant to pursue the claim of negligence against the Respondent. \nThe Respondent therefore submits that this application should be dismissed with costs.  \nTHE BOARD\u2019S DECISION  \nPrayer (i) - Restoring the FAMCP  \n26. The key issue before the Board is whether the Respondent had failed to perform its duty\nunder section 29(1)(b)(i) of the BMSMA to keep the common property, the FAMCP, in\nan operational condition.\n27. Section 29(1)(b)(i) BMSMA provides as follows:\n\u201cExcept a s otherwise provided in subsection (3), it shall be the duty of a management \ncorporation \u2013  \n(b) to properly maintain and keep in a state of good and serviceable repair (including,\nwhere reasonably necessary, renew or replace the whole or part thereof) \u2014\n(i) the common property;\u201d\n28. It is clear from the language adopted in section 29(1)(b)(i) of the BMSMA that the duty\nplaced upon the management corporation to maintain and keep the common property in a\nstate of good and serviceable repair is mandatory and not discre tionary. The duty is not\npremised on conditions; neither can the management corporation diminish or delay the\ndischarge of its duty.\n29. Under the section, the word \u201crepair\u201d is also sufficiently broad to allow the management\ncorporation to do certain things: it permits the management corporation, where necessary,\nto renew or to replace the whole or parts of the common property. As such, the\nmanagement corporation has the discretion as well as the flexibility of using different\napproaches when performing its st atutory duty. The effect of section 29(1)(b)(i) of the\nBMSMA is that the management corporation is imposed with the power, duty and\nfunction to manage and maintain all common properties for the benefit, use and enjoyment\nby all the subsidiary proprietors, and such a duty has to be carried out in a timely manner\nby the management corporation using its judgment and resources.\n30. The Board finds that, on the facts of the case, the Respondent has failed to discharge its\nstatutory duty. The Board finds that the Re spondent has not done enough given that it is\nobliged to maintain and keep the FAMCP in a state of good and serviceable repair and it\nis conferred with the power needed to achieve it. The Board also considers that the length\nof time for which the FAMCP has  remained shut down  is fatal to the Respondent\u2019s case.\n31. The relationship between the Respondent and Chris -Ray is notably marked by acrimony.\nThe parties blame each other for the delay in restoring the FAMCP. The Respondent pegs\nthe cause to the unreasonabl e acts and unfavourable demands of Chris -Ray, alleging that\nits efforts to directly engage the help of Xizi and a third party contractor to repair theKer Lee Ping  v MCST Plan No. 3822        STB No 58  of 2016  Heritage East  \n8 FAMCP were hindered by Chris -Ray\u2019s intervention and also its refusal to disclose the \npassword to the syst em. The Respondent further alleges that it had already made payment \nto Chris -Ray but Chris -Ray is capitalizing on the situation by coupling the restoration \nworks with a three -year EMA. Chris -Ray, on the other hand, maintains that it had acted \nreasonably de spite the Respondent\u2019s breach of contract for non -payment of its bills and \nalso when the Respondent engaged an unauthorised third party to perform works on the \nFAMCP. Chris -Ray also denies that it had intervened and prevented the manufacturer \nfrom coming t o Singapore to assist the Respondent. Chris -Ray proclaims that it is always \nready and willing to proceed with the repair of the FAMCP and it is the Respondent who \nrefuses to agree to the term of the restoration works.  \n32. The Board is not in the position nor  should it adjudge the merits of the disputes and be\nembroiled in the disputes between the Respondent and Chris -Ray which primarily\nconcerns contractual terms and conditions. The disputes and intransigence between the\nRespondent and Chris -Ray cannot justif y the Respondent\u2019s inordinate delay in restoring\nthe FAMCP to working condition. Crucially, the Respondent cannot diminish or postpone\nits statutory responsibility for the administration and maintenance of the common\nproperty. It is not an option for the R espondent to leave a common property in a non -\nfunctional state, let alone for such an extended period of time.\n33. While the Board recognises that the Respondent is concerned with the terms and\nconditions of the contract with Chris -Ray, uncertainty in many si tuations are unavoidable.\nIf the cause and effect of decisions to be made were to be stretched too far, this will\neventually transform itself into pure conjecture: it might happen, but it might not.\n34. The Board also cannot overlook the indisputable fact th at the Applicant and the other\nresidents of Heritage East have been deprived of the use of the FAMCP for 1 year and 6\nmonths. The Board notes that the detriment is to all of the subsidiary proprietors and the\nimpact is exceptional because the only mechanis ed car parking system in the development\nis not in operation and it renders the majority of the parking lots in the development\ncompletely inaccessible.\n35. The Board is of the opinion that such matters cannot be left in a limbo until the\nRespondent finds at its own time and pace a solution. The Respondent having taken 1\nyear and 6 months (and counting), in attempting to resolve the matter reflects a lack of\nsense of urgency on their part in tackling the problem. The Respondent, at the hearing,\ndisclosed that they are looking to commence a litigation suit against Chris -Ray. Surely\nthe residents cannot be made to wait until the disputes between them are resolved before\nthe FAMCP is restored.\n36. The interim solutions put in place by the Respondent which included directing residents\nand visitors to park their cars outside of the estate and designating parking lots along the\nfire hydrant raised safety issues and were clearly in breach of the Road Tr affic Rules. In\nparticular, the rule against parking a vehicle within 3 metres on either side of any fireKer Lee Ping  v MCST Plan No. 3822        STB No 58  of 2016  Heritage East  \n9 hydrant is absolute and must not be violated at all times. The penalty for a breach of this \nrule is a fine. By passing a circular that directed reside nts to park their cars next to the fire \nhydrant, the Respondent was effectively encouraging the commission of a road traffic \noffence and endangering public safety. This is preposterous and wholly unacceptable. \nThis situation had gone on from the time the F AMCP was shut down and it was only \ncorrected after this Board reminded the Respondent that its direction was illegal and \ndangerous.  \n37. The Board also finds that the Respondent has not exhausted its options. The Board is of\nthe view that there are clearly ot her options available to the Respondent. Instead of\nactively exploring plausible alternatives, the Respondent became embroiled in disputes\nwith Chris -Ray on contractual terms and conditions.\n38. It does not appear to the Board that the Respondent has any cle ar and proper plans. The\nexisting situation is unsatisfactory and is in contradiction to the Respondent\u2019s mandatory\nstatutory duty to maintain the common property in a state of good and serviceable repair.\nThe statutory duty placed upon the Respondent requ ires immediate action to put the\nFAMCP into working condition without further delay.\n39. In her closing submission, the Applicant also prayed for the Board to order the\nRespondent to engage Chris -Ray to rectify the FAMCP. The Board dismisses this part of\nthe prayer as it is clearly not within the purview of the Board\u2019s power to micromanage\nthe Respondent and interfere with their decision on which contractor to engage.\n40. For the aforesaid reasons, the Board orders that the Respondent rectify and bring the\nFAMC P to an operating condition within 3 months of this order.\nPrayer (ii) \u2013 Damages  \n41. The evidence produced by the Applicant failed to prove that she had in fact incurred\nexpenses arising from the inconvenience caused by the breakdown of the FAMCP. The\nBoard is not satisfied that the Applicant should be awarded damages and in that respect,\nthe Board dismisses this prayer.\nPrayer (iii) - Insurance claim for the damage to the FAMCP  \n42. As the Applicant withdrew this prayer, the Board need not address this prayer.\nConclusion  \n43. In conclusion, having considered all the facts of the case, the Board makes the following\norders:Ker Lee Ping  v MCST Plan No. 3822        STB No 58  of 2016  Heritage East  \n10 i. that the Respondent rectify and bring to operating condition the FAMCP within 3\nmonths from the date of this order;\nii. that the Applicant\u2019s prayer ( ii) be dismissed; and\niii. that the Applicant be permitted to withdraw her prayer for the Respondent to pursue\nan insurance claim for the damage to the FAMCP occasioned by the sprinkler\nactivation on 3 September 2015.\nThe B oard will hear parties on costs. \n________________________  \nMR ALFONSO ANG  \nPresident  \n ________________________  \n MR GOH TIAM LOCK  \n Member  \n ________________________  \n MR TER KIM CHEU  \n Member  \nMr Joel Quah (M/s Tan Pen g Chin LLC) for the Applicant/s  \nMr Simon Tan (M/s Attorney s Inc LLC) for the Respondent/s  "

The Applicant, Zou Xiong, is the subsidiary proprietor of unit #XXX (\u201cthe Unit\u201d) at \nthe residential strata development known as 19 Shelford Road (\u201cthe Development\u201d) and the Zou Xiong  STB No. 79 of 2016 [19 Shelford Road] \nv Management Corporation Strata \nTitle Plan No. 2360 \n3 Respondent, MCST Plan No. 2360 (\u201c MCST \u201d), is the management corporation of the \nDevelopment.  \nBACKGROUND \n2. The Applicant has been residing at the Unit since 18 June 2016 with his wife, two young\nchildren aged 21/2 and 41/2 years old, his mother- in-law and a domestic helper. \n3. The Unit is situated on the highest floor of the 4-storey building. It has a large open\nbalcony accessible from the living area labelled as roof terrace and over the open balcony is a \ntrellis roof. The railings of the balcony are 92 cm from the ground and consists of three \nhorizontal bars. The railings have gaps of 20 cm between each horizontal bar. There are only \n8 units out of 256 units with such a design in the Development. \n4. Being the parents of 2 young children, the Applicant is concerned that his children will\nscale the railings and fall over. On 23 May 2016, the Applicant sent an email to the managing \nagent (\u201c MA\u201d) of the Development and requested to install the invisible grilles at his Unit\u2019s \nbalcony. The said application was rejected by the MA on 25 May 2016 and no reasons were \ngiven for the rejection. The MA merely instructed the Applicant to appeal to the management \ncouncil. On the same day and as instructed by the MA, the Applicant made an appeal to the \nmanagement council by email. Also, following the request of the MA on 27 May 2016, the \nApplicant had emailed to her drawings of the invisible grilles he intended to install. \n5. In the meantime, also on 25 May 2016, the Applicant submitted a formal application to\nthe management corporation for a series of renovation works but had failed to include the \napplication for the installation of invisible grilles. At no point during the email correspondence \nwas the Applicant informed to make a formal application for the invisible grilles. \n6. On 24 June 2016, the MA informed the Applicant that following the management\ncouncil\u2019s instructions, she was following up with \u201cthe relevant authorities for their clarification \nand advise before any approval to be issued\u201d. On 11 July 2016, the MA informed the Applicant \nthat the proposed improvement works affecting the appearance of the building\u2019s fa\u00e7a de would Zou Xiong  STB No. 79 of 2016 [19 Shelford Road] \nv Management Corporation Strata \nTitle Plan No. 2360 \n4 require the approval of the Respondent and not the management council. The MA suggested \nthat the Applicant could request a resolution to be tabled at a general meeting for the general \nbody to collectively determine a set of design guidelines for the installation of invisible grilles. \n7. As the Applicant had not heard from the MA on what the relevant authorities had to\nsay, he emailed the Urban Redevelopment Authority (\u201c URA \u201d) directly. The URA confirmed \nthat they had no objections to the installation of invisible grilles and that planning permission \nwas not required. On 21 July 2016, the MA informed the Applicant that \u201cAs for the safety of \nyour kids, you may want to look into a temporary measure before the approval being made in \na general meeting\u201d.   They did not inform him what constitutes a temporary measure. \n8. On 17 August 2016 and as a temporary measure to ensure the safety of his children, the\nApplicant instructed his contractors to install the invisible grilles on his balcony. The structure \nincluded metal frames on which the wire cables were mounted on and these metal frames are \nsecured onto the floor of the balcony as well as onto the walls.  When the Respondent noticed \nthe installation, the Respondent stopped the installation and the police was called in when the \nApplicant refused to stop. The Respondent stated that no approval was given for the installation \nand that a portion of the metal frame is mounted onto the external wall which is a common \nproperty. The installation remains incomplete as at the date of this application. \n9. By way of letters dated 20 and 25 August 2016, the Respondent informed the Applicant\nthat the installation of invisible grilles was not approved because statutory by-laws 5(1) to 5(5) \nof the Building Maintenance (Str ata Management) Regulations 2005 (\u201c BMSMR \u201d), which \nstates that subsidiary proprietors shall not be prevented from installing any structure or device \nto prevent harm to children, apply only to \u2018windows\u2019 and \u2018balconies\u2019. As the Applicant\u2019s \nbalcony was labelled a \u2018roof garden\u2019, the statutory by -laws did not apply. The Respondent \nreiterated that the proposed installation of invisible grilles could only be approved at a general \nmeeting of the management corporation. \n10. On 13 September 2016, the Respondent\u2019s solicitors wrote to the Applicant\u2019s solicitors\nstating that the Applicant\u2019s installation works affected the appearance of the building and that \nthe approval of the management corporation was required. Zou Xiong  STB No. 79 of 2016 [19 Shelford Road] \nv Management Corporation Strata \nTitle Plan No. 2360 \n5 11. The Applicant proceeded to file this application before the Board on 26 September 2016\nand sought the following orders against the Respondent: \n(a) That pursuant to section 111 of the Building Maintenance and Strata\nManagement Act (\u201c BMSMA \u201d) the Respondent consents to the Applicant\u2019s\napplication for approval to install \u2018invisible\u2019 safety grilles at the balcony of his\nUnit; and\n(b) that the Respondent pay costs of this application.\n12. In the course of the proceedings, the Respondent admitted that there were no design\nguidelines prescribed for the Development for the installation of invisible grilles at the open \nbalcony and that the Respondent works on a case- by-case evaluation for each request that it \nreceives. In this case, the Respondent had at various times proposed different alternatives for \nthe Applicant to adopt. Briefly, they are as follows:- \n(i) Firstly, by a letter through their solicitors on 13 September 2016, the\nRespondent stated that it was prepared to permit the installation of 1.2m high\nacrylic sheet at the balcony railing.\n(ii) At the mediation of this application, the Respondent suggested that the\nApplicant string the high tension aluminium wires to the existing beams at the\nbalcony of the unit. For the portion of the balcony that does not have a trellis\nbeam, the Respondent suggested stringing the wire cables horizontally between\nthe existing trellis column and the wall, or in the alternative, to install acrylic\nsheet/laminated glass on this portion of the balcony railing. The idea behind the\nRespondent\u2019s proposed alternatives i s that the installation of the invisible grilles\nmust not detract from the appearance of the building.\n(iii) Finally, during the 17th AGM on 26 November 2016, the Respondent passed a\nby-law permitting the installation of acrylic sheet/laminated glass up to a height\nof 5 feet at the railing for those units with roof terrace or balcony.Zou Xiong  STB No. 79 of 2016 [19 Shelford Road] \nv Management Corporation Strata \nTitle Plan No. 2360 \n6 13. The Applicant rejected the Respondent\u2019s proposed alternatives for various reasons\nwhich will be expounded below. \nAPPLICANT\u2019S CASE  \n14. The Applicant submits that the Board ought to make the orders being sought for the\nfollowing reasons: \n(i) It is for the safety of their two young children. The Applicant submitted that the\nprescribed by-laws expressly disallow management corporations from stopping\nsubsidiary proprietors f rom installing \u201cany structure or device to prevent harm\nto children\u201d. The Applicant also submitted that the decision in Sujit Singh Gill\nv MCST Plan No. 3466  [2015] SGSTB 2 (\u201cSujit Singh Gill \u201d) which similarly\ninvolves the installation of invisible grilles supports the Applicant\u2019s application\nin that management corporations are not to prevent subsidiary proprietors from\ninstalling safety structures such as grilles even if such installation is mounted\non common property and even if it alters the appearance and fa\u00e7ade of the\nbuilding. Lastly, the Applicant adduced a newspaper report dated 25 January\n2015 which cited  Ms Lee Bee Wah, head of the Government Parliamentary\nCommittee on National Development and Environment, as agreeing with the\ndecision in Sujit Singh Gill ; and\n(ii) The metal frames do not affect the facade of the building. The Applicant argues\nthat the metal frames are not obvious and difficult to spot. The Applicant also\nobserved that many other units had installations on their balconies which\nobviously detracted from the appearance of the building;\n15. The Respondent had professed that it had not unreasonably refused to authorise the\ninstallation work because the Applicant did not make any application to install the invisible \ngrilles. The Applicant counters that the Respondent\u2019s contention is disingenuous as the \nApplicant had written emails to the Respondent for permission. In any case, the by-law \nrequiring renovation applications to be made by way of a prescribed renovation application \nform was made two months after the filing of this application and therefore does not apply to Zou Xiong   STB No. 79 of 2016 [19 Shelford Road]  \nv Management Corporation Strata  \nTitle Plan No. 2360    \n7 \n the Applicant.   \n \n16. The Applicant further poi nted out that the Respondent had  been changing its position \nand at different times gave different reasons for not approving his application. The R espondent \ninitially rejected the Applicant\u2019s application without giving any reasons. On appeal, the \nRespondent explained that the MA was checking with the relevant authorities. On being \npressed, the Respondent said that the installation works affected the facade of the building and \nwould require the approval of the management corporation. Subsequently, the Respondent \ncited that the statutory by -laws did not apply but later reverted to its original position, stating \nthat the installation works were rejected because it affected the fa\u00e7ade of the building and as \nbefore, the approval of the management corporation is required.  \n \n17. With reference to the Respondent\u2019s latest position, the Applicant refutes that the \nRespondent is mistaken as there is no such provisi on in the BMSMA or the regulations \nthereunder and it is for the management council to make the decision. The Applicant asserts \nthat it is for the Respondent to pass design guidelines by -laws and the Respondent cannot use \nthe lack of design guidelines as an  excuse for rejecting the Applicant\u2019s application.  \n \n18. The Applicant rejects the alternatives proposed for the following reasons: - \n(a) Firstly, the installation of acrylic sheet at the height of 1.2m is insufficient to \nprevent a child from scaling the rai lings;  \n \n(b) Secondly, the installation of acrylic sheet/ laminating glass at the railings to a \nheight of 5 feet is considered an enclosure of the roof terrace and having \nenquired with URA on 23 December 2016, URA had in its email reply expressly \nstated tha t such installation is not permitted; and  \n \n(c) Thirdly, the mounting of the invisible grilles onto the existing trellis beam is \nstructurally unsafe. In this regard, the Applicant produced a professional \nengineer report which states that the existing trelli s beam, in its normal design \npractice, is not designed to carry the additional load contributed by the cables.  Zou Xiong   STB No. 79 of 2016 [19 Shelford Road]  \nv Management Corporation Strata  \nTitle Plan No. 2360    \n8 \n 19. The Applicant argues that it had considered all of the alternatives proposed by the \nRespondent and they are neither legal nor workable. In t he premises, the Applicant\u2019s proposal \nof installing invisible grilles by erecting metal frames where the wire cables are mounted is the \nbest method and the Applicant should be permitted to continue with the installation.  \n \nRESPONDENT\u2019S CASE  \n20. The Respondent submits that the Applicant did not make any application by way of the \nprescribed form for the installation of the invisible grilles. The renovation form submitted by \nthe Applicant on 25 May 2016 makes no mention of the installation of invisible grilles. The \nRespondent therefore takes the position that the Applicant merely enquired through emails \nabout the installation of invisible grilles and it was not a formal application made to the \nRespondent for consideration and approval.  \n \n21. The Responden t also takes the position that the design of the invisible grilles submitted \nby the Applicant affects the appearance of the Development. The Respondent therefore regards \nthat it was not in the position to grant an approval in this case and suggests that th e Applicant \nseek approval for the installation of the invisible grilles from the general body.  \n \n22. The Respondent submits that it cannot be faulted for the Applicant\u2019s failure to table a \nmotion at the annual general meeting (\u201c AGM \u201d) having informed the App licant to do so.  \n \n23. The Respondent further argues that the metal frame is unsightly and makes the \nDevelopment appear untidy which is in breach of the statutory by -law 10 which states that:  \n\u201cA subsidiary proprietor or an occupier of a lot shall not, except with the prior written \napproval of the management corporation, hang any washing, towel, bedding, clothing \nor other article on any part of the parcel in such a way as to be visible from outside the \nsubdivided building, other than at areas designated for the purpose and there only for \na reasonable period.\u201d  \n \n24. The Respondent submits that it had offered alternatives to the Applicant which the Zou Xiong   STB No. 79 of 2016 [19 Shelford Road]  \nv Management Corporation Strata  \nTitle Plan No. 2360    \n9 \n Applicant refused to adopt. The Respondent says that the installation of acrylic sheet is \nsufficient to prevent  children from scaling the railings and also preserves the fa\u00e7ade of the \nbuilding. The same has been adopted by other subsidiary proprietors in the Development. The \ninstallation of the invisible grilles on the existing trellis beams is also aesthetically c onsistent \nwith the appearance of the rest of the Development.  \n \n25. The Respondent explains that the Applicant insisted on installing invisible grilles \nmounted on metal frames. However, as the visible metal frames affect the fa\u00e7ade of the \nbuilding, the desi gn was not approved. The Respondent clarified that they do not object to the \ninstallation of the invisible grilles per se. The objection is against the visible frame. The \nRespondent observes that there are other subsidiary proprietors who had their applica tion for \nthe installation of invisible grilles approved because the installation does not detract from the \nappearance of the Development. Hence, there is no blanket disapproval for invisible grilles.  \n \n26. The Respondent submits that the alternatives propo sed by them are effective in \npreventing a child from falling over the balcony and keeps with the appearance of the building. \nIt is the Applicant who refuses to accept the Respondent\u2019s proposed alternatives and this \napplication is unnecessary. On that basis , the Respondent asks that this application be \ndismissed.  \n \nBOARD\u2019S DECISION  \n27. All parties agree that children\u2019s safety is the paramount consideration. This has been \nrepeatedly emphasised by the Board as well as by the Building and Construction Authority \n(\u201cBCA \u201d) in its circulars. Although the Respondent had initially rejected the Applicant\u2019s \napplication without giving any reasons, the Respondent eventually permitted the installation of \ninvisible grilles subject to conditions. If the Respondent had held its  initial position, the \nRespondent would have been unreasonable. In the present case, the Respondent gave various \nreasons for not approving the Applicant\u2019s application for the installation of invisible grilles but \nbased on the evidence and the facts, the Bo ard is of the view that the Respondent had not \nsatisfactorily justified its position.  \n Zou Xiong  STB No. 79 of 2016 [19 Shelford Road] \nv Management Corporation Strata \nTitle Plan No. 2360 \n10 A. No Formal Application made by the Applicant\n28. The Respondent contends that as the Applicant did not submit his application for the\ninstallation of invisible grilles in the prescribed form, the current application to the Strata Titles \nBoards is premature and hence, it cannot be said that the Respondent has unreasonably refused \nto authorise the installation of grilles in the Applicant\u2019s Unit as no actual rejecti on was given \nby the Respondent. \n29. On the facts, the Board notes that despite the absence of a prescribed form, the\nRespondent had corresponded with the Applicant with regards to the installation as if an \napplication was made to them. The Respondent was fully aware of the Applicant\u2019s intention to \ninstall invisible grilles at his balcony as evidenced by the email correspondences between May \n2016 to August 2016. On 25 May 2016, the Respondent even instructed the Applicant to make \nan appeal against the rejection at the first instance through email. Additionally, the Board also \nnotes that the prescribed form only came into effect after the Respondent lodged it with BCA \nand this was after this application was made.  \n30. On that basis, the Board takes the view that the Respondent knew from the onset that\nthe Applicant was making an application with the Respondent and had regarded the Applicant\u2019s \nemail as a formal application. The Board finds that at the time when the application was made \nthere was no prescribed form. Therefore, the application is validly made and the Respondent \nshould not take advantage of the procedure as the Respondent is aware of the specific nature \nof the application. \nB. Requirement of Consent from the General Body\n31. The Respondent submits that it cannot give approval for the Applicant\u2019s application to\ninstall invisible grilles because the proposed works affect the facade of the building and such \napproval is to be given by the general body and not by the Respondent. The Board takes the \nview that this reasoning is unsatisfactory because it is within the Respondent\u2019s power to give \nsuch an approval. It is the Respondent\u2019s role to put in place a set of design guidelines for the \ninstallation of safety grilles that address both the safety issues and the issues regarding the Zou Xiong  STB No. 79 of 2016 [19 Shelford Road] \nv Management Corporation Strata \nTitle Plan No. 2360 \n11 facade of the Development, so that the subsidiary proprietors can comply with such guidelines. \nWhere there is no design guidelines, the subsidiary proprietor\u2019s application for the installation \nof invisible grilles have to be decided on a case- by-case basis. In exercising its power, the \nRespondent should not defer its responsibility to the general body.   \n32. The Board also observes that the Respondent had, for other subsidiary proprietors,\nconsidered and approved their application for installation works that affect the facade of the \nbuilding. As such, the Board cannot accept that the Respondent in this case is not able to do \nthe same. Even if the Respondent\u2019s position was correct, the Respondent should have adopted \na more active role to facilitate the Applicant in his application, especially in a case such as this \nwhere children\u2019s safety is concerned. The Respondent ought to take the initiative to provide \nthe guidelines for its subsidiary proprietors and it is not for the Applicant to initiate an approval \nfor such guidelines. \nC. Reasonableness of the Respondent\u2019s Proposed Alternatives\n33. The Board notes that the Respondent had made three alternative proposals in place of\nthe Applicant\u2019s invisible grilles design. Having considered  the facts and evidence before it, the \nBoard accepts that the Applicant had in fact considered the alternatives provided by the \nRespondent but finds that all three of the alternative proposals were unreasonable and not \nviable. The Board also observes that the Respondent\u2019s offers were made spontaneously at \ndifferent times, some during the midst of this application, without proper consideration. \n34. The first alternative provided by the Respondent was to permit the installation of a 1.2m\nhigh acrylic sheet a t the balcony railings. The Board notes that children\u2019s safety is of paramount \nconsideration and it is imperative that in situations such as this one, parents should control their \nchildren to prevent them from scaling the balcony bars. Nevertheless, the Board notes that \nbased on the design of the railings in the Applicant\u2019s Unit, the proposed acrylic sheet at the \nheight of 1.2m, is only slightly above the height of the railings as it currently stands. Having \nconsidered the current facts, the Board is of the view that while the proposal may temporarily \ndeter the Applicant\u2019s children from employing the railings as a ladder, this proposal fails to \naddress the Applicant\u2019s fundamental concern as to the height of the railings or its lack thereof. Zou Xiong  STB No. 79 of 2016 [19 Shelford Road] \nv Management Corporation Strata \nTitle Plan No. 2360 \n12 The Board accepts that this proposal does not sufficiently overcome the shortcoming of the \ndesign of the railings in the Applicant\u2019s Unit.  \n35. The second alternative provided by the Respondent was to permit the Respondent to\ninstall the invisible grilles onto the existing trellis beams at the balcony of the unit. The main \nconcern surrounding the Applicant\u2019s refusal to accept this proposal was the likelihood that \nmounting the invisible grilles onto the existing trellis beam would be structurally unsafe. As \nsuch, the Applicant engaged a professional engineer to determine the structural safety of the \nRespondent\u2019s second alternative. In accordance with the Applicant\u2019s professional engineer \nreport tendered at the hearing, the professional engineer stated at the end of section 3 of the \nreport that: \n\u201cFor normal design practice, the additional loading due to the cable would not be \nincorporated in the trellis design. Hence, in the event where tension is exerted by the \ncable, the trellis might suffer from over stress. There is a possibility of pulling down \nthe trellis. \u201d  \n36. Although the Applicant\u2019s professional engineer report did not provide a definitive\nconclusion that the Respondent\u2019s second alternative was not viable, it is clear that the \nprofessional engineer had cast doubt on the structural safety of the Respondent\u2019s second \nalternative. Additionally, in the course of the hearing, it became evidently clear that the \nRespondent did not take any steps to ensure that the second alternative was structurally safe \nand does not seemed to have verified with a professional engineer on whether it will be safe to \nmount the invisible grilles on the trellis beams. \n37. The Board acknowledges that, in an attempt to assist the Applicant with the design of\nthe invisible grilles, the Respondent had recommended two contractors to the Applicant. The \nApplicant had actively approached one of the contractors but subsequently realised that the \nsaid contractor could not give a guarantee as to the integrity of the trellis beam structure when \nthe invisible grilles are mounted onto it; the other contractor did not respond to him. Although \nboth contractors were recommended by the Respondent, it is noted that the Respondent does \nnot seemed to have verified with the contractors on whether it will be safe to mount the invisible Zou Xiong   STB No. 79 of 2016 [19 Shelford Road]  \nv Management Corporation Strata  \nTitle Plan No. 2360    \n13 \n grilles on the trellis beams.  \n \n38. Finally, it must be highlighted that the Respondent conceded at the hearing that this \nproposal is not conclusively workable.  \n \n39. The Respondent, in its reply submission, submits that by making recommenda tions to \nother contractors, the Respondent is suggesting that there are other ways to install the invisible \ngrilles and it is not to be construed as directing the Applicant to install the invisible grilles onto \nthe trellis beams. The Board takes the positi on that where the management corporation provides \nalternative proposals after rejecting an applicant\u2019s proposed invisible grilles design, the duty \nlies upon the management corporation to ensure that the alternative proposal given is workable \nand structural ly safe. On the facts, as the Applicant had already produced a professional \nengineer\u2019s report stating that there may be structural safety issues surrounding the \nRespondent\u2019s second alternative, the duty then falls on the Respondent to prove that their \nproposal is both workable and structurally safe. The Respondent must subsequently engage a \nprofessional engineer to certify that their proposal is viable.  \n \n40. The third alternative provided by the Respondent was to permit the Applicant to install \nan acrylic sheet/laminated glass at the balcony railings, up to a height of 5 feet. The Board \nnotes that this by -law was only passed at the 17th AGM dated 26 November 2016, many \nmonths after the current application had commenced. Additionally, the installation of an acrylic \nsheet/laminated glass with a height of 5 feet at the balcony railings had been expressly \nprohibited by the URA as it would be considered an enclosure of the roof terrace. Persuading \nthe Applicant to adopt this proposal amounts to encouraging the Ap plicant to breach the URA\u2019s \nregulations. The Respondent seeks to persuade the Board not to accept the email from URA as \ndefinitive. However, the Respondent has not adduced any concrete evidence to the contrary. In \nthe absence of contrary evidence, the Boar d is inclined to accept the Applicant\u2019s evidence.  \n  \n41. The Board notes that throughout the course of the proceedings, the Respondent made \nno attempts to verify if their proposed alternatives would work. While the Board appreciates \nthat the Respondent is r esponsible for maintaining the facade of the Development, the \nRespondent cannot expect the Applicant to continuously provide different proposals until they Zou Xiong   STB No. 79 of 2016 [19 Shelford Road]  \nv Management Corporation Strata  \nTitle Plan No. 2360    \n14 \n find a design that satisfies the Respondent\u2019s demands.  \n  \n42. Crucially, towards the end of the heari ng, the Respondent\u2019s witness conceded that he \nwas not even aware if any of the three proposed alternatives suggested to the Applicant were \nin fact workable. The Board is of the view that the Respondent, when providing suggestions to \nthe Applicant, must pro vide options which are certified workable and safe by a professional \nengineer. It is pointless to make suggestions which are still subject to trial and error or are not \nviable.  \n \nConclusion  \n43. From the evidence and facts in the present case, we find the f ollowing:  \ni. the Respondent had from the onset, been fully aware of the Applicant\u2019s intention \nto make an application to install invisible grilles at his Unit\u2019s balcony and as \nsuch the Respondent\u2019s rejection of the Applicant\u2019s application on mere \ntechnical grounds is without merit;  \n \nii. the Respondent, being the management corporation of the Development has the \nright to determine whether the Applicant was permitted to install the invisible \ngrilles. By that reason, the Respondent\u2019s submission that in the pres ent case \nonly the general body can give approval for the installation of the invisible \ngrilles is also without merit; and  \n \niii. the Respondent had failed to provide the Applicant with practical and feasible \nalternatives subsequent to rejecting the Applicant\u2019s invisible grilles proposal. \nThe alternatives proposed by the Respondent were neither evidentially \napproved by the URA nor certified structurally safe by a professional engineer. \nBy providing alternatives that are not workable, it essentially am ounts to the \nRespondent not providing the Applicant with any alternatives.  \n \n Zou Xiong   STB No. 79 of 2016 [19 Shelford Road]  \nv Management Corporation Strata  \nTitle Plan No. 2360    \n15 \n 44. The Board recognises that the Respondent has a duty to ensure that the facade of the \nbuilding is consistent. However, it is also the duty of the Respondent to provide design \nguidelines for its subsidiary proprietors to adopt and where the Respondent proposes any \nalternatives, these must be structurally sound, comply with the law and regulations and are \nworkable. Where the proposal concerns structural integrity, the Respondent should  support its \nproposal from appropriate professionals, which in this case, is a professional engineer.  \n \n45. The Board therefore orders that the Respondent shall, within 2 months, allow the \nApplicant to install the invisible grilles at the Applicant\u2019s b alcony  (full height) , in accordance \nwith the Respondent\u2019s proposal, which should take into account structural integrity (as \napproved by a professional engineer nominated by the Respondent) and the facade of the \nbuilding. If the Respondent fails to do so, t he Applicant be allowed to erect the invisible grilles \nas proposed by his contractor, M/S Legate and approved by the Applicant\u2019s professional \nengineer, Wong Yew Fai.  \n \n46. The Board orders that the Respondent pay the Applicant $18,000 and disbursements  to \nbe agreed by parties . \n \n \nMR ALFONSO ANG  \nPresident  \n \nPROF TEO KEANG SOOD  \nMember  \n \nMR LIM PENG HONG  \nMember  \n \nMr. Toh Kok Seng/ Mr. Daniel Chen  (M/s Lee & Lee) for the Applicant . \nMs. Teh Ee -von (M/s Infinitus Law Corporation) for the Respondent .

The Applicants are the MCST Plan No. 2622 of a development called Summerdale \nCondominium  along Boon Lay Drive . This development is approximately 17 years old , \nhaving obtained TOP i n 2001 . In the year 2015, the Applicants conducted a repainting \nexercise in the whole development. This was  a second repainting of the estate since 2009.  \n \n2. In the course of the repainting  in 2015 , six top floor units were found to have water \nseeping from their unit  terrace s onto the external walls of their respective blocks. The \nApplicants asked all  Subsidiary P roprietors  (SPs)  of the six units to re-waterproof their \nunit terrace s so that the painting of the external walls could be completed. F ive SPs \ncomplied with the request and repainting work was comple ted in their respective blocks. MCST Plan No.2622  v Yu Di Wei/ Tong Jian Hua         STB No 70 of 2016  Summerdale  Condominium  \n \n3 \n The Respondents resisted the request and up to date the repainting to their block could \nnot be completed as the paint applied kept running because of water seep age from their \nroof top terrace onto the external walls.  \n \nThe Respondents \u2019 case \n \n3. The Respondents said that the seepage of water onto the external walls was not from their \nroof to p terrace as their water proofing membrane was intact before the painting works \ncommenced in 2015. The Respondents alleged that  if it was the failure of their water \nproofing membrane in their roof top terrace that caused the seepage, the failure was \ncaused by the Applicants\u2019 painters who attached a rope system to their railing and the \ncombined weights of the painters and the rope system on the external walls caused the \nwater proofing membrane at the upturn at the kerb and slab to fail.  \n \nThe Expert\u2019s Evidenc e \n \n4. In view of the Respondents\u2019 position, the Applicants engaged a professional Engineer, \none Er Wilson Goh, to invest igate. In his report, the professional engineer found that the \nwater seepage problem to the external wall is due to the failure of the wate rproofing \nmembrane upturn at the slab and the kerb. He also found another localized waterproofing \nmembrane failure at the terrace which caused water seepage to the units below the \nRespondents\u2019 unit. He was of the view that the failure of the water proofing system is due \nto wear and tear. In his report he also stated that the rope system and the weight of the \nworkers could not cause any damage to the existing structure as the kerb including the \nrailing barrier were designed to cater for heavier  loadings.  \n \n5. In his oral evidence, the professional engineer said that it was unlikely that the rope system \nand the weight of the workers could cause any damage to the water proofing system but \nhe would not rule out the possibility that the external weight s might cause the membrane \nto \u201cstretch\u201d and result in a failure at the upturn.  \n \n6. Respondents did not produce any expert evidence.  \n \nThe Board\u2019s Findings:  \n \n7. The Board accepts the evidence of the professional engineer  and finds his explanation and \nreasoning c redible . \n \n8. The Board finds that the water seepage onto the external walls was from the Respondents\u2019 \nunit and it was a result of the failure of the water proofing membrane in the Respondents\u2019 \nunit roof terrace  due to wear and tear . However, t he Board also finds that the external \nweights of the rope system and the workers had  contributed to the water proofing \nmembrane being stretched and failed as stated by the professional engineer.  \n MCST Plan No.2622  v Yu Di Wei/ Tong Jian Hua         STB No 70 of 2016  Summerdale  Condominium  \n \n4 \n 9. The Board rejects Respondents\u2019 submissions that the water proofing system  is a \u2018fixtu re\u2019 \nand therefore it is the responsibility  of the Applicants to maintain  it. The Board is of the \nview that the water proofing system which is within the Respondents\u2019 unit  roof terrace  is \nfor the  purpose of preventing water from the Respondents\u2019  unit from seeping into other \nSubsidiary Proprietors\u2019 units and the commo n property and it  is the  responsibility  of the \nRespondents to maintain  it in good condition .  \n \nThe Board  Orders  \n \n1. The Board orders  the Respondents  to re-do their water proofing membrane on their roof \nterrace and to prevent water seepage from their unit onto the external walls of the building.  \n \n2. The Board further orders that the Applicants will contribute 50 % of the cost for the \nredoing of the water  proof ing membrane as there were evidence to show that prior to the \n2015 repainting the water proofing membrane was still in working order and it is possible \nfrom the professional engineer\u2019s point of view that the weights of the rope system and \nworkers ha d contribute d to the failure of the membrane at the upturn at the slab and kerb.   \n \nThe Board will hear Parties on costs.  \n \n \n \n________________________  \n        MR SENG KWANG BOON  \n        Deputy President  \n \n         ________________________  \n         ER TONY TAY CHYE TECK  \n         Member  \n \n                ________________________  \n         DR LIM LAN Y UAN  \n         Member  \n \n \n \n \n The Applicant/s in person     \nThe Respondent/s in person  "

This is an application by the Management Corpora tion Strata Title Plan No. 2440 \n(\u201capplicant\u201d) against Mr Ee Min Kiat and Ms Eileen Tan @ Tan Ai Lian \n(\u201crespondents\u201d), for the Board to order the respond ents to remove unauthorised \nadditions and/or alterations carried out at the res pondents\u2019 lot at 70 Farrer Road \n#03-02 Gallop Gables, Singapore 268850 and thereaft er to reinstate and restore the \nlot to its original condition. \nBackground \n2. The applicant is the management corporation (\u201cMC \u201d) of a residential development \ncomprising 140 residential lots, known as Gallop Ga bles, situated at Farrer Road, \nSingapore. The respondents are subsidiary proprieto rs of a strata lot in the \ndevelopment. \n3. Gallop Gables was developed in 1997. According t o the respondents, the original \nwindows and sliding door at the balcony of their lo t were in a very poor condition \nwhen a renovation application form was submitted to  the MC on the 24 June 2013. \nThe application was for other renovations in additi on to the windows and sliding \ndoor at the balcony. In the column where the respon dents were to provide a \ndescription of the works in connection with the ren ovation of the windows and \nsliding door they entered \nPossible sliding door and window frame \n4. With regard to the poor condition of the windows  and sliding door, it was said that \nthere was discoloration of the window casements and  sliding door frames; damaged \nrubber linings of the windows and door; water seepa ge from the windows and door; \nimproper functioning due to age - unable to secure and close properly, resulting in a \nsafety risk. \n5. On 3 July 2013, Ms Kuah Beng Hui (\u201cKBH\u201d), a repr esentative of the managing \nagent (\u201cMA\u201d), spoke to co-respondent Ms Eileen Tan (\u201cET\u201d) and requested that the \nproposed design for the sliding door at the balcony  be submitted for approval before STB 21 of 2016 \u2013 Gallop Gables     Page 3 of 23 \n proceeding with the works. There is no evidence tha t this was done and on 5 July \n2013, KBH spoke to ET in connection with the replac ements. After the conversation, \nKBH sent an email to ET. Inter alia ET was informed  \u201cWe are very consistent with \nthe fa\u00e7ade of the estate. We do this to maintain th e look of the estate and protect \nthe integrity of the design and the intended materi al used by the architect who \ndesigned the estate. As such no variation in the ma terial, design, look and finish will \nbe permitted.\u201d  \n6. ET sent a reply on the same day. Inter alia she said \u201c I am 100% in agreement to the \nfacade requires by the management and it is also ou r utmost interest to protect the \nintegrity of the design and the value of the estate . However in regards to the \nmaterial use, how can management stop me from using  a far superior material that \ngives the fa\u00e7ade a longer life span without comprom ising the current outlook\u2026 \nAppreciate if you could highlight to me under which  by law where the type of \nmaterial is allowed specifically\u201d. She continued by asking if the by-law mentioned \nthat only painted/ powdered aluminum could be used and queried the strength of \nthe aluminum  \n7. According to ET, on 9 July 2013, one Simon Lee ( \u201cSL\u201d), whom she said was KBH\u2019s \nsuperior, apologised to her and said that there wer e no provisions in the by-laws \nand house rules in connection with materials that w ere to be used for replacements \nand agreed to the respondents\u2019 proposals after the respondent reiterated that there \nwould be no noticeable differences between the repl acements for the original \nwindows and door and the original. On the same day KBH sent an email to ET. Inter \nalia KBH said \u201c\u2026 We refer to your conversation with Simon and yourse lf this \nafternoon. As requested we attached the following p hotos comparing the current \nand proposed material and design. We thank you for your understanding to use \npowder coated (white) aluminum for the balcony door s and windows\u201d. According to \nET, this (use of aluminum) was contrary to what was  agreed between her and SL \nand on the same day she, inter alia responded \u201c\u2026 we wish to assure you that the \noverall fa\u00e7ade of the estate will not be affected a s there will be no different in \ndesign/look/colours to the overall appearance to th e existing design\u2026even if we use STB 21 of 2016 \u2013 Gallop Gables     Page 4 of 23 \n aluminum, there is no guarantee that we can find so mething 100% identical\u2026Also \nwe assure you that nobody will notice any differenc e to the material use either it is \naluminum or PVC unless you physically come and touc h it\u2026We are talking of the \nfa\u00e7ade of the building, and not the fine details\u2026.\u201d . On 10 July 2013, ET sent an \nemail defining and confirming the respondents\u2019 stan d \u201c\u2026 we are not using \naluminum, we are using fersina window with the same  design and colour as the \nexisting window\u201d.  \n8. KBH, on 17 July 2013, inter alia informed ET \u201c\u2026 we appreciate your assurance that \nthe fa\u00e7ade of the estate will not be affected\u2026the c hange of the windows and \nbalcony doors need to comply with the by-laws of th e estate .\u201d ET\u2019s  attention was \ndrawn to the By-laws of the estate (\u201cEBL\u201d) \u201c\u2026 Para 6.7.1 Any work, which may affect \nthe external fa\u00e7ade of the building, shall not be c arried out without prior approval \nfrom the Management \u2026.6.7.2 The SP shall not erect any structure or make any \nalteration to the external fa\u00e7ade without the prior  written consent of the \nManagement\u2026.6.7.4 The existing designs and opening styles of all windows, doors \nand fences as designed by the architects of the est ate shall remain status quo and \nshall not be changed.\u201d KBH went on to inform that whilst ET had not been s topped \nfrom replacing the balcony windows and doors, the r eplacements had to comply \nwith the by-laws. ET was informed that her request for her proposal to be forwarded \nto the MC would be accommodated and that the counci l was not in a position to \ndecide on the respondents\u2019 alterations and that she  was required  \u201cto seek the \nHouse\u2019s approval at the Annual General Meeting. In the meantime, you should not \nproceed with the proposed installation if they do n ot comply with the rules\u2026\u201d.  ET \nreplied on 18 July 2013 that by-laws 6.7, 6.7.2, an d 6.7.4 had been complied with \nand continued \u201c\u2026 We have already repeatedly told you the fa\u00e7ade of t he estate will \nnot be compromised. It seems you have a understandi ng problem what it means by \nfa\u00e7ade of the estate. Also we had in our last email  informing you that the sliding \ndoor in the living room and some of the windows are  already giving problems. Are \nyou asking me to wait and not to proceed with the r eplacements till your Annual \nGeneral Meeting? And God knows when the Annual Gene ral Meeting is going to be. \nAre you going to responsible for the damage if ther e is water seepage or break in STB 21 of 2016 \u2013 Gallop Gables     Page 5 of 23 \n into my apartment if should that happen? And not to  forget we are giving only sixty \ndays to complete the renovations.\u201d  \n9. On 25 July 2013, KBH, via an email, informed tha t during a routine inspection it was \nnoted respondents had removed their balcony doors. ET was further informed \n\u201c\u2026Please take note that the issue with regard to the material and type of groove \nlines has yet to be resolved . We will not stop anyone from changing their door bu t \nwe wish to reiterate that the changes should not de viate from the original \nspecification. We understand that you have some pro blem finding the type of \nmaterial (Aluminum) and instead proposed the \u201cFersi na Windows\u2019 as well as the \ngrooved line. We will like to assist by checking wi th some of our contractors if they \nare able to help source the aluminum balcony door a nd aluminum window with \ngrooved lines. We understand your situation and we wish to pre-empt that if you \nproceed to install your balcony door with the \u2018Fers ina Windows\u2019 and that in the \nevent of queries or challenges raised by the member s of the House, there may be a \nneed to substantial the changes in the material and  probable consequences too.\u201d  \n10. According to ET, KBH could not find a source th at could supply aluminum balcony \ndoors and windows with grooved lines and in view of  the timeline allowed for the \ncompletion of the renovation works, the respondents  proceeded to carry on with the \nrenovations. Work commenced on or about 8 August 20 13. \n11. On 19 August 2013, KBH sent an email to the res pondents. The contents were \nsimilar to that of the email sent on 25 July 2013 \u201c \u2026we noticed that your contractors \nare in the process of removing the windows. We unde rstand that the windows will \nbe changed to \u2018Fersina Windows\u2019. We would like to r eiterate that the issue with \nregard to the type of material and grooved lines ha s yet to be resolved. We will not \nstop anyone from changing their windows but we wish  to reiterate that the changes \nshould not deviate from the original specification. \u201d KBH went on to inform that the \ncouncil wanted to have a meet up session with the r espondents. The respondents \nmet up with members of the council on 26 August 201 3 and at the meeting the \nrespondents were invited to table the matter at the  upcoming 13 th  AGM. STB 21 of 2016 \u2013 Gallop Gables     Page 6 of 23 \n 12. It is recorded in the Minutes of the 4 th  Council Meeting of the 12 th  Management \nCouncil  held on 26 August 2013 that the respondents had pr esented their reasons \nfor changing the balcony doors and windows from the  current aluminum frames to \nFersina Window frames and the respondents\u2019 attentio n was drawn to Clause 6.7.4 \nof the By-Laws which provides \u201c The existing designs and opening styles of all \nwindows doors and fences as designed by the archite cts of the estate shall remain \nstatus quo and shall not be changed\u201d . It is recorded that the council was prepared to \ntable the matter with regard to balcony doors and w indows at the coming 13 th  AGM \nand the co-respondent, Mr Ee Min Kiat (\u201cEMK\u201d), assu red the council that he and his \nwife would adhere to the decision made at the AGM. \n13. Following the meeting with the council on 26 Au gust 2013, it is the case for the \nrespondents that there was no further correspondenc e between them and the MC \nor objections from anyone until the completion of t he renovation works in \nSeptember 2013. \n14. On 17 March 2014, KBH, on behalf of the MA, wro te to the respondents and \nreferred to the meeting with the council members on  the 26 August 2013. Inter alia, \nshe referred to the fact that the respondents had i nstalled balcony sliding doors and \nwindows that differed from the original. Details wi th regard to the differences were \nitemised .  \n The differences were as follows: \n \u201c1. Your balcony sliding doors vary from the origi nal, i.e.,                                             \n (a) the way the balcony doors are collapsed. Only two of the four balcony doors are \n collapsible. They can now be opened only in the ce ntre instead of on both sides. \n We note that only two doors are collapsible instea d of being collapsed and stacked \n to one pane on either side of the balcony door ope ning.                 \n (b) the doors are now aligned to rather than reces sed with the top glass panel \n windows,                                                                                                                       \n (c) the centre vertical panel of the top panel win dow is smaller than the original,                             STB 21 of 2016 \u2013 Gallop Gables     Page 7 of 23 \n  (d) the sides of the top panel windows and doors a re broader than the original top \n panel windows and doors,                                                                                           \n (e) the size of the glass panes are smaller than t he original,                                       \n (f) there are two tracks instead of four tracks in  the original design and                 \n (g) the construction material used is polyvinylchl oride instead of aluminum \n 2. The windows at your apartment vary from the ori ginal i.e.                                    \n (a) the centre vertical panel of the window is sma ller than the original,                \n (b) the sides of the windows are broader than the original windows and               \n (c) the glass panes are smaller than the original doors and windows.                 \n (d) the construction material used id polyvinylchl oride instead of aluminum. Please \n see photo attached.\u201d \n15. The respondents were advised to table a resolut ion at the AGM scheduled on 26 \nApril 2014 in connection with the variations made b y the respondents to their \nbalcony doors and windows. A reply was sent by the respondents on the 27 March \n2014. In the reply, the respondents said that they had previously informed that it \nwas not possible to replace their balcony doors and  windows with doors and \nwindows that were identical to the original; that t hey had to replace their doors and \nwindows because they old, discolored, unsightly, co uld not be closed properly and \nhad been given 60 days to complete renovation works . For these reasons and also \nbecause they were not informed as to the date of th e next AGM, they could not \naccept the suggestion to postpone their renovations  until the next AGM. It was also \ntheir view that the differences between the newly i nstalled balcony doors and \nwindows and the original were minor. KBH, on behalf  of the MA, sent a letter to the \nrespondents on 14 April 2014. Inter alia, she refer red to the respondents\u2019 view that \nthe differences between the newly installed balcony  doors and windows were minor \nand explained that \u201c\u2026 we are not in a position to assume that the general  body \n(House) would perceive the variances to the fa\u00e7ade in the same way. This is STB 21 of 2016 \u2013 Gallop Gables     Page 8 of 23 \n precisely the reason why we all agreed with you to seek the consent from the \nHouse for the variances at the AGM\u201d. \n16. At the AGM on 26 April 2014, the meeting discus sed the variations made by the \nrespondents to the aluminum windows and balcony sli ding doors. Inter alia, there \nwere comments with regard to \u201c integrity of the fa\u00e7ade; integrity of the estate; c urrent \nregulations governing the fa\u00e7ade are comprehensive and encompassing; value of \nthe property\u201d. The chairperson also shared that \u201c Apart from material, if the design is \nmaintained and there is no deviation visually a dif ferent material may be accepted. \nBut unfortunately in this case the design is differ ent\u201d. The Board notes that the \ncomment was in order as it did not appear that ther e are any prohibitions in the by-\nlaws in connection with materials used.  \n17. One of the subsidiary proprietors viz Roland Fe ser (\u201cAW2\u201d), who was present at the \nmeeting, testified at the hearing before the Board.  He, after being shown \nphotographs of the variations carried out to the sl iding doors and windows at the \nrespondents unit, expressed his view that the desig n of the balcony sliding door \nseemed different from the other units and that it w ould affect the fa\u00e7ade and the \nvalue of the property. Another subsidiary proprieto r, Leong Chung Yan (\u201cAW3A\u201d), \nnoted that it was evident that the balcony sliding doors windows differed from the \nother surrounding units. Ngiau Marn Lai (\u2018AW1\u201d), wh o is also a subsidiary proprietor \nin the estate, testified that she has noted the eff ects of the renovation carried out by \nthe respondents when walking around the estate \u2013 the fa\u00e7ade of the respondents\u2019 \nstrata lot differs from the neighbouring strata lot s. \n18. The decision, taken after the discussion at the  AGM on 26 April 2014, was  \n\u201cThe approach is to speak to the owner concerned an d remind them of the by-laws. \nFailing which legal counsel would be sought and act ion was to be taken on this \nmatter to get them to reinstate the windows and bal cony doors to the original \ndesign\u201d   \n STB 21 of 2016 \u2013 Gallop Gables     Page 9 of 23 \n Applicant\u2019s Case  \n19. The applicant has applied for orders for the re spondents to remove the:                                                       \ni)  polyvinylchloride window casements;                                                                                       \nii)  polyvinylchloride sliding door frame with two sliding tracks;                                              \niii)  balcony sliding doors; and                                                                                               \niv)  top layer windows that are flushed with the ba lcony sliding doors.  \nFollowing the removal of the aforementioned items, the applicant wants the \nrespondents to reinstate the items removed with:                                                    \ni-i)  powder coated aluminum window casements with dimensions that are set out in \n  a drawing that was annexed at Form 9;                                                                           \nii-i)  powder coated aluminum sliding door frames w ith four sliding tracks with \n dimensions that are set out in a drawing that was annexed at Form 9 ;                                 \niii-i) powder coated aluminum sliding doors that ar e collapsible on either side with \n dimensions that are set out in a drawing that was annexed at Form 9; and                 \niv-i) top layer windows that are recessed against t he sliding door with dimensions   \n that are set out in a drawing that was annexed at Form 9. \n20. It is the case for the applicant that the annex ed drawings evidence the original \ndimensions. Tan Boong Ping (\u201cAW4A\u201d), a registered s urveyor, took measurements \nof the sliding doors and windows of four other lots  in the estate and confirmed that \nthe measurements tallied with the drawings. \n21. The grounds for the application were that                                                                     \ni)  the renovations had affected the external fa\u00e7ad e without prior approval from the \nmanagement (EBL 6.7.1 and 6.7.2); \nii) the design and opening style of the windows and  door had been changed (EBL \n 6.7.4);       \niii) there was a breach of By-Law 5(4) of the presc ribed by-laws in the 2 nd  Schedule \n of the Building Maintenance (Strata Management) Re gulations 2005 (\u201cthe STB 21 of 2016 \u2013 Gallop Gables     Page 10 of 23 \n  prescribed by-laws\u201d) which required that locking d evices, safety devices, \n screens, other devices and structures installed must have an appearance\u2026in \n keeping with such guidelines as the management cor poration may prescribe \n regarding such installations and with the appearan ce of the rest of the building ; \niv) there was no authorisation from the MC for impr ovements  which had affected \n the appearance of the building (S37(3) and (4) of the Building Maintenance and \n Strata Management Act (\u201cAct\u201d)). \n22. It is the case for the applicant that it was ap parent that the works had affected the \nuniformity of the external appearance of the buildi ng. In particular, the sliding doors \nwere noticeably different in appearance from the or iginal condition. \nRespondents\u2019 Case  \n23. The respondents opposed the application on the grounds that there were no \nbreaches of the by-law of the estate; no breach of the prescribed by-laws in the \nSecond Schedule of the Building Maintenance (Strata  Management) Regulations \n2005; there was no breach of S37(3) of the Act; the  making of the orders sought by \nthe applicants would cause hardship to the responde nts without any corresponding \nbenefit to the applicants. \n24. In connection with the by-laws of the estate, i t was submitted that the windows and \nsliding doors where work had been done were set bac k from and not part of the \nbalcony and accordingly the fa\u00e7ade was not affected . It was also submitted that the \ndifferences resulting from the works done, if not s pecifically pointed out, could not \nbe noted by a casual observer; were not observable from the ground level; the \nabsence of groove lines on the windows and the slid ing tracks of the balcony door \ncould not be seen unless one was viewing these when  one was less than one metre \naway and was standing on the balcony. It was submit ted that the differences were \nin harmony/agreement with the fa\u00e7ade of the estate.  \n25. The respondents elicited evidence from Poon Chi p Wah (\u201cRW2\u201d), a registered \narchitect, who expressed the view that from an arch itectural point of view, there was STB 21 of 2016 \u2013 Gallop Gables     Page 11 of 23 \n very little difference between the works and other strata units.  He also found it hard \nto understand how a casual observer would be able to spot the dif ference between \nthe works and the other strata units.  It was his evidence that, from an architectural \nstandpoint, design elements and components that aff ected fa\u00e7ade would comprise \nsignificant design changes to elements and componen ts \n26. In connection with the sliding doors, where the re was no dispute that there was a \nchange in opening style from the original, it was s ubmitted that this was a matter of \nfunction and would not affect the fa\u00e7ade in any way  or have any visual impact.   \n27. In connection with the prescribed by-laws, it w as submitted that by-law 5.4, of the \nprescribed by-laws, were applicable to locking or s afety devices, screens and other \nstructures installed on common property. As the win dows and doors replaced by the \nrespondents were not on common property, there was no breach of this by-law. \n(The applicant did not make any submissions in conn ection with by-law 5.4 of the \nprescribed by-laws). It was also the respondents\u2019 c ase that the condition of the \noriginal windows and doors were such that they coul d not be securely shut and \nlocked and exposed the respondents to a significant  security risk of intrusion. \n28. In connection with S37(3) of the Act, it was al so submitted that the MC and MA \nhave unreasonably withheld authority/approval for t he installations.  It was submitted \nthat the respondents had complied with the by-laws before commencing the \ninstallations and because there were no provisions in the by-laws with regard to \nmaterials, four sliding tracks, recessed top layer windows the respondents\u2019 \ninstallations were not out of order. It was also su bmitted that because subsidiary \nproprietors when installing grills, had to comply w ith approved designs and \nspecifications which were spelt out in the by-laws,  specifications for designs and \nfinishes of original windows and doors were not in the by-laws and accordingly it is \nthus clear that strict compliance with the design a nd finish of the original windows \nand door unlike that for the installation of grills  was not required.  \n29. It was further submitted that even if the exter nal appearance and fa\u00e7ade was \naffected, it was in order for the respondents to ha ve executed the installation STB 21 of 2016 \u2013 Gallop Gables     Page 12 of 23 \n because there were safety considerations (the origi nal windows and doors could not \nbe securely shut).  \n30. It was submitted that there would be no real be nefit for the orders sought by the \napplicant to be made because uniformity was no long er possible as other subsidiary \nproprietors had made alterations that had affected the fa\u00e7ade and there were \ntemporary structures or items place on balconies of  other units that were more \nvisible and obvious than the respondents\u2019 installat ions. It was also submitted that \nthe minor differences resulting from the installati ons could have no impact on the \nvalue of the estate. Costs had been incurred in com pleting the works and forcing \nthe respondents to restore the original windows and  doors would place the \nrespondents in an unfairly prejudicial position wit h no corresponding benefit to the \napplicant. \n31. It was the final submission of the respondents that they have been unfairly, and for \nno reason, singled out by the applicant. \nThe Issues  \n32. It is not in dispute that renovations/alteratio ns had been done by the respondents to \ntheir windows and balcony doors and that the works carried out had resulted in \ndifferences between the original condition and cond ition after the works had been \ncarried out. The differences as itemised in the let ter written by KBH dated 17 March \n2014 were not disputed or challenged by the respond ents. \n33. The Board proceeded to determine if the respond ents had carried out \nrenovations/alterations that were unauthorised and in breach of the by-laws of the \nestate and S37(3) of the Act and in the event that this had been done, whether \norders of removal and reinstatement should be made.  \nDECISION \n34. It is not in dispute that the by-laws of the es tate were properly made under S32 of \nthe Act and that they bind the MC and the subsidiar y proprietors as if they had been \nsigned and sealed by the MC and the subsidiary prop rietors and contained mutual STB 21 of 2016 \u2013 Gallop Gables     Page 13 of 23 \n covenants to observe, comply and perform all the pr ovisions of the by-laws. They \nconstitute a statutory contract between the MC and the subsidiary proprietors and \nbetween subsidiary proprietors inter se.  (see Choo Kok Lin v MCST Plan 2405 \n[2005] 4 SLR(R) 175 ) \n35. S 37(3) and (4) of the Act are a statutory prov ision prohibiting subsidiary proprietors \nfrom effecting improvements in or upon a lot that a ffects the appearance of the \nbuilding and it is clear from the provisions that i t was the intention of parliament that \nanyone who intends to purchase one or more lots in a strata titled development \nshould not carry out any alterations/ renovations t hat affects the appearance of the \nbuilding i.e . it is expected that all the lots should be unifor m. Parliament could not \nhave made its intentions clearer than what is set o ut in S37(3) and (4) of the Act \nS37 -  \n(3) Except pursuant to an authority granted under s ubsection (4) no subsidiary \n proprietor of a lot that is comprised in a strata title plan shall effect any improvement \n in or upon his lot for his benefit which affect th e appearance of any building \n comprised in the strata title plan. \n(4) A management corporation may at the request of a subsidiary proprietor of any \n lot comprised in its strata title plan and upon su ch terms as it considers appropriate, \n authorise the subsidiary proprietor to to effect a ny improvement in or upon his lot \n referred to in subsection (3) if the management co rporation is satisfied that the \n improvement in or upon the lot \u2013  \n(a) will not detract from the appearance of any of the buildings comprised in the \n strata title plan or will be in keeping with the r est of the buildings ; and  \n(b) will not affect the structural integrity of any  of the buildings in the strata title plan \n36.  Subsidiary proprietors are not prohibited from  making improvements that may affect \n the appearance of the building but before them bef ore proceeding to do so, \n Parliament required that they had to first obtain authority from the MC to do so.  STB 21 of 2016 \u2013 Gallop Gables     Page 14 of 23 \n  The MC before granting or refusing its approval wo uld  consider if the improvement \nwould detract from the appearance of any of the bui ldings or would be in keeping \nwith the rest of the buildings  \n37. In almost every development, there would be by- laws that require subsidiary \nproprietors to submit an application before any alt eration/renovation is carried out.  \nThe by-laws of the estate i.e. EBL 6.7.1, 6.7.2, and 6.7.4 are in keeping with S3 7 of \nthe Act. This would be for the purpose of enabling the MC to have sight and \nconsider the proposed alteration/renovation and det ermine if it would affect the \nappearance of the building. \n38. Where a subsidiary proprietor intends to carry out an improvement that can affect \nthe appearance of the building, it will not be in o rder for subsidiary proprietor to \nproceed to do so before approval has been granted i n accordance with the by-laws. \nTo do so, before approval has been obtained in acco rdance with the by-laws, would \nbe in breach of the Act and in breach of the statut ory contract between the MC and \nthe subsidiary proprietors. \n39. Where there is an application for renovation/al teration of a lot which does affect the \nappearance of the building but does not detract fro m the appearance of the building \nor is in keeping with the rest of the buildings and  will not affect the structural \nintegrity of the building, the application should b e approved (S37(4) of the Act). \nShould a MC deny the granting of approval in such a  case this would qualify as a \nfailure to exercise or perform a power or duty conf erred or imposed by the Act and \nthe subsidiary proprietors can obtain a remedy unde r S101(1)(c) of the Act. \n40. It will be in order to set out the applicable b y-laws: \n6.7.1. Any work which may affect the external fa\u00e7ad e of the building shall not be \n carried out without prior approval from the Manage ment. Facade shall \n include windows, awnings, *grills, balcony compart ments for air-con \n condensing units, common areas, open areas and all  other visible parts of \n the building which consume or form part of the ext ernal appearance of the \n building.                                                                                                                          STB 21 of 2016 \u2013 Gallop Gables     Page 15 of 23 \n  *All works involving grills must comply with the b y-laws governing installation \n of grill. \n 6.7.2  The SP shall not erect any structure or mak e any alteration to the external  \n  fa\u00e7ade without the prior written consent of the M anagement. \n 6.7.4  The existing designs and opening styles of all windows, doors and fences  \n  as designed by the architects of the estate shall  remain status quo and  \n  shall not be changed. \n41.  There is no ambiguity in the provisions. The M C and subsidiary proprietors had \n decided that they would be governed by a scheme wh ere  \n i) work which may affect the external fa\u00e7ade of the buildin g cannot be carried out \n unless prior approval had been obtained from the m anagement;  \n ii) prior written consent from the management must  be obtained before subsidiary \n proprietors can erect structures or make alteratio ns to the external fa\u00e7ade;  \n iii) the existing designs and opening styles of al l windows, doors and fences as \n designed by the architects of the estate cannot be  changed. \n42. In this case, the respondents had never obtaine d approval from the management to \ncarry out work which may affect the external fa\u00e7ade of the buildin g; the respondents \ndid not have written consent from the management to  erect structures or make \nalterations to the external fa\u00e7ade.  \n43. Renovations/alterations had been done by the re spondents to their windows and \nbalcony doors and that the works carried out had re sulted in differences, as \nitemised in the letter written by KBH dated 17/03/1 4 between the original condition \nand the condition after the works had been carried out. \nWas there a breach of the applicable by-laws and S3 7(3) of the Act?  \n44. It is the case for the applicant that it was ap parent that the works carried out by the \nrespondents had affected the uniformity of the exte rnal appearance of the building. \nThere was a breach of EBL 6.7.1, 6.7.2, 6, 7.4 and S37(3) of the Act. The external STB 21 of 2016 \u2013 Gallop Gables     Page 16 of 23 \n appearance of a lot is the appearance which the lot presents to a person o utside it \nwho might reasonably be able to view it  \u2013 Re Saunders 1993 2 Qd R 335. There \nwas evidence from three subsidiary proprietors in t he estate who could notice that \nthe respondents\u2019 lot was different from the others.  \n45. The respondents submitted that the windows and sliding doors where work had \nbeen done were set back from and not part of the ba lcony and accordingly the \nfa\u00e7ade was not affected. The Board is of the view t hat the fa\u00e7ade of a building can \nbe affected when windows and sliding doors are set back from and are not a part of \nthe balcony. The definition of \u201cfa\u00e7ade\u201d is the front of a building (\u201cOxford Advanced \nLearners Dictionary\u201d). The sliding doors and window s are at the front of the lot and \nthe fa\u00e7ade would be affected when there are changes  made to the sliding doors and \nwindows. Also in this case the estate\u2019s by-laws spe cifically provided for the fa\u00e7ade \nto include visible parts of the building which constitute or f orm part of the external \nappearance of the building.  \n46. The respondents submitted the differences resul ting from the works done, if not \nspecifically pointed out were not noticeable by a c asual observer and were in \nharmony/agreement with the fa\u00e7ade of the estate. Wh ilst the evidence of the \nwitnesses for the respondents supports the submissi on of the respondents, the \nevidence of the witnesses for the applicant is othe rwise. \n47. District Judge Tan Boon Khai in MCST Plan No 1786 v Huang Hsiang Shui [2006] \nSGDC 20  had the following to say in connection with determ ining whether the \nfa\u00e7ade had been altered -  \n\u201cIn my view, this was essentially a factual exercis e, undertaken by comparing the \nPremises with other similar units in the Developmen t, and against the original \nfa\u00e7ade,  and determining the extent of the change, if any, that had been made\u201d \n48. Before this matter was fixed for an arbitration  hearing, the members of the Board \nhad visited the estate to view the renovations carr ied out by the respondents. From \nwhat we saw and from the photographs exhibited in t his case, it cannot be said that STB 21 of 2016 \u2013 Gallop Gables     Page 17 of 23 \n the differences between the respondents unit and th e others were glaringly \ndifferent. The differences were however not unnotic eable.  \n49. There is no dispute that there are in fact diff erences. According to the calculations \nof RW2, it was 8.97% (in RW2\u2019s report the percentag e was 7.25% and it was \ncorrected during cross examination) in the case of the window frames and 1.2% in \nthe case of the sliding door frames. The applicant has, in its written submission, \ndemonstrated that higher percentages would, dependi ng on methods adopted for a \ncomparison, be obtained. The fact is that there are  differences and it was submitted \nby the applicant \u201c if subsidiary proprietors are all individually allo wed to make \nmarginal changes that do not result in a variance o f more than 7% from the original \ncondition, such marginal changes when viewed in the ir totality will result in the \ndevelopment very quickly losing its uniform appeara nce. It is a slippery slope that \nthe MCST cannot afford to go down.\u201d  At least three of the subsidiary proprietors of \nthe estate who could see the differences were conce rned to the extent that they \nwere prepared to testify before the Board. The Boar d is of the view that due regard \nhad to be given to their evidence.  \n50. The Board is satisfied that the renovations car ried out by the respondents had \naffected the uniformity of the external appearance of the building.  \n51. It was submitted by the respondents that compli ance with the design and finishes of \nthe original windows and doors are not required bec ause there are no specifications \nfor the designs and finishes of such in the by-laws . It is correct that unlike grills, \nspecifications of designs and finishes of the windo ws and doors are not in the by-\nlaws. Grills were not installed by the developer an d subsidiary proprietors who want \nto install such are not prohibited from doing so. T hey have, however, to comply with \nthe design specifications set out in the by-laws in  order that the \u201c uniformity of the \nbuilding fa\u00e7ade\u201d would be maintained. The fact that specifications f or designs and \nfinishes of windows and doors are not in the by-law s is not a license to carry out \nrenovations/alterations that are different or not i n keeping with the original. It is \nprovided in the by-laws that works that affected th e external fa\u00e7ade cannot be \ncarried out without prior permission from the manag ement.  STB 21 of 2016 \u2013 Gallop Gables     Page 18 of 23 \n 52. It will be in order to note that the dimensions  in the drawings annexed in Form 9 \nwere annexed when the original application was amen ded. An application to amend \nwas made, when the Board, before the matter was fix ed for arbitration hearing, \nnoted that the applicant had originally applied for  an order to reinstate and restore at \ntheir own costs the respective areas to its original condition.  The Board had then \nexpressed concern as to how its order could be comp lied with in the event the order \nwas made. It was in these circumstances that the ap plication was amended and the \ndrawings annexed. The dimensions in the drawings wi ll enable easy compliance \nrather than require the obtaining of dimensions (wi th the possibility of inaccurate \ndimensions being obtained) after an order is made b y the Board. \n53. The respondents also submitted that the applica nt had unreasonably withheld \napproval for the installations. The Board cannot, i n view of the applicant\u2019s concern \nwith \u201c integrity of the fa\u00e7ade; integrity of the estate; c urrent regulations governing the \nfa\u00e7ade are comprehensive and encompassing; value of  the property\u201d, find that \napproval had been unreasonably withheld. \n54. It was also submitted that it was in order to e xecute the installations because of \nsafety considerations. The Board is of the view tha t whilst it was not out of order to \nreplace the original windows and doors there was ho wever no necessity to do work \nthat will affect the external fa\u00e7ade and change the  original designs, dimensions and \nopening styles. \nShould the orders applied for be made? \n55. Applications for orders for subsidiary propriet ors to remove unauthorised renovation \nworks and reinstate the premises to its original co ndition have been dealt with by \nprevious Boards. In arriving at a decision, the Boa rd would be guided by the law in \nconnection with granting a mandatory injunction to redress a breach of a negative \ncovenant. There is no dispute or ambiguity on this point and it will be sufficient to \nrefer to the judgment of Chao Hick Tin J (as he the n was) in  Management \nCorporation Strata Title Plan No 1378 v Chen Ee Yue h Rachel [1993] 3 SLR(R) 630  \n(\u201cthe Rachel Chen case\u201d). STB 21 of 2016 \u2013 Gallop Gables     Page 19 of 23 \n 56. In the Rachel Chen case, the court was concerne d with by-laws passed with the \nobject of maintaining the external appearance of th e building. The subsidiary \nproprietor had, without prior written approval from  the MC, removed awnings of the \nbuilding and flower troughs affixed to the external  walls and replaced the metal grills \nat her balcony with sliding glass windows to keep o ut the rain and enjoy her \nbalcony. Approval was subsequently sought from the MC for what had been done. \nThe request was refused on the ground that the addi tions and alterations had \nsubstantially and adversely affected the fa\u00e7ade of the building and an application \nwas made for a mandatory injunction requiring the s ubsidiary proprietor to remove \nthe windows and louvres enclosing the front balcony  and restore the external wall to \nits original condition. The court found that the ov erall appearance of the building had \nbeen affected but on the facts in that case did not  grant the injunction sought.At \nparagraphs 21 and 22, the court said: \n\u201c21. I come now to the final question, whether in t he circumstances of this case, I \nought to order the removal of the windows. Many cas es were cited to me \u2026no \ndoubt helpful in a general sort of way. They lay do wn that, generally, a mandatory \ninjunction will not be issued unless very serious d amage will ensue from withholding \nan injunction. \n 22. The only case which comes close to the fact-situati on of our present case is a \n decision from New South Wales, Australia: Propriet ors Strata Plan No 464 v Oborn  \n [1975] 2 CCH Strata Title Law & Practice 50 at par a 201, decided by Holland J in \n the equity division.... Holland J, having reviewed   the authorities, said: \n The general principle to be extracted from these c ases is that the court will grant a \n mandatory injunction to redress a breach of a nega tive covenant, the breach of \n which is already accomplished, unless: \n (a)    the plaintiff\u2019s own conduct would make it u njust to do so; or \n (b)    the breach is trivial or has caused no dama ge or no appreciable damage to the \n plaintiff and a mandatory injunction would impose substantial hardship on the \n defendant with no counterbalancing benefit to the plaintiff.\u201d STB 21 of 2016 \u2013 Gallop Gables     Page 20 of 23 \n Was the MC unjust in this case? \n57. From the outset, it was clear that the MC was c oncerned with fa\u00e7ade of the estate; \nmaintaining the look of the estate; and protecting the integrity of the design. Before \nbeginning their renovations, the respondents had gi ven an assurance that the \nfa\u00e7ade would not be affected. The assurance of the respondents that the fa\u00e7ade \nwould not be affected was appreciated and they were  reminded that changes made \nto the windows and doors had to comply with the by- laws  \n58. The respondents had in addition to using differ ent materials, changed the design \nand dimensions of the windows and sliding doors. \n59. The respondents do not deny that there are diff erences in the windows and doors \ninstalled by them from the original windows and doo r. It is their case that the \ndifferences are not noticeable. The respondents had , at 4 th  Council Meeting of the \n12 th  Management Council held on 26 August 2013, given a n assurance as follows: \n\u201cFurther, Mr Ee also assured the Council that he an d his wife would adhere to the \ndecision made by the House during the Annual Genera l Meeting on the change of \nall balcony doors and windows.\u201d \n60. In his evidence before the Board, EMK denied th at he had given the assurance and \nsaid that the assurance that he had given was an as surance that in the event the \nMC made a decision in the future to change all the windows in the estate, including \na change of colour, he would comply with this. \n61. The assurance given at the meeting on 26 August  2013 was referred to in a letter \ndated 17 March 2014 from MC to the respondents. Int er alia, the letter was as \nfollows: \n\u201cAt the meeting on 26 August 2013, you gave your ass urance to the Council that the \nfollowing will be complied with: \n1. To adhere to the decision made by the House at t he coming Annual General \nMeeting concerning the variations made to your balc ony doors and windows;\u2026.\u201d \n62. In the minutes of the 13 th  AGM held on 26 April 2014, it is recorded: STB 21 of 2016 \u2013 Gallop Gables     Page 21 of 23 \n \u201cThe meeting was informed that the owner (the respondents) was unavailable for \nthis AGM as they were on holiday. The House was inf ormed that during a prior \nmeeting with the Council, the SP had agreed that if  the House did not approve of \nthe variation, they would reinstate the original de sign of the estate\u2019s windows and \nbalcony doors\u201d \n63. Until he appeared before the Board on 24 Januar y 2017, EMK had never denied nor \nchallenged the accuracy of the minutes of the 4 th  Council Meeting and 13 th  AGM. \n64. The Board does not accept his evidence that the  assurance he gave at the meeting \non 26 August 2013 was an assurance that in the even t that the MC made a decision \nin the future to change all the windows in the esta te, including a change of colour, \nhe would comply with this. \n65. There is, in this case, no evidence that any of  the decisions of the applicant were \ntainted by prejudice, malice or indifference. It is  the finding of the Board that the \napplicant was not unjust in this case. \nWas the breach trivial or has caused no damage or n o appreciable damage to the \napplicants and a mandatory injunction would impose substantial hardship on the \nrespondents ? \n66. The court, in the Rachel Chen case, considered the argument with regard to the \ninjury made to the appearance of the building being  trivial. Again Holland J was \nquoted: \n\u201cEven though no physical damage was done to the buil ding and the work exposed \nthe body corporate to no financial outlay or presen t liability, the defendants\u2019 action \nspurned the authority of the body corporate and the  council and disregarded the by-\nlaws by which all the proprietors are bound. It has  placed the body corporate and \nthe council in a most difficult position. If it wen t without challenge and goes without \nredress, their authority is undermined and their ha nds tied in deciding future action \nwith respect to the preservation and appearance of the building and the \nperformance of their duty to act in the common inte rest of all proprietors.\u201d  STB 21 of 2016 \u2013 Gallop Gables     Page 22 of 23 \n 67. The respondents were, from the outset, aware of  the concerns of the applicants and \nchose to complete their renovations when the necess ary approvals had yet to be \ngranted. They have  placed the body corporate and the council in a mos t difficult \nposition. If it went without challenge and goes wit hout redress, their authority is \nundermined and their hands tied in deciding future action with respect to the \npreservation and appearance of the building and the  performance of their duty to \nact in the common interest of all proprietors.  Restoring the windows and sliding \ndoors with dimensions in accordance with the drawin gs in Annex 1 of Form 9 of the \napplication (it will not be necessary that the mate rials used should be aluminum) \nwould result in inconvenience, time and a financial  outlay on the part of the \nrespondents. They have no one but themselves to bla me. \n68. It was submitted that orders for removal and re instatement should not be made \nbecause uniformity is no longer possible because al terations have been made in \nother lots. Unlike the Rachel Chen case, the Board is, in this case, not aware of any \nmatter that will prevent the applicant from commenc ing actions against other \nsubsidiary proprietors who have carried out any wor k in breach of the by-laws. \n69. Accordingly it is ordered that: \n(a) the respondents remove: \ni)  polyvinylchlo ride window casements;                                                                                      \nii)  polyvinylchloride sliding door frame with two sliding tracks;                                              \niii)  balcony sliding doors; and                                                                                               \niv)  top layer windows that are flushed with the ba lcony sliding doors.  \n(b) Following the removal of the aforementioned ite ms, the respondents must \nreinstate the items removed with:                                                     \n i-i)  powder coated window casements with dimensio ns that are set out in a \ndrawing that was annexed in Form 9 of the applicati on ;                                                           STB 21 of 2016 \u2013 Gallop Gables  Page 23 of 23 ii-i)  powder coated sliding door frames with four sliding tracks with dimensions\nthat are set out in a drawing that was annexed in Form 9 of the \n application;     \niii-i) powder coated sliding doors that are collapsible on either side with\ndimensions that are set out in a drawing that was annexed in Form 9 of\n the application; and \niv-i) top layer windows that are recessed against the sliding door with\ndimensions that are set out in a drawing that was annexed in Form 9 of the\napplication. \n(c) The respondents will pay costs fixed at S$10,000.\nDated this 17th day of March 2017 \nClerical errors corrected on 6 April 2017 MR REMEDIOS F.G \nDeputy President \nMR FRANKIE CHIA \nMember \nMR TER KIM CHEU \nMember  "

(Deputy President)  \n Prof Teo Keang Sood  (Member)  \n  Mr. Chua Koon Hoe  (Member)  \n \nCounsel :  i) Ms. Valerie Ang  \n  (Straits Law Practice LLC ) for the Applicant  \n \n ii) Ms. Teh Ee -von \n  (Infinitus Law Corporation ) for the Respondent  \n \n \n  \nGROUNDS OF DECISION  \n \n1. This is an application under s 106 of the Building Mainte nance and Strata \nManagement Act  (Cap. 30C) (\u201cthe Act \u201d) by a subsidiary proprietor for an order \nto invalidate a by-law that empowered the management corporation to remove \nthe central cooling towers that serviced the air -conditioning systems in the \nestate.   \n 2 \nSTB 80 of 2016 \u2013 Leonie Towers  \n BACKGROUND : \n \n2. Leonie Towers comprises 92 units in two tower blocks of  25-storeys each. There \nis a central air -con system in the estate and each tower is serviced by two central \ncooling towers. The central air -con system is approximately 35  years old. \nAccording to ASHRAE  Applications Handbook , the estimated service life for a \ncooling tower is 20  years , i.e. the towers in the estate have outlived the \nestimated service life.  \n \n3. PCA Consulting Engineers were engaged by the management corporation of \nthe estate \u2013 MCST Plan No. 361 (the Respondent ) to study and report on the \nsystem in Oct ober 2015 . \ni) There was corrosion of the steel piping and related components that was \ncontinuous and unstoppable  \u2013 costs for replacing them was expensive ; \nii) Water quality was poor  (cloudy)  \u2013 there was likeli hood of Legionell a \n(Legionnaire s\u2019 disease) ; and  \niii) The system was operating at below average level (because 60% of the \nresidents were using their own air -con units ). \n \n4. At an Extraordinary General Meeting on 22/09/16, the following resolution was \ntabled for consideration:  \nTo consider and if deemed fit, to pass with or without amendments the \nfollowing Additional By -Law by way of special resolution pursuant to S.32 (3) \nof the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act: That the two central \ncooling towers, and its related fix tures and fittings, be permanently removed \nafter 6 months of the date of the passing of this Additional By -Law.   \n(the Additional By -Law)  \n \n5. The general body was presented with the following information:  \n \na) estimated yearly costs for maintaining a nd repairing the cooling towers \nwas $4,624 pm , i.e. $55,488 pa;                                                                                          \nb) costs for carrying out major repairs estimated at $520,000;  \nc) costs for installing a new central air -con system, $750,000; and   \n 3 \nSTB 80 of 2016 \u2013 Leonie Towers  \n d) to remove and discontinue the system, $85,000.  \n6. 82% of the subsidiary proprietors who were at the meeting voted in favour of \nthe resolution.  \n \n7. Mdm Yap Choo Moi (the A pplicant) is a subsi diary proprietor in the estate and \nis the owner of #03 -28. She has applied for the following orders:  \ni. An order to invalidate a purported by -law to empower the MCST to \nremove the common air -con cooling towers . \nii. An orde r to defer any action to remove  the cooling towers until 6 \nmonths after the Board has made its judgment . \n \n8. She wants the Board to invalidate the Additional By -Law and in the event that \nthe by-law is not invalidated by the Board, the MCST is not  to do anything until \n6 months after the decision of the Board.  \n \n9. It is her case that she relies on the cooling towers. She alleges that they are in \ngood working order; the air -con systems in the various units depend on the \ncooling towers functioning; removal of the cooling towers will require the air-\ncon systems to be scrapped. Whilst some units (not all) have installed systems \nthat are independent of the cooling towers, removal of the cooling towers \nwould require her to install a new system which she alleges will lower the \nquality of life.  \n \n \nAPPLICANT\u2019S SUBMISSION S: \n \n10. In support of her  application, the Applicant referred to the powers and duties of \na management corporation. Under s 24(3) of the Act , a management corporation \nshall have the powers duties and functions conferred or imposed under this Act \nor by the by -laws\u2026and shall have the control, management and administration \nof the common property comprised in the strata title plan . The duties of a \nmanagement corporation are set out in s 29 of the Act. Inter alia, with regard to \ncommon p roperty , it has a duty to control , manage and administer common  \n 4 \nSTB 80 of 2016 \u2013 Leonie Towers  \n property for the benefit of all subsidiary proprietors; properly maintain and keep \ncommon property in a state of good and serviceable repair (including where \nreasonably necessary renew or repl ace the whole or part thereof).  \n       \n11. Under s 32(3) of the Act \u2026 a management corporation may, pursuant to a \nspecial resolution, make by -laws\u2026for the purpose of controlling and managing \nthe use or enjoyment of the parcel comprised in the strata title plan \u2026 including \nall or any of the purposes spelt out in s 32(3) (a) to (i).  \n \n12. It was submitted that the Additional by -law was made under s 32(3) of the Act \nand that the section only provided for the making of by -laws that performed a \nregulatory role and  that it did not allow for the making of a by -law for disposing \nof common propert y. \n                                \n                                                                    \nRESPONDENT\u2019S SUBMISSIONS:  \n \n13. It was the submission of th e Respondent that the Additional By -law was within \nthe powers of the management corporation to make and was within the ambit of \nadministering common property. It was made in accordance with s 32 of the Act \nwhere there was a power for a management corporation to restrict the use of \ncommon property and such other matters as are appropriate to the type of strata \nscheme.  \n \n14. Under s 29(1) and (2) of the Act , a management corporation has a duty to \ncontrol, manage and administer the common property for the benefit of all \nsubsidiary proprietors; install and provide additional facilities or make \nimprovements to the common property for the benefit of the subsidiary \nproprietors and the power to do all things necessary for the performance of its \nduties and for the enforc ement of the by -laws. It was submitted that the \nAdditional  by-law was congruent with the R espondent\u2019s duties under the Act . \n \n15. The Respondent could not dispute that there was no provision in the Act that \nspecifically allowed for the removal of the cooling towers (or any other common  \n 5 \nSTB 80 of 2016 \u2013 Leonie Towers  \n property). It was , however , submitted that there was no provision in the Act that \nprohibited the removal of common property.  \n \n16. With regard to s 29(1)(b) which provided that it shall be the duty of a  \nmanagement corpor ation to  \u201c\u2026 properly maintain and keep in a state of  good \nand serviceable \u2013 repair including where reasonably necessary, renew or \nreplace the whole or part thereof) th e common property ...\u201d , it was submitted \nthat the obligation to properly maintain and keep in a state of good and \nserviceable repair was not absolute and had to be balanced with what was \nreasonably necessary, i.e. there was no obligation to do so where it was not \nreasonably necessa ry. In the circumstances of this case, it was not reasonably \nnecessary to maintain the cooling towers and keep them in a state of good and \nserviceable repair . \n \n17. The case for the Respondent is that disposal/removal of an inefficient/outdated \nand expensiv e system equates to controlling and administering the common \nproperty and that the disposal/removal will improve the common property.  \n \n18. The Respondent also referred to s 23(1) of the Land Titles (Strata) Act (Cap. \n158) (LTSA) and s 34(1) of the Act and submitted that the provisions were not \napplicable to this case.  \n \n19. Before it was amended by Act s 47/2004 and 42/2005, s 23(1) of the LTSA was \nas follows:  \n23(1) The subsidiary proprietors may, by unanimous resolution passed at a \ngeneral meeting of the management corporation direct the management \ncorporation to dispose of or transfer \u2013 \n(a) any part of the common property, being a parcel of land or part thereof;  \n(b) a part of any building; or  \n(c) any immovable property affixed to the common property.  \n \n20. Section  34(1) of the Act is as follows:   \n 6 \nSTB 80 of 2016 \u2013 Leonie Towers  \n A management corporation may, subject to the approval of the relevant \nauthority, and pursuant to a 90% resolution \u2013 \n(a) execute on behalf of its subsidiary proprietors a transfer of any part of the \ncommon property (including a part  of any building or any immovable property \naffixed to the common property) as provided in S 23 of the Land Titles \n(Strata) Act (Cap. 158); or  \n(b) execute on their behalf a lease of or rent part of such common property for \na period which exceed s three years.  \nother than common property which is the subject of any lease accepted or \nacquired by the management corporation under subsection (3 ). \n \n \nBOARD\u2019S DECISION  \n \n21. The Board is of the view that the Respondent had valid concerns when the \nresolution for the Additional By -Law which enabled the respondent to \npermanently remove,  i.e. dispose of common property , was tabled. This \nconcern, however , does not by itself permit the making of the by -law. It had to \nbe determined if the R espondent had the power under the Act to make the by -\nlaw. \n \n22. A m anagement corporation is a creature of statute and its powers are \ncircumscribed by provisions in the Act. It is specifically provided in s 24 (3) of \nthe Act that:  \nA management corporation constituted in respect of a strata title plan shall have \nthe powers, duties and functions confe rred or imposed on it by or under this Act, \nor by the by laws in respect of the parcel comprised in that strata title plan and \nsubject to this Act shall have the control, management and administration of the \ncommon property comprised in the strata title pl an. \n \n23. It will be clear that a submission that a management corporation can do anything \nas long as there is no prohibition in the Act or the by -laws cannot be correct.  \n  \n 7 \nSTB 80 of 2016 \u2013 Leonie Towers  \n 24. Section  29 of the Act sets out the duties and powers of a management \ncorporation . Specifically , it is provided in s 29(1)(a), (b) and (d) that a \nmanagement corporation is required to control, manage and administer the \ncommon property for the benefit of all subsidiary proprietors; to properly \nmaintain and keep in a state of good and serviceable repair (including where \nreasonably necessary, renew or replace the whole or part thereof); and to install, \nor provide additional facilities or make improvements to the common property \nwhen directed by a special resolution.  \n \n25. With regard to m aintaining and keeping common property in a state of good and \nserviceable repair, the Board does not agree that there is a duty to do this only \nwhere it was reasonably necessary to do so. S ection  29(1)(b) is as follows:  \nExcept as otherwise provided in subs ection (3), it shall be the duty of a \nmanagement corporation  \u2013 (b) to properly maintain and keep in a state of good \nand serviceable repair (including, where reasonably necessary, renew or \nreplace the whole or part thereof)  \u2013 (i) the common property\u2026  \n \n26. The duty to maintain and keep common property in a state of good and \nserviceable repair is unconditional. There is also a duty to renew and replace \ncommon property, but this duty arises only where it is reasonably necessary to \ndo so , i.e. there is no duty t o replace or renew common property until it is \nreasonably necessary to do so.  \n \n27. By virtue of s 13(1) of the Land Titles (Strata ) Act (Cap. 158), common property \nis held by subsidiary proprietors as tenants in common in shares proportional to \ntheir respective share values. Accordingly , common property is vested in the \nsubsidiary proprietor s and not in the management corporation.  \n \n28. Chan Sek Kiong J (as he then was) in Poh Kiong Kok v MCST Plan No . 581 \n[1990 ] 1 SLR(R) 617  at [10]  explained the nature of co -ownership of common \nproperty : - \u201c\u2026 at common law  all co -proprietors have unity of possession and \nno proprietor can claim possession of a separate part of the property against his \nco-proprietor\u2026 \u201d .  \n 8 \nSTB 80 of 2016 \u2013 Leonie Towers  \n  \n29. In that case, the parking lots in the estate had been allocated on an exclusive \nand permanent basis resulting in  a subsidiary proprietor  being permanently \ndeprived of the use and enjoyment of all the parking lots save that which had \nbeen allocated to him. The plaintiff, a subsidiar y proprietor complained that he \nhad been allocated an inferior parking lot and his request to be allowed to park \nat any available lot on a first come first served basis was ignored by the \nmanagement council . He commenced an action seeking a declaration tha t a \nsubsidiary proprietor could not be excluded from the use and enjoyment of any \npart of the common property.  \n \n30. It was  the finding of the court that at common law  all co -proprietors have unity \nof possession and no proprietor can claim possession of a separate part of the \nproperty against his co -proprietor \u2026the management corporation has no power \nto prevent any proprietor from parking his car in any unoccupied parking lot by \nreserving it exclusively to some other person.  \n \n31. There can be no dispute that the cooling towers in this case are common \nproperty as they come within the definition in s 2(1) of the Act. They are held by \nthe Applicant as a tenant in common in shares proportional to her share val ues. \nThey do not belong to  the R espondent and they are necessary for the \nApplicant\u2019s use and enjoyment of her unit. The R espondent has by way of a \nspecial resolut ion made a by -law enabling the Respondent to deprive the \nApplicant of a piece of the common property by removing/disposing/discarding \nit. \n \n32. Whilst there are provisions in s 29 of the Act for controlling, managing, \nadministering common property and keeping common property in a state of \ngood and serviceable repair, there is no provision in the Act that allo ws for the \npermanent removal/disposal/discarding of common pr operty.   \n \n33. Section  33 of the Act provides for the conferring of exclusive use/privileges over \ncommon property , i.e. subsidiary proprietors can be deprived of the use of \ncommon property when ex clusive use and enjoyment of such has been  \n 9 \nSTB 80 of 2016 \u2013 Leonie Towers  \n conferred on another subsidiary proprietor in accordance with s 33. Accordingly , \nit can be noted that there is a provision in the Act that provides that subsidiary \nproprietors can be deprived of the use of common property. The section , \nhowever , does not provide for the removal/discarding of common property.  \n \n34. Section  34 of the Act permits a management corporation, subject to approval of \na relevant authority and pursuant to a 90% resolution to execute a transfer of \ncommon property or lease or rent out common property for more than 3 years ; \nfor a lease of between 1 an d 3 years by spec ial resolution; and  for a lease of \nless than 1 year , a management corporation can do this w ithout need for any \nresolution.  \n35. It will be in order to note that s 34 is concerned with transfer of common property \nand leasing of common property. It is not co ncerned with disposal/discarding of \ncommon property other than by transfer and lease. The requirement of the \nrequisite resolution ensures that any subsidiary proprietor whose rights to use \nand enjoyment of common property is affected by a transfer or lease  will be \nnotified and given an opportunity to discuss with other subsidiary proprietors.  \n \n36. When common property has been transferred or leased out , subsidiary \nproprietors will be deprived of the use and enjoyment of the property and it is \nnoteworthy tha t a 90% resolution is required for common property to be \ntransferred or leased out for more than three years. In this case , the Respondent \nis seeking to permanently dep rive the A pplicant of the use and enjoyment of \ncommon property by way of a special resol ution.  \n \n37. The then s 23 (1) of the LTSA (Cap. 158) (see above) did provide for the disposal \nof common property. The section was deleted and substituted by the Building \nMaintenance and Strata Act 2004 (No . 47 of 2004 and Statutes (Miscellaneous \nAmendments) (No . 2) Act 2005 (No . 42 of 2005). There is currently no provision \nin the Act or the LTSA that allows for a management corporation to dispose of \ncommon property. It is noteworthy that even when this could  be done, it could \nonly be done by way of a unanimous resolution .  \n  \n 10 \nSTB 80 of 2016 \u2013 Leonie Towers  \n 38. It is the finding of this Board that the management corporation did not have the \npower to make the Additional By -law in this case. It is hereby declared that it is \ninvalid.  \n \n \n \nDated this 3rd day of March 2017 . \n \n \n \n \n         \n        MR REMEDIOS FRANCIS G.  \n        Deputy President  \n \n \n \n         \n        PROF TEO KEANG SOOD  \n        Member  \n \n \n \n                \n        MR CHUA KOON HOE  \n        Member  "

Respondents \nGROUNDS OF DECISION  \n1. The Applicant\u2019s claim against the 1st Respondent is that he be ordered to repair the\nwaterproofing to his unit so as to prevent leaks to the Applicant\u2019s unit. As against the 2nd\nRespondent who are the Management Corporation Strata Plan No. 2341 (\u201cMCST\u201d), the\nApplicant seek s an order that they repair the corroded steel reinforcement that has affected\nthe structural integrity  of the slab between the Applicant\u2019s unit and the 1st Respondent\u2019s\nunit. STB 64 OF 2016 \u2013 PARC VISTA CONDO  2 2. Parc Vista is about 20 years old having obtained its TOP in 1997.  The Applicant bought\nUnit XXX sometime in 2016.  He found extensive cracks in the ceiling of his master  \nbedroom,  sitting  room  and sitting  room  common  toilet.   Cracks  were  also  found  on the \nvertical walls  behind  building  fa\u00e7ade  in his sitting room and  master bedroom.  There were \nalso signs  of water  seepage  at the ceiling  level  and the external  wall.  These  defects  are \nevident  in the many  photographs  which  he included  in his submission.   He had reported  \nthe defects to the condominium management office since early April 2016.\n3. The Applicant suspected that the cracks were due to water seepage from the outdoor\nbalcony flooring of the 1st Respondent\u2019s Unit XXX which sits above his unit.  He was in \ndirect contact with the 1st Respondent on the matter from 2 July 2016.  The 1st Respondent \nconfirmed  at the  hearing  on 24 February  2017 that  he accepts  responsibility  for any water  \nseepage  from  his unit into the Applicant \u2019s unit.  He will arrange  for any defect  in the \nwaterproofing in his unit to be rectified and that should stop further water seepage from his  \nunit into the Applicant \u2019s unit belo w.\n4. In late July 2016, the Applicant started renovation work in preparation for moving in.\nBetween 20 and 22 July 2016, his contractor hacked away the loose concrete from the\ncracked areas and discovered that the steel reinforcement embedded within the slabs were\nseverely corroded.  The Applicant was concerned about the structural integrity of  the slabs\nand brought the matter to the attention of the condominium manager.  However, he was\ntold to get his own Professional Engineer (\u201cPE\u201d) to investigate because in the view of the\ncondominium manager defects in slabs were for the owners themselves t o resolve.  The\nApplicant then engaged a PE from YMW Consultants who inspected the premises on 6\nAugust 2016 and submitted an inspection report dated 10 August 2016 which is annexed at\nTab C of his bundle of documents. STB 64 OF 2016 \u2013 PARC VISTA CONDO  3 5. The PE, Er. Wong Yew Fai, noted sp alling of concrete in large areas of the ceiling of the\nliving room, master bedroom and common toilet.  He observed that the concrete cover had\ndelaminated and the reinforcement bars were badly corroded and had lost over 40% of\ntheir cross -sectional area.  In his view, the corrosion was due to electro -chemical reaction\nwith water and oxygen and his thermal scanning showed slightly lower temperature at the\nspalled area compared to non -spalled area which he interpreted as due to the presence of\nmoisture in th e concrete.  He concluded that the reinforcement bars were no longer\nserviceable and needed to be rectified/replaced immediately and the spalled area restored\nby concrete jacketing method.\n6. Separately, the 2nd Respondent also engaged a PE, Er. Liu Xiao  Peng, from Leo Building\nSolutions to investigate and recommend remedial measures.  Er. Liu visited the site on 5\nNovember 2016 and his report dated 13 November 2016 is exhibited at Tab G of the\nApplicant\u2019s bundle of documents.\n7. Er. Liu noted that \u201cthe reinforced concrete in the roof slab and beams in Unit XXX, Tower \n3, Parc Vista condominium is suffering from durability problems arising from the \ncorrosion of reinforcement .\u201d  The corroded reinforcement was visible as the owner had \nremoved the cracked and spalling concrete cover.  He observed corroded reinforcement in the \nliving room, a bedroom and the toilet.  In his view, \u201cthese reinforcement corrosions have led to \nvarious forms of corrosion-induced damage such as concrete cracking and spalling, and to \nreduction in structural capacity.  It is observed that the corrosion is more than 40% of the \nreinforcement cross area and the exposed concrete showed a high humidity.\u201d  He also noted \nthat the open roof terrace of Unit XXX is above the affected  bedroom of Unit XXX.  He did \nnot see water leaking \u201cin the living room with roof STB 64 OF 2016 \u2013 PARC VISTA CONDO  4 terrace\u201d but observed old water stains at other areas.  In his view, the inherent alkalinity of \nPortland Cement concrete which protects the reinforcement steel from corrosion had been \nneutralized slowly and progressively over time by atmospheric carbon dioxide penetrating \nand chemically reacting with the concrete in a process called carbonation, and this process \nis accelerated where there is high humidity.  Once the carbonation reaches t he steel layer, \nthe steel becomes vulnerable to corrosion and the dire results of badly corroded steel are \nseen in the photographs he included in his report.  \n8. Er. Liu summarised his conclusion as follows: \u201cConsidering the time of 20 years since \nParc Vista condominium was built and the unfavourable location of Unit XXX, Tower 3, \ncarbonation due to high humidity of concrete is the leading factor for the reinforcement  \ncorrosion\u201d.  He recommended immediate repairs to safeguard the structure\u2019s integrity, \nincluding propping up the beams and slabs prior to the start of the repair work for safety  \nreason. The need to erect support structures underscore the severity of the structural  \ndefects.\n9. For the hearing on 24 February 2017, the MCST brought in a third PE, Er. Ng Soon Hua,  \nas expert witness.  Er. Ng Soon Hua said that he had reviewed the reports of the other two \nPEs but he himself had not visited the site.  He was in general agreement with the findings \nand conclusions in the reports but stressed that any structural repairs to be undertaken must \nbe under the direction and supervision of a PE.  He highlighted that the hacking away of  \nthe loose and spalled concrete was apparently done by contractors without a professional \nengineer \u2019s supervision and that should not have been so.  He opined that after the cracked  \nand spalled concrete were removed, the reinforcement will corrode even more as some \nprotection is better than no protection.  However, he did not say that the hacking was \nexcessive or had added to the pre-existing structural damage. STB 64 OF 2016 \u2013 PARC VISTA CONDO  5 10. The Board notes that both the first and second PE engaged by the MCST had found that\nthe steel reinforcement had lost over 40% of its cross -sectional area through corrosion and\nhad already impaired the structural integrity  of the  slabs and needed immediate structural\nrepair.  The dire condition was pre -existing and it became apparent upon removal of the\ncracked and spalled concrete. It was not the result of the hacking.  Er. Wong who inspected\nthe Unit just 2 weeks after the hacki ng stated that \u201cThe condition of the rebars is\nunserviceable\u201d.  The contemporaneous photographs clearly recorded the condition and Er.\nLiu who inspected the Unit 3 months later also did not suggest that the condition was due\nto or made worse by the hacking  away of the loose and spalled concrete.  The Board finds\nno evidence that the Applicant who is a new owner and was only doing renovation in\npreparation of moving in, had in any way contributed to the structural damage to the\nceilings and walls of his new apartment.  The Board finds that the MCST\u2019s claim that the\nproblem has become aggravated after removal of the \u201cspalling concrete\u201d  is without\nsupporting evidence.  Indeed, the Board is concerned that the MCST which had been kept\ninformed all along through i ts condominium manager (s) of the serious corrosion had\napparently not initiated any action to repair the defective structural beams and slabs even\nthough the Applicant\u2019s appointed PE and the MCST\u2019s appointed PE both recommended\nimmediate repairs for struct ural safety reason.\n11. The Board finds from the evidence that the slabs and the embedded steel reinforcement\nbetween the Applicant and the 1st Respondent\u2019s unit are common property, and is so badly\ndamaged through no fault of any party. Under Section 29(1)(b )(i) of the Building\nMaintenance and Strata Management Act (\u201cBMSMA), the management corporation is duty\nbound to repair, renew or replace as necessary any part of the common property that is not\nin a good and serviceable state.  The 2nd Respondent\u2019s conten tion that the Applicant and STB 64 OF 2016 \u2013 PARC VISTA CONDO  6 the 1st Respondent should bear equally the costs of the repair to the damaged structural \ncapacity of the slab is without merit. Since it is a common property, the costs of repair \nshould be borne by the MCST.  \n12. The Board  make s the following orders:\n1. The 1st Respondent shall engage a qualified contractor to carry out such waterproofing\nof his open deck and common toilet as recommended by a qualified contractor within\n8 weeks; and\n2. The 2nd Respondent is to engage a Professional Engineer registered in Civil\nEngineering to examine and make recommendations to rectify the structural defects\nand corrosion of the steel reinforcement and make such repairs as recommended under\nthe direction and supervision of the Professional Engineer wi thin 8 weeks.\n13. The Board also orders that both the respondents shall consult their respective\ncontractors/consultants to co -ordinate their works. STB 64 OF 2016 \u2013 PARC VISTA CONDO  7 14. The Board will hear parties on costs.\nDated this 2nd day of March 2017  \nMR ALFONSO ANG  \nPresident  \nMS LEE LAY SEE  \nMember  \nMR CHUA KOON HOE  \nMember  "

The Applicants, Cheong Wan Kong and Cheong Yuet Leng, are the subsidiary proprietors \nof unit #XXX  of Eunos Mansion (the \u201cDevelopment\u201d).\n2. The Respondents, Lim Sze Eng and Tan Lay Hoon, are the subsidiary proprietors of unit \n#XXX. They own a total of seven units in the same Development.

Zhang Li Xia (\u201cZLX\u201d), the Applicants\u2019 tenant, reported to the 1st Applicant\u2019s (\u201cCWK\u201d)\nwife, Tan Siew Chin (\u201cTSC\u201d), that there were serious leakages in the master bedroom\ntoilet in early 2015.STB 89 of 2015 \u2013 Eunos Mansion  Page 2 of 3 4. A workman, sent by the 1st Respondent, Lim Sze Eng (\u201cLSE\u201d) went to repair the leaks but \nthe leaks did not stop and spread to the ceilings of the master bedroom itself and the \nkitchen. To-date, the leaks are still present although there were several attempts made to \nrepair them.\n5. TSC said she informed LSE, about the leaks in early 2015 when their tenant, ZLX, reported \nthem.\n6. Several attempts were made by LSE to repair the leakages but were not successful.\n7. Applicants appointed an expert, Bruce James Loggie (\u201cBJL\u201d), in June 2016 to investigate \nthe cause of the leaks.\n8. BJL presented two reports which specifically concluded that:-\na)the sanitary waste pipes serving the Unit #XXX are not water tight but have failed and \ncaused water seepage to the below Unit #XXX  Master Bedroom Bathroom; and\nb)the waterproofing system to Unit #XXX  Master Bathroom has failed and as such, full \nre-waterproofing works are now required to be carried out to the Unit #XXX Master \nBathroom throughout to arrest the current water seepage problem.\n9. BJL testified that if there were cracked or broken pipes concealed in the bathroom wall, as \nalleged by the Respondents, they could, at best, contribute to the water leakages and not the \nsole cause of the leakages.\nThe Respondents\u2019 Case \n10. LSE said that he was only notified of the leakages in June 2015 and he had promptly\narranged for repairs to be done to arrest the problem in both his unit and the Applicants\u2019\nunit\n11. LSE said that although he had agreed to complete the repairs as recommended by BJL, he\ndisagreed with his findings as his own contractor reported to him that there was nothing\nwrong with the sanitary pipes and therefore he could not carry out any repairs to non-\nexistent defects. He also disagreed with BJL\u2019s report that the water proofing in his master\nbedroom toilet had failed.\n12. He suggested that the leakages could have come from broken or cracked concealed pipes\nbehind the master bathroom wall and these are common discharge pipes which are within\nthe MCST\u2019s purview. He produced a report from IGM Construction (S) Pte Ltd (\u201cIGM\u201d).\nThe Board\u2019s Findings \n13. The Board considered the IGM \u201cService Report\u201d produced by the Respondents and BJL\u2019s\nreports produced by the Applicants.\n14. The IGM \u201cService Report\u201d in one sentence, declared as follows:-\n\u201cFinding: Existing Stack Column At Master Bedroom Toilet Detected Concealed \nDischarge Pipe Breakage Or Cracked Causing Severe Water Ingress To \nVoid Section Of Stack Column At #XXX  Master Bedroom Toilet Thus  STB 89 of 2015 \u2013 Eunos Mansion  Page 3 of 3 Causing Water Ponding Within Stack Column And Resulted In Water \nSeepage To Part Of External Wall And Below Unit #XXX \u201d \n15. The Board noted that the pipes were concealed and there was no explanation as to how\nIGM came to the conclusion that there were broken or cracked pipes within. No one from\nIGM was called to give evidence to substantiate the findings.\n16. Even if there were \u201ccracked or broken pipes\u201d, the water ponding, resulting from that, was\nwithin the premises of the Respondents and allowed to seep through the failed water\nproofing of the bathroom floor. The water behind the wall could also have seeped through\nthe tiles on the floor or the wall as there was a shower located nearby.\n17. The Board, therefore, does not accept IGM\u2019s report and accepts the 2 reports of building\nsurveyor, BJL.\n18. The Board finds that water leaked from the premises of the Respondents\u2019 unit into the\nApplicants\u2019 unit through the failed water proofing system in the Respondents\u2019 master\nbedroom toilet and the sanitary pipes serving the Respondents\u2019 unit. The Respondents are\ntherefore responsible for the leakages.\n19. The Board orders that the Respondents shall, within 2 weeks from the date of this order,\ncarry out the rectifications and repairs as recommended by BJL in his 2 reports of July\n2016 and September 2016.\n20. The Board will hear parties on costs and damages.\nDated this 28th day of November 2016 \nMR SENG KWANG BOON \nDeputy President \nMR EDWIN CHOO \nMember \nMR GOH TIAM LOCK \nMember  "

The eight A pplicants are subsidiary proprietors of a total of 22 units in the \ndevelopment known as Alpha Industrial Building.   The Temporary Occupation \nPermit was  issued  on 30 November 2004.  \n \n2. The Respondent, MCST Plan No. 3293, is the Management Corporation of \nthe said development , and formed on 18 November 2010 . \n \n3. At the 1st Annual General Meeting (the \u201c1st AGM\u201d) of the Management \nCorporation held on 29 July 2011,  resolution s were passed for the Additional \nby-law 10 (\u201cUse of Common Property By -Law\u201d) and the Additional By-Law 8  \n(\u201cUse of Common Area for purpose of running a canteen By -Law\u201d) . \n \n4. Additional By-Law 10 provide s as follows:  \n\u201cAny usage of common areas for placing or dumping of items/rubbish along \nthe frontage that exceeds its length of 1.2m or 4ft will be charged the entire \nusage area at a minimum charge of $200.00 per month.  \nWaste Material shall be removed at co st and cleared at weekends by the \nManagement  Corporation.  \nExplanation: Use of Common area for placing items $200.00 per month \u201d \n \n5. Additional By-Law 8 provides as follows:  \n\u201cUsage of common areas for purpose of running a canteen will be pegged at \nthe current rental agreement pro -rated based on floor area at $3.50 cents per \nsq ft and after the current rental agreement expires, the canteen operator 3 \n \n3 \n STB 32 of 2016 (Alpha Industrial Building)  shall pay the Management Corpo ration the rental of the common area outside \nof their actual canteen ownership floor area at a rate of $3.50 cents of \ncommon area per sq ft for the use of this common area.  \nExplanation: Use of Common Area for running a canteen is $3.50 cents per \nsq ft\u201d \n \n6. Inexplicably, the two Additional By-Laws were passed , both under : \n(a) Paragraph 6.0 of agenda to the Notice of AGM (titled \u2018TO PASS A \nSPECIAL RESOLUTION ON THE BY -LAWS OF THE MANAGEMENT \nCORPORATION\u2019) ; and   \n(b) Paragraph 7.0 of the agenda (titled \u2018EXCLUSIVE USE OF THE \nCOMMON AREAS BY -LAWS\u2019).  \nIn addition, both Additional By-Laws were also duly lodged with the Building \nand Construction Authority.  \n \nTHE APPLICANTS\u2019 CASE  \n7. The Applicants\u2019 case is that the Additional By-Laws were not properly made \nfor the following reasons:  \n(a) They were passed only as ordinary resolutions , when they can only be \npassed as special resolution s, as those  by-laws were made under \nSection 33 of the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act, \nChapter 30C (\u201cBMSMA\u201d) which is for exclusive use by -laws.  \n \nTo support this, the Applica nts cited paragraph 7.0 of the Notice and \nAgenda for the 1st AGM which reads as follows:  4 \n \n4 \n STB 32 of 2016 (Alpha Industrial Building)  \u201c 7.0 Exclusive Use of the Common Areas By -Laws  \n \nThe Management Corporation hereby by ordinary resolution pass a \nresolution on the exclusive use of common property for a subsidiary \nproprietor, tenant or occupier of a lot to use for a period of 1 year part \nof the common property in receipt of payment of money for the \nfollowing purposes:  \n \u2026.. \n 7.3 (additional by -law 10)  \n 7.4 (additional by -law 8)\u201d  \n \n(b) These two Additional By-Laws effectively impose \ncharges/penalties/fines on the subsidiary proprietors which the \nManagement Corporation has no power to do so.  \n \n(c) Under Section 33 of the BMSMA, the written consent of the subsidiary \nproprietor of the lot concerned needs to be obtained.  There were no \nwritten consents given by any of the Applicants. To support this \ncontention, they referred to para graphs 7.0, 7.3 and 7.4 of the Notice \nand A genda of the 1st AGM:  \n7.0 \u201cExclusive Use of the Common Areas By -Laws \u201d \n7.3 \u201cUse of Common Property for placing items on Frontage of lots \u201d \n7.4 \u201cUse of Common Property for the purpose of running a canteen \u201d \nThe Applicants further submitted that the phrasings of the two by -laws \nare consistent with \u201cexclusive use by -laws\u201d. 5 \n \n5 \n STB 32 of 2016 (Alpha Industrial Building)   \n(d) The two Additional By-Laws are unclear and vague and hence they are \nnot made in the interest of subsidiary proprietors , as they cause \nconfusion and are difficult to adhere to.  \n \nTHE RESPONDENT\u2019S CASE  \n8. The Respondent\u2019s case is that the two Additional B y-Laws were passed \nvalidly at a duly convened AGM for the following reasons:  \n(a) They were passed by a special resolution and under Section 32 of the \nBMSMA for the purpose of controlling and managing the use or \nenjoyment of the parcel comprised in the strata title plan:  \n(i) 21 days  notice was gi ven as required.  \n(ii) Paragraph 6.0 of the Notice and Agenda of the 1st AGM stated \nas follows: \u201cTo pass a Special Resolution on the By -laws of the \nManagement Corporation\u201d  \n(iii) In the Appendix II of the Notice, the two by -laws were enclosed.  \n(iv) The ballot on a poll was 49,623 share values for the resolution \nand none against it.  \n \n(b) They were made under Section 32 and not under Section 33 of the \nBMSMA and therefore no consent of the subsidiary proprietor \nconcerned was needed.  \n \nAGREED FACTS  \n9. The parties have prepared an Agreed  Statement of Facts (AF1).  6 \n \n6 \n STB 32 of 2016 (Alpha Industrial Building)   \n10. A summary of the invoices issued by the Respondent was also agreed and \nadmitted as AF2.  \n \nAGREED DOCUMENTS  \n11. The parties have also agreed (as to the authenticity but not the interpretation \nof the content) on the following documents : \n(a) Notice of 1st AGM  \n(b) Minute of 1st AGM  \n(c) Invoices rendered by Respondent  \n \nTHE BOARD\u2019S FINDING  \n12. The Board noted that the Applicants and the Respondent had agreed that only \nthe Agreed Facts and the Agreed Documents were needed  to determine the \nissue of the validity of the 2 By -Laws , and there was no need to adduce \nfurther evidence from their witnesses , unless the Board required them \nsubsequently. After reviewing the Agreed  Facts and the Agreed Documents, \nthe Board finds that they were sufficient for the Board to come to a decision \non the application  and on the validity of the 2 Additional By -Laws. .  \n \n13. The Board also noted that the Applicants did not  wish to  pursue the issue \nconcerning the  lack of 21 days \u2019 notice , and agreed  that the said resolution s \nwere passed with 100% for , and none against , the resolution s. \n \n14. Except for the use of the words \u201c ordinary resolution \u201d used in paragraph 7.0 of \nthe Notice and Agenda of the 1st AGM, there was nothing else to suggest that 7 \n \n7 \n STB 32 of 2016 (Alpha Industrial Building)  the resolution s were passed by an ordinary resolution. In fact, there were \nother paragraphs in the Notice and Agenda of the 1st AGM to suggest \notherwise. On the first page of the Notice, it was stated \u201c\u2026 to pass a \u201cSpecial \nResolution \u201d giving 21 days \u2019 notice for the By -laws of the Management \nCorporation No. 3293\u2026\u201d  \n \n15. The Board finds that sufficient notice had been given to the subsidiary \nproprietors that the two Additional By-Laws were to be passed by a special \nresolution at the 1st AGM and they were indeed passed by a spec ial resolution \nunder paragraph 6.0 of the meeting agenda , and  the procedural requirements \nwere met.  \n \n16. It is not disputed that under Section 33 of the BMSMA  for exclusive use by -\nlaws, written consents of the subsidiary proprietors  of the lot  concerned are \nnecessary , and there were none given by the Applicants. This will invalidate \nthe two Additional By-Laws if they were only made under the said section  33.  \n \n17. However, t he Board finds that on the Agreed Facts and Documents, the two \nAdditional By-Laws were pas sed both under paragraphs 6.0 and 7.0 of the \nmeeting agenda. Therefore, while they may fail under section 33 of the \nBMSMA as exclusive use by -laws (contemplated by paragraph 7.0 of the \nmeeting agenda), they were  equally  capable of being passed without any \nwritten consent under Section 32 of the BMSMA , for the purpose of controlling \nand monitoring the use or enjoyment of the parcel comprised in the strata \nplan, including such other matters as appropriate to the type of strata scheme \nconcer ned (under paragraph 6.0 of the meeting agenda) .  \n 8 \n \n8 \n STB 32 of 2016 (Alpha Industrial Building)  18. The next point to consider is that  as the two Additional By-Laws were properly \nmade by way of a special resolution and under Section 32 of the BMSMA \nwhere no consents are required, can they still be invalidated because they are \nunclear, vague and are effectively imposing a penalty on the subsidiary \nproprietors?  \n \nADDITIONAL BY -LAW 8  \n19. With respect to Additional By-Law 8, the Board is of the view that it is clear \nand unambiguous , and there is no reason why it should be invalid or repealed.    \n \n20. The Board finds that the Additional By-Law 8 is valid and enforceable.  \n \nADDITIONAL BY -LAW 10  \n \n21. With regards to Additional By-Law 10, the  Board finds that it is unclear , badly \ndrafted , as well as punitive.    \n \n22. The invoices rendered by the Respondent pursuant to Additional By -Law 10 \nstate that the fees charged were for \u201c violation \u201d.  The Respondent submitted \nthat e ven if the \u201c violation \u201d was for half an hour, the full charge  of $2 00 would \nbe imposed.  \n \n23. Further, it is unclear for Additional By -Law 10 whether the charges is for a \none-time use of the common property, or on a monthly basis.  The \nRespondent has submitted that it is on a \u201c per use \u201d basis.  \n 9 \n \n9 \n STB 32 of 2016 (Alpha Industrial Building)  24. The Additional By -Law 10  is also unclear b ecause, as pointed out by the \nApplicants \u2013 is the usable space a rectangle of 1.2m/4ft wide and the entire \nlength of the unit frontage or some other area , or in fact as submitted by the \nRespondent, there is no free usable space at all. Any space s used in front of \nthe Applicants\u2019 units are chargeable.   Further, if more than 1.2 m were used, \nwould the fees be $400?  This is not clear under  the Additional By -Law 10 , \nand prejudicial to the subsidiary proprietors who \u201c violated \u201d this Additional By -\nLaw 10. \n \n25. In addition, and more importantly so, Additional By-Law 10 provides for a \nminimum  charge but no maximum charge.  It is therefore discretionary and \nthe Management Corporation can in theory charge whatever amount they \nwanted. The Additional By-Law 10 can  therefore be capable of being \ninterpreted as a penalty provision.  \n \n26. The Board is therefore of the view that , as the Additional By-Law 10 is unclear \nin its wordings and capable of being misinterpreted  and abused , it is not made \nin the interest of all subsid iary proprietors in the use and enjoyment of their \nlots or the common property.  \n \n27.

Applicants are the subs idiary proprietors (\"SPs\") of unit #XXX in Hillington Green \n(\"the Development\") located at No. 53 Hillview Aven ue Singapore.\n2. Co-app licant, Ng Kin Hong (\"NKH\") testified that he has been living in unit #XXX  \nsince 2002 and had not encountered any water seepage problem in his unit\nSTB 26 of 2016- Hillington Green Page 1 of 3 before. Sometime between November  2014 and March 2015, NKH notice d that \nthe Respondents' unit, #XXX, which is directly above his unit, was carrying out \nsome renov ation works. \n3. In April 2015, NKH realised that there were leaks in his master toilet's ceiling and\ninformed the Respondents and MCST accordingly.\n4. NKH mentioned that the Respondents conducted a water ponding test in their\ntoilet using a red dye and during the test, water seeped through the concrete slab.\nNKH claimed that the water that seeped out was pink in color. Thereafter NKH\nsaid that the Respondents' contractor carried out numerous patch-work repairs to\nhis toilet ceiling's slab, but these repairs were not effective and the leakages\npersisted.\n5. NKH said that a chemical infusion was done to the Respondents' toilet floor and\nthis was also not effective. When a subsequent ponding test was done with blue\ndye, water still seeped through the concrete slab.\n6. NKH said that finally, sometime in September 2016, Respondents carried out a PU\npressure grouting to his toilet's slab and this has effectively solved the seepage\nproblem. There was no more water seepage into NKH's unit.\n7. NKH provided photographs, whatsapp messages and various correspondences\namong themselves and the contractors, to support his case.\nRespondents' Case \n8. Respondents are the SPs of unit #XXX  in the Development located at No. 53 \nHillview Avenue Singapore. Their unit is directly above the Applicants'.\n9. Respondents said that when they were first notified of the leakages in June 2015, \nthey had immediately taken steps to determ ine the cause of the leakages.\n10. Respon dents conducted ponding tests and pipe pressure test as well as instructing \ntheir contractors to carry out repairs in the Applicants' unit, in good faith,  to resolve \nthe issues.\n11. Respondents engaged an expert, Poh Cher Seng  (\"PCS\"), a professional engineer \nfrom Grace Consultants, who submitted 2 reports. Respondents claimed that they \nhave adequately rebutted the presumption under s101 (8) of the Building \nMaintenance and Strata Management Act (\"BMSMA\") and that the leakages did not \nemanate from their unit, they asked that the application be dismissed  with costs.\nBoard's Findings \n12. The Board noted that PCS, in his reports and his oral evidence, did not conclude\nthat the water did not emanate from the Respondents' unit. PCS simply said that\n\"it is very difficult to identify and pin point the source of water seepage ... \"\n13. PCS went on to conclude that the shower area and the water pipes were unlikely\nsources of the leakages. He suggested another possible source could be water\nSTB 26 of 2016- Hillington Green Page 2 of3 "

Respondent \nCoram: Mr. Alfonso Ang (President)  \nMr. Tan Ee Ping (Member) \nMr. Chng Beng Guan (Member) \nApplicant:  The MCST Plan No. 2412 (in person) \nRespondent:  Jonathan Surya (in person) In the matter of an application under Section \n101 of the Building Maintenance and Strata \nManagement Act in respect of the development \nknown as Simsville (MCST Plan No. 2412)  2 STB 12 OF 2016 - SIMSVILLE  GROUNDS OF DECISION \n1. The Applicant , MCST Plan No. 2412,  is the management corporation of the\nstrata title development known as Simsville. The Respondent, Jonathan Surya, \nis the subsidiary proprietor of 10 Geylang East Ave 2, #XXX of Simsville (the \n\u201cRespondent\u2019s  Unit\u201d). The  Applicant  sought  orders  under  Section  101  of the \nBuilding  Maintenance  and Strata  Management  Act, Chapter  30C (\u201cBMSMA\u201d) \nagainst the Respondent.\nBACKGROUND  \n2. This is a matter concerning water seepage which occurred on the ceiling  \noutside of the main entrance door of #XXX (the \u201cAffected Area\u201d). It should be \nnoted at the outset that the seepage did not occur in unit #X XX but was \nsituated outside of unit #XXX, which is a common property. The subsidiary  \nproprietor of #XXX was not a party in the proceedings.\n3. In view of the seepage, the Applicant engaged Building Appraisal Pte Ltd, a \nchartered building surveyor, to carry out site inspection concerning water \nseepage occurring at the Affected Area.  Inspection was carried out on 3 \nDecember 2015, and a report titled \u201cReport on Inter-floor Water Seepage  \nbetween #XXX  and #XXX  Simsville\u201d (\u201cExpert Report\u201d) was subsequently  \nprepared by Building Appraisal Pte Ltd. The Expert Report\u2019s findings were as \nfollows:\n\u201c i) Following our site inspection of #XXX & #XXX , we are of the view that \nthere is an interflow water seepage problem originating from \nthe bathroom/toilet in the utility room of #XXX; \nii)The water supply pipes should also be tested by a licensed plumber to \ncheck for its water tightness by a water pressure test;\niii)In order to confirm our findings as regards the areas of suspect that are \nleaking from #XXX, we recommend that a water ponding test be \ncarried out at the confirmed areas of failure of the waterproofing in the \nutility toilet/bathroom.  \u201d3 STB 12 OF 2016 - SIMSVILLE  4. On 11  March 2016, the Applicant filed an application  and sought  the following\norders  against the Respondent :\n\u201c i) To engage a licensed plumber, take necessary remedial action and \nrectification works for interfloor water seepage, and to submit us a report \nafterwards;  \nii)To make good the damaged ceiling due to water seepage;\niii)To reimburse the Management Corporation for the cost in engaging a\nchartered building surveyor for inspection of the water seepage; and\niv)To reimburse the Management Corporation for the cost of this\napplication.  \u201d\n5. The parties attended a total of three mediation sessions  before the Board  on 29\nApril, 17 May and 20 June 2016 . At the end of the third mediation on 20 June\n2016, parties were still unable to settle the matter as the Applicant maintained\nthat the leakage  occurring at the Affected Area  remained unresolved . Pursuant\nto section 92(1)(b) of the BMSM A, the Board  then gave directions for a n\narbitrati on hearing to be fixed on 12 July 2016 .\n6. At the scheduled hearing on 12 July 2016, parties\u2019  document s were not in order\nand their expert witnesses were unavailable . Consequently, the Board\nadjourned the hearing for parties to organise their hearing document s and\narrange for their witnesse s to attend the next hearing .\n7. At the resumed  hearing , the Respondent informed  the Board  that, in an attempt\nto resolve the leakage,  he had taken measures to bypass a concealed pipe\nwithin his own internal property and had installed external piping . However, the\nApplicant noted  that the leak in the Affected Area was still present as at the\ndate of hearing .\n8. The Applicant\u2019s expert , Mr Chin Cheong (\u201cApplicant\u2019s Expert\u201d), the chartered\nbuilding surveyor responsible for preparing the Expert Report  testified. He\nindicated that despite the measures taken by the Respondent to resolve the4 STB 12 OF 2016 - SIMSVILLE  leakage, he could not confirm the cause of the leak at the Affected Area as his \nrecommendations set out in the Expert Report were not carried out.  As a result , \nthe Board directed  parties  to jointly  conduct a conclusive test  with an \nindependent surveyor . Leave was give n to parties to prepare  a survey report  \nstating  the cause of leak and any necessary rectification works .  \n9. By the time the case was scheduled for a re-hearing on 19 September 2016,\nthe Board was informed by parties (Applicant\u2019s email dated 15 September\n2016)  that the leakage problem was resolved as the leak had ceased sometime\nin August 2016. Parties agreed that further investigation was not necessary .\n10. Parties were not able to resolve their dispute in connection with damages and\ncosts, thus hearing proceeded to hear these issues.\nBOARD\u2019S DECISION ON DAMAGES AND COSTS \n11. The Applicant sought costs for the following:\n\u201c i) Cost of engaging a Chartered Building Surveyor for inspection and \npreparation of the Report;  \nii)Cost of engaging the Surveyor to advise and attend mediation on behalf  \nof the MCST;\niii)Cost of application of the Order paid to the Strata Title Board;\niv)Damages to false ceiling above #XXX and common corridor; and\nv)Damages to the floor at #XXX  and common corridor.  \u201d\n12. The Applicant alleged that, with all other factors being equal, the water seepage\nat the Affected Area can be reasonably attributed to the Respondent\u2019s Unit as\nthe water seepage problem ceased after the Respondent repaired his pipes.\n13. The Respondent disputed the Applicant\u2019s claim, on the basis that there was a\ndearth of evidence on the Applicant\u2019s part to support such inferences .5 STB 12 OF 2016 - SIMSVILLE  Additionally, the Respondent questioned the Applicant\u2019s unsubstantiated \nconclusion that the source of leak at the Affected Area originated from his unit. \n14. The Board considered the arguments of both parties and the expert\u2019s\nsubmissions. Accordingly, the Board is of the view that the Applicant is not\nentitled to damages and costs.\n15. The Board provides hereto the grounds of their decision.\nA. Presumption in section 101(8) of the BMSMA cannot be applied\n16. Typical cases concerning inter-floor leakage involves water leakage that \nemanates from the unit directly above, causing damage to the unit below. In \nsuch cases, the presumption in section 101(8) of the BMSMA will operate in \npresuming that the apartment above is responsible for such a leak.\n17. In the present case, parties did not dispute the location of the water seepage.  \nBoth parties accepted that the water seepage wa s located on the ceiling  \noutside of the main entrance door of #XXX. If section 101(8) of the BMSMA is \napplicable, then the area outside of the main door of #XXX is presumed to be \nresponsible for the water seepage at the Affected Area.\n18. However, the Board is of the view that on a proper construction of section \n101(8) of the BMSMA, the presumption does not apply. The water seepage at \nthe Affected Area was situated outside of unit #XXX , which is considered  \n\u201ccommon property\u201d as defined in section 2(1) of the BMSMA. As the \nRespondent\u2019s Unit is not situated directly above the common property, no \npresumption applies.\n19. In order to demonstrate that the Respondent was liable for the damage done to \nthe false ceiling and floor of the Affected Area, the onus of proof lies with the \nApplicant who must prove on the balance of probabilities, that the water \nseepage at the Affected Area was reasonably attributed to the Respondent \u2019s \nUnit. Unless the Applicant is able to adduce sufficient evidence to support their \ncontention,  the Respondent would not be liable for the damage caused.6 STB 12 OF 2016 - SIMSVILLE  B. Inconclusiveness of the expert evidence\n20. The Board finds that the Applicant\u2019s Expert was unable to ascertain the cause\nof the leak at the Affected Area. In the Applicant \u2019s Expert\u2019s  report tendered at\nthe hearing, he opined at paragraph 5.0(i):\n\u201c Following our site inspection of #XXX & #XXX, we are of the view \nthat there is an interflow water seepage problem originating from \nthe bathroom/ toilet in the utility room of #XXX .  \u201d \n21. Subsequently, it was noted at paragraphs 6.0(iii) and 6.0(iv) of the Expert\nReport, that further tests were required in order to validate his opinion. He\nrecommended that:\n\u201c In order to confirm our findings of the highly suspected area/s , \nwe strongly recommend a water ponding test to examine the \nwaterproofing of the toilet/bathroom in the utility room of #XXX. \nFurthe r, a wate r pressu re test is also recommended fo r the water \nsupply pipes.   \u201d \n(emphasis added) \n22. Based on the inspection done by the Applicant\u2019s Expert , he was of the opinion\nthat the water seepage at the Affected Area originated from the Respondent\u2019s\nUnit. Nevertheless, it is evident in paragraph 5.0(i) of the Expert Report that the\nsource of the water leakage was a mere opinion and cannot be regarded as\nconclusive without conducting the necessary tests stated at paragraphs 6.0(iii)\nand 6.0(iv) of the Expert Report.\n23. The Board finds that as the tests recommended in paragraphs 6.0(iii) and\n6.0(iv) of the Expert Report were not carried out, the Applicant\u2019s Expert was\nunable to ascertain with certainty, the cause of the leak that occurred at the\nAffected Area.7 STB 12 OF 2016 - SIMSVILLE  C. Timeline and correlation between Respondent\u2019 s repairs and stoppage of\nleak\n24. The Respondent, after commencement of this application and notwithstanding\nthat the source of the leak could not be attributed to him, engaged\nwaterproofing company, Winborne Pte Ltd to conduct a ponding test on 1 July\n2016 (Vegas Interior Design\u2019s ponding -test report filed on 4 July 2016). During\nthis ponding test, it was noted that there were no indications  of water leakage,\nsuch as blue-dyed water forming on the ceiling or walls of the Affected Area.\n25. The Respondent subsequently engaged Vegas Interior Design Pte Ltd to\nconduct further tests . Based on t he report filed on 26 July 2016, there was\nnothing to suggest that the Respondent was responsible for the leakage at the\nAffected Area. However, as a gesture of goodwill, the Respondent changed his\npiping from concealed to external piping.\n26. The Bo ard noted in both parties\u2019 submissions that even after the Respondent\nhad changed his concealed piping to external piping, the leakage was still\npresent. As further evidence was not adduced, there is no evidence to prove\nthat the cessation of the leak at the Affected Area was reasonably attributed to\nthe Respondent \u2019s repairs . Hence , the Board is of the view that the correlation\nbetween the repairs done by the Respondent and the cessation of the leak at\nthe Affected Area was too remote.\n27. Additionally, given the evidence before the Board, we are not persuaded by the\nApplicant \u2019s assertion  that the leak was attributed to the Respondent\u2019s U nit. As\nthe recommended tests set out in the Expert\u2019s Report were not carried out and\nthe Applicant\u2019s Expert was unable to confirm the cause of the leak to the\nAffected Area, a definitive conclusion as to the source of the leak could not be\ndrawn. Consequently, the Board is unable to attribute the damage caused by\nthe water seepage to the Respondent\u2019s water supply pipes in his unit.\n28. For the reasons set out above, the Board finds that the Applicant has failed to\nprove, on the balance of probabilities, that the cause of the leakage at the\nAffected Area was attributed to the Responden t\u2019s Unit, and thus the Applicant\nfails to succeed on their claims.8 STB 12 OF 2016 - SIMSVILLE  29. Ordinarily, the Board would have ordered the Applicant to pay the\nRespondent\u2019s costs as the Applicant has failed in their application. However,\nhaving considered the manner in which parties have conducted themselves\nthroughout the proceedings, including mediation, the Board orders that each\nparty be made to pay their own costs.\nDated this 29th day of September 2016 \nMR ALFONSO ANG \nPresident \nMR TAN EE PING  \nMember  \nMR CHNG BENG GUAN \nMember  "

On 19 May 2015, t he A pplicants f iled an application  for an order by a Strata Titles \nBoard (the \u201cBoard \u201d) under a Form 8 application, against: -  \n \n(a) The 1st Respondent,  the MCST of Solaris Residences , for the alleged failure to \ntake any steps to enforce the by -laws and/or directions made by the MCST; and  \n \n(b) The 2nd and 3rd Respondents for the alleged failure to comply with the \ndirections of the MCST.   \n \n2. The 2nd and 3rd Respondents  acted in person. The 2nd Respondent is an in -house legal \ncounsel whilst the 3rd Respondent is an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court \nand practices law with a law firm. The 3rd Respondent did not contest the matter \nthrough her firm but in her individual capacity. They  tendered a joint submission on 17 \nJune 2015 and the MCST tendered its submission on 19 June 2015 in respect of the \nApplicants\u2019 Form 8 application.   \n \nMediation   \n \n3. Where a Board has been constituted in respect of any dispute or matter to which it has \njurisdi ction under the Building Maintenance and Strata  Management Act (Cap 30C) \n(the \u201cAct\u2019), it shall endeavo ur to mediate all matters that are in dispute and to bring \nabout an agreement betwe en the parties on those matters, pursuant to Section 92(1)(a) \nof the Act.  Accordingly, the parties attended a total of three mediation sessions before \nthe Board on 18 August 2015, 22 September 2015 and 29 September 2015.   \n \n4. At the first mediation on 18 Au gust 2015,  the 2nd and 3rd Respondents objected to the \nApplicants  then solicitor  (M/s Tan Rajah & Cheah)  from acting for the Applicants as  \nSTB 24 of 2015 \u2013 Solaris Residences  3 \nthey had previously advised the 2nd and 3rd Respondents on issues related to the \nmatters arising out of the A pplicant s\u2019 Form 8 application. Consequently, the Board \nadjourned the medi ation session in order for the A pplicants \u2019 solicitor to consider the \nobjection and to engag e new solicitors, if required. M/s Tan Rajah & Cheah \ndischarged themselves from acting and M/s Quahe  Woo and Palmer LLC acted in their \nplace.  \n \n5. At the second mediation on 22 September 2015, pa rties were unable to settle the \ndispute.  Amongst other orders given by the Board, the Board also ordered for parties \nto attend another mediation and for parties to attempt to resolve the matter at the next \nmediation.  \n \n6. At the third mediation on 29 September 2015, parties were still unable to settle the \nmatter.  As a result, the Board gave further directions to hear parties, arbitrate the \nmatter and render a decision and make an order, pursuant to Section 92(1)(b) of the \nAct.  The Board fixed the matter for a two -day arbitral hearing on 3 and 4 November \n2015 and directed parties to submit and exchange their affidavits of evidence -in-chief \n(\u201cAEIC\u201d) beforehand by 15 Octo ber 2015.   \n \nArbitral hearing before the Board  \n \n7. On the first day of the hearing on 3 November 2015, the A pplicants\u2019 solicitors \nrequest ed for an adjournment a nd leave to amend the application. Objections were \nraised by all the Respondent s regarding the oral application that was made at the day \nof the hearing, more  so when affidavits of evidence -in-chiefs had been filed and the y \nwere ready to proceed with the hearing. The Board directed the Applicant s to file their \ninterlocutory application to amend their  application by way of Form 11 an d to do so by \n17 November 2015 and the hearing dates were vacated. The Board reserved costs of \nthe adjournment to the Respondents.   \n  \nSTB 24 of 2015 \u2013 Solaris Residences  4 \n8. The A pplicants\u2019 solicitors filed their interlocutory application to amend their \napplicati on by way  of Form 11 on 19 November 2015 and the application was heard \non 15 January 2016 allowing the application to amend. Costs of the application and \nconsequential amendments were awarded to the Respondents.  \n \n9. On 15 February 2016 the Board gave directio ns for the hearing of the amended \napplication and fixed the case for hearing on 25 and 26 April 2016. Leave was also \ngiven to the Respondents to file supplementary affidavits and submission s to address \nissues that were raised as a result of the amendments by 7 March 2016.  \n \n10. On 1 March 2016, the Applicant s withdrew their entire application of STB 24 of 2015.  \n \nCosts ordered in favour of the Respondent s  \n \n11. The Board reserved its decision on the amount of costs in respect of the following \nitems: -  \n \nA. Applicants\u2019 adjournment of the arbitral hearing on 3 and 4 November 2015;  \n \nB. Applicants\u2019 interlocutory application to amend their initial Form 8 application; \nand  \n \nC. Applicants\u2019 withdrawal of their application and the matter being discontinued.  \n \n12.

Adjournment of hearing   \nSTB 24 of 2015 \u2013 Solaris Residences  5 \n \n13. On the first day of the hearing on 3 November 2015, the Applicant s\u2019 solicitors raised \ndifferent issues from that of their prayers in the Applicant s\u2019 AEIC.  The Applicant s \nhad not provided prior warning to the Board and/or the Respondent s of their intention \nto amend their prayers.  \n \n14. Subsequently, the Applicant s\u2019 solicitors sought  leave of the Board to amend the \nApplicant s\u2019 initial Form 8 application.  The hearing on 3 November 2015 was \ntherefore adjourned to allow the Applicant s to file their interlocutory application to \namend their Form 8 application.   \n \n15. The Board is of the view that after parties had submitted and exchanged their AEICs \non 15 October 2015, the Applicant s had more than sufficient time to write to the Board \nand th e Respondent s to inform them of their intention to am end their initial \napplication , and not attempt to amend their prayers by oral submission on the hearing \nof 3 November 2015.   \n \n \nB. Amendment of application  \n \n16. At the 15 February 2016 hearing, the Board had already ordered costs of the \ninterlocutory application to amend the Applicant s\u2019 application and consequential \namendments in favour of the Respondent s.   \n \n17. Whenever a party amends his pleadings, in this case, th e Applicant s amending their \ninitial Form 8 application, there are costs incurred by the amendment and \u201ccosts \nthrown away\u201d by reasons of the amendment.    \n \n18. In relation to \u2018costs thrown away \u2019, the author of Singapore Court Practice 2009 state s \nat paragraph 59/1/14 :  \n  \nSTB 24 of 2015 \u2013 Solaris Residences  6 \nCosts thrown away refers to the specific situation in which costs have been \nwasted by a party\u2026  \n \nThe order is also appropriate when costs have been occasioned by an \namendment (see State of Perak v PRALMM Muthukaruppan Chettiar [1938] \nMLJ 247) or a djournment\u2026 The important question of exactly what costs are \nrecoverable as costs thrown away by reason of an adjournment (sometimes \nreferred to as \u2018costs of the day \u2019) was considered in Choo Ah Kiat v Ang Kim \nHock [1983]  2 MLJ xciv, which concerned the adjournment of a trial at the \nbehest of the plaintiff.  The deputy registrar accepted the principle that \u2018costs \nthrown away \u2019 by an adjournment refer to \u2018costs that have been incurred and \nwhich must be incurred over again \u2019, and therefore have been thrown away in \nconsequence of the adjournment.  \n \n19. Upon the Board\u2019s leave for the Applicant s to amend their application, the costs \nincurred from the Respondent s\u2019 preparation of their initial AEICs would have been \n\u201cwasted\u201d or \u201cthrown awa y\u201d.  The Respondent s would also have to prepare and file \ntheir supplementary AEICs in response to the Applicant s\u2019 amended application.   \n \n20. Accordingly, the Board is of the view that insofar as the Applicant s had amended their \ninitial Form 8 application, the Respondent s are entitled to wasted costs  and costs \nconsequential to the amended application.  \n \nC. Applicants\u2019 withdrawal of their application and the matter being discontinued  \n \n21. On 1 March 2016, the Applicants withdrew their entire application of STB 2 4 of 2015. \nThis was after directions were given by the Board for the hearing of the amended \napplication and the filing of supplementary affidavits and submissions. Given the \nApplicants\u2019 decision to withdraw the application after the AEIC stage, it was clear to \nthe Board  that the Respondents are entitled to the costs of the whole application. The \nonly issue before the Board is the amount of costs to be awarded.   \nSTB 24 of 2015 \u2013 Solaris Residences  7 \nIssue on quantum  \n \n22. The Board will address the following issues that were raised by all parties namely:  \n \n(a) The Applicants\u2019 submission that no costs should be made , or in the alternative , a \ncost of not more than $1 ,500.00 as an award of costs other than minimal would \nlead to further friction strain ing the relationship amongst parties.  \n \n(b) The 1st Respondent\u2019s submission that costs be awarded on an indemnity basis. \nThey contended that solicitor and client costs was in the region of $45,000.00 with \ndisbursements of $1,434.50 and it would be unfair for all the subsidiary proprietors \nof this small dev elopment to bear the costs as a result of this case which was \nunduly prosecuted by the Applicants.  \n \n(c) The Applicants\u2019 contention that no costs ought to be awarded to the 2nd and 3rd \nRespondents notwithstanding that they are advocates and solicitors as they h ad \nacted in person.  The 2nd and 3rd Respondents  asked for a sum in the total of \n$5,134.36; this amount represents the loss that they w ill incur in having to \ncontribute towards the maintenance fund in connection with the proceedings for \nthis application.  \n \n \nDECISION  \n \n23. The Board\u2019s power to award costs arises from Section 117(1) of the Act, where the \nBoard has wide discretion to award costs as the Board thinks fit.   \n \nApplicants \u2019 submission of  no costs or  minimal costs  \n \n24. The Board ende avours at all the mediations to facilitate a settlement amongst \ndisputing parties. This role is crucial as  the Board  hope s that compromised  \nSTB 24 of 2015 \u2013 Solaris Residences  8 \nsettlement s through the efforts of the parties would foster good relationship s amongst \npeople staying  in close proximity.  Settlement leads to the prospect of maximum \ncontinuity of friendship and minimi ses ranco ur.  \n \n25. In this case, as in all other cases held before any of the boards, members of this  Board \nplayed an active facilitati ve role in bridging  the parties\u2019  differences. This case was \nprolonged unnecessarily primarily as a result of the Applicants. To some extent, the \n2nd and 3rd Respondents had been  aware or ought to be aware that the Applicants \nintended to disqualify M/s Tan Rajah & Cheah  and should  have raised this issu e \nearlier . Therefore, they are also partly responsible for the delay of this case.  \n \n26. The Applicants had many opportunities to reach some form of compromise but did \nnot do so. They had not settled the matter despite the mediations  and adjourned the \nhearing of the matter  on the first day that it was fixed for hearing when the \nRespondents were ready to proceed. T he Applicants \u2019 amend ments to  their application \nresulted in the Respondents having to file supplemen tary affidavits and submissions,  \nthereby prolong ing the matter unnecessarily. It is ironic  that the  Applicants  should \nsubmit that they should not pay any costs, or in the alternative, pay only nominal \ncosts so that parties can carry on with their lives and that an award of costs against \nthem would cause st rain to their future relationship.  \n \n1st Respondent\u2019s costs  \n \n27. The Board considered the argument that the 1st Respondent should be awarded full \ncosts on indemnity basis as the costs paid by the MSCT to their solicitors amounted \nto $45,000.00 with disbursement s of $1,434.50  and it would penalis e the other \nsubsidiary proprietors who would have to contribute to the costs of the Applicants\u2019 \npursuit of the matter.  \n \n28. We do not have sufficient facts before us to justify that the Applicants be penalised \nwith costs on an indemnity basis. It behooved on the MSCT to on their part manage \nlegal costs more so when it has a small number of proprietors who would contribute  \nSTB 24 of 2015 \u2013 Solaris Residences  9 \nto su ch costs. The issues before the Board were not complex. Accordingly , costs \nwould be awarded on the standard basis that is usually awarded in cases before the \nboards.  \n \nCosts to the 2nd and 3rd Respondents  \n \n29. The 2nd and 3rd Respondents as litigants in persons  are clearly entitled to reasonable \ncompensation for their time and disbursements incurred. Where a litigant is a \nsolicitor, he is entitled upon  taxation of his costs to the same costs as if he had \nemployed a solicitor except to such charges as are rendere d unnecessary by his acting \nin person ( Malkinson v Trim  [2002] EWCA Civ 1273). The Board in awarding the \nquantum bore in mind that the 2nd Respondent is an in -house legal counsel and that \nthe 3rd Respondent had not defended the case through her law firm in which she \npracticed. In short, both acted in persons and it could not be said that any law firm \nwhich they may be associated with  was involved.  \n \n30. The Board will award costs to the 2nd and 3rd Respondents based on what it \ndetermines to be reasonable, disregarding the fact that the 3rd Respondent is an \nadvocate  and solicitor . \n \n31. The Board accordingly  order s that the Applicants pay costs as follows: - \n \ni) $12,000.00, plus disbursements of $1,434.50, to the  1st Respondent ; \n \nii) $4,000.00 to the 2nd and 3rd Respondents; and  \n \niii) Applicants to pay S trata Titles Boards  fees amounting to $1,350 .00 consist ing \nof the following  fees:  \n \n(a) direction h earing on 29 Sept ember  2015   : $150 ; \n \n(b) hearing on 3 Nov ember 2015 (adjourned)   : $300 ;  \nSTB 24 of 2015 \u2013 Solaris Residences  10 \n \n(c) interlo cutory h earing on 15 Jan uary 2016   : $150 ; \n \n(d) direction h earing on 15 Feb ruary  2016   : $150 ; \n \n(e) hearing (on costs) on 11 Apr il 2016    : $300 ; and  \n \n(f) delivery of judgment  on 10 May 2016   : $300 . \n \n \n \nDated this 10th day of May 2016 . \n \n \n \n \n         \n        MR ALFONSO ANG  \n        President  \n \n \n         \n \n        MS LEE LAY SEE  \n        Member  \n \n \n \n                \n        MR TAN KIAN HOON  \n        Member  "

The Applicant is the subsidiary proprietor of a penthouse unit at 15 Ardmore Park \n#XXX Ardmore Park Condominium. S259959. The unit comprises two (2) levels  \nat levels 29 and 30. The Respondent is the management corporation of the \ncondominium (the MCST).\n2. Sometime in or about Nov 2011 (RB1 pg 47) the Applicant submitted an \napplication for works to be carried out at his unit viz Demolition of non-structural  \nwalls; Removal of unwanted existing trunking, cable trays, wires, AC ductings; \nLaying of new electrical, data, water, ACMV, telephony services; Erection of new \nwalls and partitions; Replacement of doors and window panels; Laying of new \nwall and floor finishes; Install new ceiling, painting works & install new cabinetry.\n3. It was not stated in the application that the works were to be carried out in areas \nother than in the Applicant \u2019s lot. The application was approved. The completion  \ndate was 13/03/2012. Work was not completed by the due date and there were \nnumerous applications for extension of time.\n4. In Aug 2013, in the course of inspections the MCST discovered that the fixed \nglass panelling at two areas of the Applicant \u2019s unit had been replaced with sliding  \npanels. Just outside the fixed panelling were balcony-like structures (ledges that  \nwere enclosed by a parapet 0.75m high). The Applicant had installed timber \ndecking on the ledges (Work-1). The Applicant \u2019s representative was informed via \nan email dated 26/08/2013 (RB1 pgs 66 and 67) that what was done was \nunauthorised and he was requested to reinstate the fixed glass panelling. Inter \nalia clause 3.5 of the by-laws ( Residents shall not without written consent of the \nManagement carry out any alterations or install any fittings or fixtures that  deviate \nfrom the approved plans and specifications) of the condominium was drawn to his \nattention. Via an email dated 27/08/12 (RB1 pg 66) the Applicant \u2019s representative \nreplied that the Applicant had \u201c\u2026just loose lay of the wooden  flooring\u2026\u201d on the \n\u201cbalconies \u201d because the existing floor tiles were discoloured,  uneven and \ncracked and were affecting the interior decoration.  He further informed that the \ncontractor had been instructed to seal off the sliding doors.3 STB 40 of 2015 \u2013 Ardmore Park Condominium  5. On 28/08/13 the Applicant was informed (RB1 pg 65) to submit a formal\napplication to install timber on the \u201cbalconies \u201d before the management council\nmet on 14/09/13. On 29/08/13 the MCST was informed that a formal application\n(RB1 pg 69) would be submitted and that the Applicant would remove the timber\nboarding  if approval was not given by council. On 03/09/13 (RB1 pg 70) an\napplication, addressed to The Management Council (MCST Plan 2645)  for\napproval was submitted and on 16/09/13 (RB1 pg 74) the Applicant was\ninformed that it was the view of the management council that the application was\nan application for exclusive use of common property and the council had no\njurisdiction to grant this. The Applicant was advised to sponsor a 90% resolution\nat the next AGM (S 33(1 )(c) of the Building Maintenance and Strata Management\nAct Cap 30C (the Act) provides that a management corporation can pursuant to\na 90% resolution confer on a subsidiary proprietor exclusive use and enjoyment\nof, or special privileges in respect of the whole or any part of common property\nfor a period exceeding 3 years).\n6. On or about 05/05/2014 the MCST \u2019s representative discovered that the Applicant\nhad installed timber decking on the flat roof at level 30 outside his unit (Work-2).\nThe timber decking covered the entire flat roof including the floor trap and\ndrainage system. The flat roof was accessible to the Applicant via the back door\nof the kitchen of his lot. It was also accessible to all subsidiary proprietors in the\ncondominium via a common staircase. According to the Applicant, parquet\nflooring  had been installed because \u201c\u2026the original floor was very dirty and\nslippery whenever it was wet \u2026\u201d (RB1 pg 104).\n7. On 12/05/2014 the MCST discovered that the Applicant had installed an air-\nconditioning vent on the wall of the common property (Work-3). The Applicant\nhad installed a ventilation unit because \u201c\u2026Ardmore Park had been built more\nthan 10 years and there was no adequate ventilation system in the penthouse. In\nconsideration of the health and well-being of the residents and to avoid any\npossible leakage of the aircon system a small ventilation unit was installed \u2026\u201d\n(RB1 pg 104).\n8. On or about 28/05/2014 (RB1 pg 98) when the structures had yet to be removed,\nthe Applicant was informed that \u201c\u2026The Management shall have full right and4 STB 40 of 2015 \u2013 Ardmore Park Condominium  authority to remove/demolish all unauthorised works after giving 14 days \u2019 \nnotice\u2026.\u201d.  Following this, the Applicant \u2019s representative replied to say that the \nworks were in \u201c\u2026a secluded place where nobody else had access save for the \nSubsidiary Proprietor of #XXX\u201d and that the Applicant was in the process of \n\u201c\u2026tabling a proposal under S 34 of the BMSMA for the conversion of the \ncommon area to private usage\u2026\u201d (RB1 pg 104). The Applican t was informed that \nconversion o f common areas to private usage would require approval from the \ngeneral body and that he should requisition for a general meeting for the general \nbody o f subsidiary proprietors to consider and pass the appropriate resolutions to \nallow the Applican t to retain the unauthorised structure s. The Applican t did not \ndo this and on 15/07/2014 took the position (RB1 pg 130) that the unauthorised \nstructures were not installed on common proper ty and/or common areas and did \nnot affe ct the external facade , structural integri ty and/or the intere sts o f the \nmanagemen t corporation or other subsidiary proprietors and proposed that the \nApplican t be allowed to give an undertaking to maintain and service the \nstructures a t his own cost. \n9. On 29/08/2014 (RB1 pg 132) the Applicant was inter alia informed \u201c\u2026that if the\nunauthorised structures are not removed within 14 days the MCST will take such\nsteps as necessary to remove the said structures from the common area \u2026.\u201d. \n10. On 24/09/2014 (RB1 pg 137) the Applicant via solicitors inter alia informed the\nMCST \u201c\u2026Your assertion that the structures are unauthorised structures in\ncommon areas is without basis \u2026\u201d.\n11. On 11/11/2014 the MCST via solicitors set out its position that the unauthorised\nstructures were on common property and/or common areas. An offer was made\nby the Applicant to submit the dispute to mediation at the Singapore Mediation\nCentre. The MCST did not agree as it was of the view that it was for the general\nbody to decide whether or not to allow the Applicant to the use of the common\nproperty in the manner that he had done.\n12. At the AGM on 25/04/2015 the Applicant tabled a motion for the meeting to, by\nway of a 90% resolution make a by-law conferring on him exclusive use and\nenjoyment and/or special privileges on proposed terms and conditions in respect5 STB 40 of 2015 \u2013 Ardmore Park Condominium  of the common property where the works had been carried out for more than 3 \nyears; alternatively by way of a 75% resolution for less than 3 years; alternatively \nby way of an ordinary resolution for a period not exceeding one year. The \nApplicant did not succeed on any of his three motions.  \n13. On 30/06/2015 the Applicant filed this Application in STB 40/2015 and applied for \nthe following orders to be made by the Board:\n1. A declaration pursuant to S 101(1)(c) of the BMSMA that the Applicant is \nnot in breach of his duty under the by-laws relating to the subdivided  \nbuilding by virtue of the installation of the following structures:\n(a) the timber decking located at the balconies/planter boxes of Tower 15 \nUnit #XXX at level 29 within the SP\u2019s side of the lot; and/or\n(b) the air-conditioning ventilation unit located along the exterior surface of \nthe wall enclosing Tower 15 Unit #XXX at level 30; and/or\n(c) the timber decking located at the open deck of level 30 outside Tower \n15 Unit #X XX, (collectively the \u201cInstallations \u201d);\n2. In the alternative to Prayer 1 above:\n(a) a declaration that the Installations did not amount to an exclusive use \nand enjoyment of or the conferment of special privileges in respect of \ncommon property within the meaning of S 33 of the BMSMA;\n(b) an order pursuant to S 111(a) of the BMSMA that the Respondent  \nconsents to the Applicant \u2019s proposal to effect alterations to the \ncommon property by way of the Installations;\n(c) a declaration pursuant to S 101(1)(c) read with S 101(4) of the \nBMSMA that the Respondent has failed to exercise its powers under  S \n37(4) of the BMSMA;\n(d) an order pursuant to S 111(b) of the BMSMA that the Respondent  \nauthorise the Installations as improvement(s) in or upon the \nApplicant \u2019s lot that do not detract from the appearance nor affect the \nstructural integrity of any building comprised in the strata title plan6 STB 40 of 2015 \u2013 Ardmore Park Condominium  under S 37(4) of the BMSMA on such terms as the Applicant has \nproposed and/or as the Honourable Board may impose.  \n14. It can be noted that except for the prayers in 2(b) and 2(d) the Applicant was\nseeking for declaratory orders. The Board was aware that such orders had never\nbeen made by any Board and was not satisfied that it had the power to make\nsuch an order. Accordingly, parties were directed to make the necessary\nsubmissions as to whether the Board had the power to make such an order.\n15. It was the submission of the Applicant that in view of the wording of S 101 of the\nBuilding Maintenance and Strata Management Act Cap 30C (the Act),\ndeclaratory orders could be made.  On the part of the MCST, it was submitted\nthat a Board is a creature of statute and there are no provisions in the Act (unlike\nS 31(2(b) of the State Courts Act. Cap 321 and Order 15 Rule 16 of the Rules of\nCourt) empowering a Board to make such an order. The MCST also referred to\nMark Wheeler v Management Corporation Strata Title Plan 751 and Anor [2003]\nSGSTB 5 (Mark Wheeler) where the Board in that case had pronounced that\n\u201c\u2026the Board has no jurisdiction to make a declaratory judgement \u2026\u201d With regard\nto S 119(2) of the Act which refers to declaratory orders made by a Board, it was\nsubmitted that the section had to be read in conjunction with SS 103, 104 and\n106 of the Act.\n16. Before deciding if the Board does in fact have the power to make a declaratory\norder, the Board considered that it would be in order to determine if there was\nany merit in the applications i.e. is the Applicant correct in his  assertions. If so,\nthen before the orders sought can be made, the Board would have to determine\nif there is in fact a power for the Board to make the orders.\n17. It was the case for the Applicant that the orders applied for should be made in his\nfavour because works had not been carried out on common property and there\nwas no breach of the applicable by-laws. It was the case for the MCST that\nunauthorised works had been carried out on common property/common areas in\nbreach of the applicable by-laws. The applicable by-laws are By-Law 5 of the\nprescribed by-laws in The Building Maintenance (Strata Management)\nRegulations 2005 and Clauses 2, 4 and 8 of by-laws passed by MCST under\nS 32(3) of the Act (the ABL).7 STB 40 of 2015 \u2013 Ardmore Park Condominium  18. By-law 5 of the prescribed by-laws is as follows:\n5.\u2013\u2013(1)   A subsidiary proprietor or an occupier shall not mark , paint , drive nails\nor screws or the like into , or otherwise damage or deface, any structure that\nforms part of the common property except with the prior written a pproval of the\nmanagement corporation.\n5.\u2013\u2013(3)   This by -law shall not prevent a subsidiary proprietor or an occupier of a\nlot, or a person authorised by such subsidiary proprietor or occupier from\ninstalling  \u2013\u2013 (a) any locking or other safety device for protection of the\nsubsidiary proprietor or occupier \u2019s lot against intruders or to improve safety\nwithin the lot; (b) any screen or other device to prevent entry of animals or\ninsects on the lot; (c) any structure or device to prevent harm to children; or ( d)\nany device used to affix decorative items to  the internal surfaces of walls in the\nsubsidiary proprietor \u2019s or occupier \u2019s lot.\n19. Clause 8.1.1 of the ABL is as follows:\nThe subsidiary proprietor shall submit to the Management the prescribed\napplication form for renovation works together with a detailed work schedule at\nleast 10 working days prior to the commencement of any renovation works.\n20. Clause 8.2.5 of the ABL is as follows :\nThe subsidiary proprietor and his contractor can only carry out the type of work\nspecified in the approval letter given by the Management.\nPrayer 1:  \nWas there a breach of the applicable by-laws  \n21. It was the submission of the Applicant that he was not in breach of By-law 5\nbecause works had not been carried out on common property. In the event that\nworks had been carried out on common property, it was permissible by virtue of\nBy-law 5(3) for the works to have been carried out.\nWork- 1:\nSection 2(1) of the Act defines common property as follows:8 STB 40 of 2015 \u2013 Ardmore Park Condominium  2.\u2014(1) In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires \u2014 \n\u2026  \n\"common property\", subject to subsection (9), means \u2014  \n(a) in relation to any land and building comprised or to be comprised in a strata\ntitle plan, such part of the land and building \u2014 \n(i) not comprised in any lot or proposed lot in that strata title plan; and\n(ii) used or capable of being used or enjoyed by occupiers of 2 or more lots or\nproposed lots; or \n(b) in relation to any other land and building, such part of the land and buildi ng \u2013\n(i) not comprised in any non-strata lot; and\n(ii) used or capable of being used or enjoyed by occupiers of 2 or more non-\nstrata lots within that land or building. \n22. Accordingly two conditions have to be satisfied before any land and building\ncomprised in a strata title plan can fall within the definition of common property:\n(a) it is not comprised in any lot or proposed lot in that strata title plan; and (b) it\nis used or capable of being used or enjoyed by occupiers of two or more lots. \n23. With regard to Work-1 there is no access to the two areas. It is on the outside of,\ninitially fixed glass panelling but now it is on the outside of sealed glass doors.\nWhilst the areas are not comprised in any lot (it is not in dispute that it is not in\nthe Applicant \u2019s lot) it does not appear that anyone can access and physically use\nand enjoy the two areas. Accordingly, it was the submission of the Applicant that\nthe areas are not common property.\n24. The MCST submitted that in the certified strata title plans the two are as were\nmarked as common property of the estate and had fallen within the MCST \u2019s\npurview since the MCST was constituted. There was however no submission as\nto whether the areas were used or were capable of being used or enjoyed by\noccupiers of 2 or more lo ts.9 STB 40 of 2015 \u2013 Ardmore Park Condominium  25. The Oxford Learners Dictionary defines \u201cuse\u201d as \u201ctake, hold or deploy\n(something) as a means of accomplishing or achieving something \u201d. \u201cEnjoy\u201d is\ndefined as \u201cto get pleasure from something \u201d. The Board noted that the two areas\nin Work-1 i.e. ledge with low parapet wall is a feature of the building. It is not\nknown whether such feature is provided at other floors or other parts of the\nbuilding.  Its designed purpose is subject to speculation.  In any case, it is\nobvious that if it is removed, it will affect the appearance of the building. It is part\nand parcel of the fabric of the building and contributes to the character and\nappearance. Hence its presence provides for quiet enjoyment of the feature to all\nsubsidiary proprietors.  It is also obvious that it serves as a shelter or sunshade\nto the unit/units below it.\n26. In the case of Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 367 v Lee Siew\nYuen and Another  [2014] SGHC 161 Tan Siong Thye J inter alia noted that whilst\nthe current definition of common property in the Act, which is a simplified\ndefinition when compared with the definition before the amendment in 2005,\nParliament did not intend to change the definition. At paragraph 33 of the\njudgement the learned judge said\n\u201cThe purpose behind the definition of common property under s 2(1) of the\nBMSMA is to exclude from common property those objects that are solely\nconstructed within the subsidiary proprietor \u2019s unit for the enjoyment of the\nsubsidiary proprietor only. This is consistent with the term \u201ccommon \u201d, which\nindicates that the particular property must serve a common purpose. \u201d\n27. There was no dispute that the two areas are marked as common property in the\ncertified strata title plans and whilst subsidiary proprietors cannot access the two\nareas, the areas are  in fact used and enjoyed by all the subsidiary proprietors.\nThe two areas are common property.\n28. In Clause 2(g) of the ABL, \u201ccommon areas \u201d is defined as all the area in the\ncondominium with the exception of strata lots.  The two areas in Work-1 were not\nin the Applicant \u2019s lot and in accordance with the definition of \u201ccommon areas \u201d\nthey were in the common areas of the condominium. It is not clear if the\nApplicant is disputing that there was a breach of the Clause 8 of the Additional\nBy-laws when works were carried out in the two areas. It was however the10 STB 40 of 2015 \u2013 Ardmore Park Condominium  submission of the Applicant that the provisions of the ABL were inconsistent with \nthe provisions of the Act and the BMSMR and should be disregarded. It was \nsubmitted that when there has not been a breach in connection with common \nproperty under the Act or the prescribed by-laws there cannot be a liability under \nthe ABL in connection with \u201ccommon areas \u201d when the common areas are not \n\u201ccommon property \u201d under the Act.  \n29. Whilst the definition of common areas  in ABL is not the same as the definition of\ncommon property  in the Act, the Board cannot find that by-laws in connection\nwith common areas  are inconsistent with the Act. Under S 32 (3) of the Act \u201c\u2026a\nmanagement corporation may \u2026make by-laws for the purpose of controlling and\nmanaging the use or enjoyment of the parcel comprised in the strata title plan \u2026.\u201d \ni.e. by-laws can be made for the purpose of controlling and managing all the\nareas of the estate. This would include common property and all other parts of \nthe estate. By-laws are statutorily constituted contracts between the \nmanagement corporation and the subsidiary proprietors and between the \nsubsidiary proprietors inter se ( Choo Kok Lin v MCST Plan 2405  [2005] SGHC \n144) It is also provided in S 33(6) of the Act that prescribed by-laws and by-laws\nmade under S 33 \u201c\u2026bind the management corporation and the subsidiary  \u2026as if \nthe by-laws \u2013 (a) had been signed and sealed by the management corporation \nand each subsidiary proprietor \u2026; and (b) contained mutual covenants to observe \ncomply and perform all the provisions of the by-laws \u201d. The Board does not agree \nthat the ABL are inconsistent with the Act and should be disregarded. It was also  \nthe submission of the Applicant that he had complied with Clause 8.1.1 because \nan application for permission to carry out renovation works had been submitted. \nWhilst this is true, the application submitted and approved in Nov 2011 was not \nfor work to be done outside of the Applicant \u2019s lot. An application for approval of \nthe works in Work-1 was submitted on 03/09/2013 after the MCST became \naware of the works but the application was not approved.  \n30. It is the finding of the Board that there was a breach of Clause 8.1.1 and 8.2.5 of\nthe ABL when Work-1 was carried out.11 STB 40 of 2015 \u2013 Ardmore Park Condominium  31. Work-2 and Work 3 were carried out on the flat roof outside of the Applicant \u2019s lot\nand on the outside wall of Tower 15. It is not in dispute that the flat roof is\naccessible to all subsidiary proprietors of the estate via a common staircase. I t\nwas submitted by the Applicant that even though the flat roof and the outside wall\ncan be used or was capable of being used or enjoyed by the occupiers of 2 or\nmore units the areas were not common property because they were not meant\nfor common usage.\n32. The two areas are not comprised in any lot or proposed lot in the strata title plan\nand are used or capable of being used or enjoyed by the occupiers of 2 or more\nlots. The Act does not require that property must be \u201cmeant for common usage \u201d\nbefore it can be considered to be common property. In the case of Re Faber\nGarden (Strata Titles Plan N0 1047 ) [1993] SGSTB 1 the Board had agreed with\na submission \u201c\u2026that there has to be present the ingredient of central or common\nusage before a property is categorised as common property \u2026\u201d. This was in the\ncontext of deciding that a water heater and storage tank that was supplied by the\ndeveloper for the exclusive use of an apartment and affixed on the roof of the\napartment was not common property. The finding of the Board in that case is not\napplicable to the case at hand. There is also no merit in the submission that the\nareas were not meant for common usage as there was no evidence that the two\nareas in Work-2 and Work-3 are not meant for common usage.\n33. The two areas in Work-2 and Work-3 are common property.\nWas there a breach of duty under the by-laws when the works were carried out?  \n34. It is clear that a subsidiary proprietor is allowed to install on common property\nany locking or safety devices for protection  of his lot against intruders ; or to\nimprove safety within his lot. The subsidiary proprietor is also allowed to install\nany structure or device to prevent harm to children.\n35. In the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary a \u201cdevice\u201d is defined as \u201can object\nor a piece of equipment that has been designed to do a particular job \u201d. A locking\nor safety device in By -law 5(3) of the prescribed by -laws would be an object or a\npiece of equipment that has been designed for or can be used for the protection12 STB 40 of 2015 \u2013 Ardmore Park Condominium  of the subsidiary proprietor \u2019s lot against intruders or improve safety within the lot \nor prevent harm to children.  \n36. It was the submission of the Applicant that the aircon ventilation unit and timber\nflooring were erected in the interests of the Applicant \u2019s or occupiers \u2019 welfare,\nhealth and/or safety. It was also the submission of the Applicant that his children\nhad respiratory tract allergies and the installation of the aircon ventilation unit\nwas necessary to promote cleaner air circulation within his unit.\n37. As noted above, the by-law allows a subsidiary proprietor to install a locking or\nsafety device for the protection  against intruders or improve safety within the lot.\nWhilst timber flooring may prevent floors from becoming overly slippery when wet\nand an aircon and ventilation system can improve air quality the Board cannot\nfind that the aircon ventilation unit and timber flooring are locking or safety\ndevices for the protection of the Applicant \u2019s lot against intruders. They are also\nnot devices that could improve safety within the Applicant \u2019s lot.\n38. The by-law allows a subsidiary proprietor to install a safety device to prevent\nharm  to his children. Whilst an air-con and ventilation system can improve air\nquality, the Board cannot find that the air-con ventilation unit and timber flooring\non the flat roof are safety devices installed to prevent  harm  to the children.\n39. As in the case of Work-1 the Applicant had not submitted an application for\nrenovation works together with a detailed work schedule prior to the\ncommencement of the works in Work-2 and Work- 3.\n40. It is the finding of the Board that there was a breach of By-law 5 of the prescribed\nby-laws and Clause 8.1.1 and 8.2.5 of the ABL when the works in Work-2 and\nWork-3 were carried out.\nPrayer 2(a):  \nDid the works result in an exclusive use and enjoyment of or the conferment of \nspecial privileges in respect of common property within the meaning of S 33 of \nthe Act  13 STB 40 of 2015 \u2013 Ardmore Park Condominium  41. The submission of the Applicant was that there was in this case no need for a by-\nlaw under S 33 of the Act to be passed because there was no exclusive use and\nenjoyment of the areas where the works had been carried out and he has also\nnot been conferred any special privileges in respect of the areas.\n42. S 33 of the Act provides that a management corporation can, with the written\nconsent of the subsidiary proprietor of a lot, make a by-law conferring upon the\nsubsidiary proprietors the exclusive use and enjoyment or grant special\nprivileges in respect of the whole or any part of the common property upon\nconditions (including payment of money). For a period not exceeding 1 year, by\nway of an ordinary resolution; for a period exceeding 1 year but not exceeding 3\nyears, by way of a special resolution; and for a period exceeding 3 years, by way\nof a 90% resolution. The by-law must also provide for the management\ncorporation to be responsible for carrying out its duties under S 29(1) of the Act\ni.e. controlling, managing, administering and maintaining the common property or\nprovide for the subsidiary proprietor to be responsible for the duties of the \nmanagement corporation.  \n43. Whilst a finding can be made that there was no exclusive use and enjoyment or\nconferment of special privileges with regard to Work-1, and Work- 2 \u2013 because,\nwith regard to Work-1 all other SPs including the Applicant could not access the\narea after the sliding panels had been sealed; and with regard to the area in\nWork-2, all SPs including the Applicant could access, use and enjoy the area \u2013\nthe same cannot be said for the area in Work- 3.\n44. It was the submission of the Applicant that the fact that the ventilation unit was\ninstalled along the exterior surface of the wall did not prevent the use of the wall\nby other occupiers or subsidiary proprietors.\n45. In the case of Mark Wheeler v The Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No\n751 and Another  [2003] SGSTB 5 the subsidiary proprietor had installed a\nretractable awning/canopy at the balcony of the front entrance of his unit. The\nBoard in that case was obliged to consider whether the putting up of the\nretractable canopy was exclusive use of common property. The Board, after inter\nalia referring to \u201cStrata Title Management and the Law \u2019 by Alex Ilkin where the14 STB 40 of 2015 \u2013 Ardmore Park Condominium  author cited that installation of an air conditioner in the wall of the common \nproperty and enclosing a balcony as examples of having exclusive use of \ncommon property, found that the installation of the awning amounted to having \nexclusive use of common property.  \n46. The installation of the air-con vent on the wall would prevent the use of the\nportion of the wall where it was installed from being used and enjoyed by other\noccupiers and subsidiary proprietors. The management corporation whose duty it\nis, under S 29(1)(2) of the Act to properly maintain and keep in a state of good\nand serviceable repair (including where reasonably necessary renew or replace\nthe whole or part thereof) common property would not be able to do the\nnecessary with regard to that part of the wall where the air-con vent was\ninstalled.\n47. It is the finding of the Board that there was exclusive use and enjoyment of or the\nconferment of special privileges in respect of common property within the\nmeaning of S 33 of the Act.\nPrayer 2(b):     \nApplication for an order under S 111(a) of the Act  \n48. S 111(a) of the Act is as follows:\nWhere pursuant to an application by a subsidiary proprietor, a Board considers\nthat a management corporation \u2026(a) has unreasonably refused to consent to a\nproposal by that subsidiary proprietor to effect alterations to common\nproperty\u2026the Board may make an order that the management corporation\nconsents to the proposal.\n49. It was the submission of the Applicant that he had made \u201c\u2026various attempts to\npropose terms and conditions relating to the installations \u2026\u201d and the Respondent\nhad \u201c\u2026unreasonably refused to consider and consent to the proposals \u2026\u201d.\n50. It was the submission of the MCST that the \u201c\u2026clear meaning of S 111(a) is\nprospective in nature. The provision contemplates a proposal by the subsidiary15 STB 40 of 2015 \u2013 Ardmore Park Condominium  proprietor to the MCST to effect an alteration or addition onto the common \nproperty of the estate \u2026\u201d. \n51. The facts are that the MCST had discovered that the Applicant had carried out\nthe works in Work-1, Work-2, and Work-3 without first submitting an applicati on\nfor the works to be done and without having obtained any approval from the\nMCST. Whilst the Applicant had submitted an application in connection with\nWork-1 after the work had been carried out the application was not approved\nbecause the MCST considered that the management council did not have the\njurisdiction and power to approve the application. With regard to the works in\nWork-2 and Work-3 the Applicant had made proposals to be allowed to retain\nwhat had been done but there were no applications made for the carrying out of\nthe works. In connection with the proposals to retain the works, there was no\nevidence that the MCST did not agree because the MCST did not approve or\nwas in any way against what had been done. The management council did not\nagree to the proposals because they were of the view that they did not have the\njurisdiction or power to agree.\n52. It was also the submission of the Applicant that the MCST was wrong when the\nMCST did not agree to the proposals on the basis that the MCST did not hav e\nthe jurisdiction and power to agree because under S 58(1) and S 58(4) of the Act\nthe management council is not prohibited from and has the power to decide on\nany matter which only required an ordinary resolution such as the creation of a\nby-law to grant exclusive use of common property for a period not exceeding 1\nyear.\n53. Until the AGM in April 2015 when the meeting was called upon to consider a\nmotion in connection for a period not exceeding one year after motions in\nconnection with exclusive use for a period exceeding 3 years and a period not\nexceeding 3 years had failed there were, in this case no applications or\nproposals made by the Applicant in connection with the works for exclusive use\nfor a period not exceeding one year. There was never any mention of the period\nover which the Applicant was seeking to retain the works and from the\ncorrespondence between the parties it appeared to be understood that it was for16 STB 40 of 2015 \u2013 Ardmore Park Condominium  more than 3 years. On 16/09/13, the MCST had advised the Applicant to sponsor \na 90% Resoluti on. \n54. The Board is in this case not satisfied that the MCST had unreasonably refused\nto consent to a proposal by the Applicant to effect alterations to common\nproperty. The Board is of the view that the position taken by the management\ncouncil when not agreeing to the Applicant \u2019s proposals for retention of the works\nwas not unreasonable.\nPrayer 2(c):  \nThe application for a declaration pursuant to S 101(1)(c) read with S 101(4) of the \nAct  \n55. It was the submission of the Applicant that the MCST had refused or failed to\nexercise or perform its power duty or function under S 37(4) of the Act when the\nMCST did not authorise the works carried out by the Applicant which the\nApplicant contended were \u201cimprovements upon (not in) his lot \u201d. It was also the\nsubmission of the Applicant that when an improvement is made \u201cin respect of a\nlot\u201d it is an improvement \u201cupon\u201d  a lot.\n56. It is provided under SS 37(3) and 37(4) of the Act that, except when there is\nauthority from the management corporation, improvements in or upon a\nsubsidiary proprietor \u2019s lot that affects the appearance of a building is prohibited.\nThe management corporation can authorise improvements which affects the\nappearance of the building when the management corporation is satisfied it will\nnot detract from the appearance of any of the buildings comprised in the strata\ntitle plan or will be in keeping with the rest of the buildings. The provisions apply\nin connection with improvements \u201cin or upon \u201d a subsidiary proprietors lot i.e.\nwithin the lot. The Board does not agree with the submission of the Applicant that\nthe sections are applicable in connection with improvements that are not in a lot\nand that it will be sufficient when the improvements are \u201cin respect of \u201d a lot i.e.\nwhen improvements are made outside of the lot or on common property and they\nare made in respect of the subsidiary proprietor \u2019s lot the management\ncorporation can authorise the improvements. The extract from Strata Title in\nSingapore and Malaysia  (4th Edition LexisNexis 2012) cited by the Applicant viz17 STB 40 of 2015 \u2013 Ardmore Park Condominium  A subsidiary proprietor is also prohibited from effecting any other improvement in \nrespect of his lot for his benefit which affects the appearance of the building \nunless he is authorised by the management corporation to do so and upon such \nterms as it considers appropriate does not support the submission of the \nApplicant. The extract cannot be read as \u201c\u2026improvements that are not within a \nsubsidiary proprietor \u2019s lot e.g. on common property, that do not detract from the \nappearance of the building can be authorised by the management corporation \nwhen they are made in respect of the subsidiary proprietor \u2019s lot\u2026\u201d. If this is \ncorrect, subsidiary proprietors would be able to obtain exclusive use and \nenjoyment or special privileges over common property from the management \ncorporation without the need for a by-law which is required under S 33 of the Act. \n57. The Applicant in this case had also not made any request for the works to be\ncarried out before they were discovered by the MCST. As mentioned earlier\nproposals to retain the works were made after they were discovered by the\nMCST. The authorities cited by the Applicant that S 37(4) of the Act is applicable\nafter the works had been carried out viz MCST Plan 1378 v Chen Ee Yueh\nRachel [1993]3 SLR(R) 630  and MCST Plan 958 v Tay Soo Seng [1992]3\nSLR(R) 818 do not support the submission. In the Rachel Chen case the issue\nwas whether a mandatory order sought by the MCST requiring a subsidiary\nproprietor to remove windows which had been installed without the consent of\nthe management corporation should be granted. The order sought was not\ngranted after the court had considered precedents in connection with how the\nequitable jurisdiction of the court should be exercised with regard to the granting\nof a mandatory injunction. In the Tay Soo Seng case the issue was whether a\nglass partition of a shop unit in a building which a subsidiary proprietor had\nremoved and replaced with a metal roller shutter was common property. The\nmanagement corporation had contended that it was and sought an order from\nthe Board for the glass partition to be reinstated. It was the finding of the Board\nthat the glass partition was not common property as it was situated within the\nsubsidiary proprietor \u2019s lot. On appeal the court agreed with the finding of the\nBoard.18 STB 40 of 2015 \u2013 Ardmore Park Condominium  58. Whilst the subsidiary proprietor in the Tay Soo Seng case had submitted plans\nfor approval of removal of the glass panel and substitution of the roller shutter\nafter he had been asked by the management corporation to reinstate the glass\npanel, no order was made by the Board for the management corporation to\nconsent to the proposal since the glass panel was not common property.\n59. The Board is of the in view that SS 37(3) and (4) are not applicable because the\nworks were not carried out in or upon the Applicant \u2019s lot. There was no failure on\nthe part of the MCST to exercise powers under S 37(4).\nPrayer 2(d):     \nApplication for an Order under S 111(b) of the Act  \n60. S 111(b) of the Act is as follows:\nWhere pursuant to an application by a subsidiary proprietor, a Board considers\nthat a management corporation \u2026 (b) has unreasonably refused to authorise\nunder S 37(4) any improvement in or upon a lot which affect the appearance of\nany building \u2026the Board may make an order that the management corporation\nconsents to the proposal.\n61. It was the submission of the Applicant that the MCST had unreasonably refused\nto authorise proposals to effect improvements upon his lot.\n62. Whist the Applicant in this case has carried out works in the common areas and\non common property Work-1, Work-2 and Work-3 were not carried out in or upon\nhis lot. The MCST had never refused to authorise proposals to effect\nimprovements in or upon the Applicant \u2019s lot.\nConclusion \n63. In view of all of our findings, the Applicant is not entitled to any of the orders\nsought. There is no necessity for the Board to in this case determine if the Board\nhas the power to make a declaratory order. This will be done when the need\narises.19 STB 40 of 2015 \u2013 Ardmore Park Condominium  Decision of the Board: \n64. The applications in STB 40/2015 are dismissed.\n65.

This is an application by the Management Strata Title Plan No. 3727 (the \nApplicants) against the subsidiary proprietors of one of the lots in the development  \nknown as Helios Residences at Cairnhill Circle Singapore 229816. The Applicants \nare seeking for an order for the subsidiary proprietors to remove unauthorised/\nrenovation works carried out on common property.\n2. Ho Kok Wei (HKW) and Ng Xiang Rui (NXR) are the subsidiary proprietors in the \ndevelopment and their lot is at 15 Cairnhill Circle unit #XXX.\n3. On 4 August 2014, HKW submitted via email an Application of Alteration & \nAddition/Renovation/Tenancy Works. In the email HKW identified the application \nas an application for renovation works for our unit XXX. The particulars of works \nwere as follows: i) Metal screen to cover aircon compressor; ii) Landscape works;\niii)Carpentry works; iv) Painting works; v) Plumbing works. The application was \naccompanied by a cheque dated 30 July 2014 for $1000.STB 29 of 2015 \u2013 Helios Residences  Page 2 of 8 4.

A sketch was submitted by HKW on 7 August 2014 and he informed \u2026 we will\nsecure it on current raised aircon slab and side low wall ie not on the roof\nsurface \u2026On the same day AL informed \u201c\u2026 We have in principle no objection to\nthe proposed fitting works for the CU for your unit as per the attachment\u2026.  \n6. On 21 August 2014, AL via email inter alia informed HKW \u201c\u2026 we realised that your\nunit has done the following works to the common area:- 1) Put up glass panel all\naround the wall. 2) Dismantled our lights and has linked up the lighting to our\npower point 3) Installed a water point from our water source. Please be informed\nthat we have asked your contractor to stop the works at the common areas as\nthese works are deemed unauthorised at the common area\u2026 In the meantime\nplease hold all the works in the common areas. Thank you\u201d. Following the email, a\nletter was sent on 25 August 2014 by AL, and HKW was inter alia informed \u201c \u2026 it\nhas come to our attention that you have arranged for some renovation works to be\ncommenced at the common property outside your unit at the rooftop without prior\nnotification or approval by the MCST\u2026 we have requested your contractor to stop\nthe pending renovation works at the common area outside your unit at the roof\u2026if\nyou would like to pursue with the continuation of the renovation works at the\ncommon areas please let us have Drawing Plans and Illustrations for the Council\nto review and approve the intended works. We would also require the Certificate of\nCompliance and Single Line Drawing for our LEW to check and confirm that\nelectricity and water sources are from the unit. We can only give the approval for\nyour unit to proceed with the said M&E works upon their endorsement...\u201d  (In the\nSubmission By Respondents  (Form 18A) dated 30 June 2015 filed at the STB,\nthe Respondents inter alia informed that it was their understanding that they were\npermitted to proceed with the renovation as long as the request for drawing plans,\nillustrations and confirmation that the electricity and water sources were from their\nunit. It is not in dispute that electricity and water were not tapped from the\nApplicants\u2019 sources and were from the Respondents\u2019 unit.)\n7. On 24 September 2014, HKW was informed that the Applicants did not consent to\nthe renovations at the common property and subject to conditions set out in the\nApplicants\u2019 letter use of the common property on a temporary basis under a\nTemporary Occupation License could be considered.\n8. On 5 November 2014, HKW was, by letter, inter alia informed \u201c \u2026The Council has\ndeliberated the issues at length and unanimously takes the position that the said\nareas are common area and SP is not permitted to carry out any works or\nplacement of personal items on the common area, and the MC has no\nempowerment to give such entitlement. With that the MCST maintained the view\nthat these areas are common property and are hereby requesting you to make\narrangements to remove the items that were placed on the common areas to its\noriginal condition within one (1) month from the letter dated\u2026.\u201d  \n9. The Respondents did not comply with the request and the Applicants proceeded\nto file the application in this case for the Respondents to remove \u201c\u2026allSTB 29 of 2015 \u2013 Helios Residences  Page 3 of 8 unauthorised alteration/renovation works from the common property, specifically \nthe rooftop area outside the Respondent\u2019s unit and restores the Common Property \nto its original state. The unauthorised alteration/renovation works include but are \nnot limited to :-     \na. Glass panels affixed to rooftop walls;\nb. The removal and re placement of  lighting installed by development on the\nCommon Property;\nc. The tampering with the power point on the Common Property so as to provide\nelectricity for new lights installed on the Common Property;\nd. The installation of a water point on the common property to provide water to\nthe new water tap which was installed by the Respondents, at the Common\nProperty; and\ne. The installation of timber decking on the Common Property.\n10. It is the case for the Respondents that renovations had been carried out for the\npurpose of improving the overall condition and safety of the Common Property\nwhich was left in a dilapidated state due to lack of maintenance by the Applicants.\nIt was contended that before the renovation, the rooftop and walls were covered\nwith moss and algae which were unsightly and a health and safety hazard; there\nwas water ponding on the roof; the lights were often not lit and some were not in a\nserviceable condition; damaged and unserviceable wall lights had been replaced\nwith good quality lights; good quality all weather timber floor boards had been\ninstalled; water drainage improved to prevent water ponding; the installation of the\nlighting was connected to the Respondents\u2019 electrical source and paid for by the\nRespondents; the installation of the water supply was connected to the\nRespondents\u2019 water supply and water supplied and paid for by the Respondents\ni.e. the Respondents were not tapping electricity or drawing water that belonged to\nthe Applicants. Photos were exhibited to show the condition of the area before and\nafter the renovation works. It did not appear that there was any dispute that the\nareas were in a better condition after the renovation works. On the part of the\nApplicants, it had in the letter (dated 5 November 2014) requiring the Respondents\nto reinstate the areas to its original condition informed the Respondents that\n\u201c\u2026The Council has heard your views and concerns raised over the anticipated\nconstraints and maintenance to the said areas, however the MCST will do its\nutmost to upkeep and maintain the conditions of the said areas on a reasonable\nbasis\u2026\u2019\n11. The Board attempted to resolve the dispute between the Applicants and the\nRespondents but after two mediations it was indicated that the matter could not be\nresolved other than by way of an order from the Board after an arbitration hearing.\n12. The Respondents confirmed that it was not in dispute that the Respondents had\ncarried out unauthorised alterations/renovations at the common property at the\nrooftop area outside the Respondents\u2019 unit. The issue for determination by the\nBoard was\nShould the Board exercise its discretion under SS 101(1)(c) and 117(2) of the\nAct and order the Respondents to restore the common property to its\noriginal  stateSTB 29 of 2015 \u2013 Helios Residences  Page 4 of 8 13. Directions were given for the parties to file Written Submissions on or before 14 \nSeptember 2015 and Reply Submissions (if any) on or before 25 September 2015. \nThe arbitration hearing date was fixed for 14 October 2015.\n14. Before the arbitration hearing, the Board members considered that it would be \nuseful that we should visit and view the place where the unauthorised renovations/\nalterations had been carried out. In the course of our visit, we saw that the unit was \na penthouse unit with two levels and a roof terrace (total of three levels). Adjacent \nto the roof terrace is a flat roof. The flat roof is not a part of the Respondents\u2019 lot \nand it was on this flat roof that the unauthorised/renovations works had been \ncarried out. An air-con compressor and a \u201cmotor room\u201d (that services a lift running \nbetween the three levels of the Respondents\u2019 penthouse) are situated on the flat \nroof. The flat roof is separated from the roof terrace by a low wall with a door and is \nat a lower level than the roof terrace. The Respondents have raised floor level of \nthe flat roof by installing timber decking (GEFF Decking). The flat roof with the \ntimber decking is now flush with the roof terrace. In the Mechanical and Electrical \ndrawings for the estate, the flat roof has been marked as \u201cRC Flat Roof (No access \nFor Maintenance Only)\u201d\n15. Whilst there is no dispute that the flat roof is common property, the developer, \nwhen the building was being constructed, did not make any provision for subsidiary \nproprietors and occupiers of the estate to use it. Other than a service ladder affixed \nto the outside of the wall, it did not appear that the flat roof could be accessed by \nanyone other than the occupiers of unit #XXX. The service ladder would be used \nby the maintenance staff to access the flat roof for the purposes of maintaining the \ncommon property in a state of good and serviceable repair. In view of the fact that \nthat the flat roof is separated from the Respondents\u2019 roof terrace by a low wall with \na door, it would appear that it was not intended that the Respondents should not \nhave access to the flat roof. In fact, it would be necessary for the Respondents to \naccess the flat roof to maintain and attend to the air compressor and \u201cmotor room\u201d \nthat was on the flat roof.\nApplicants\u2019 Case: \n16. It was submitted that the order should be made because of\ni) the Respondents conduct viz disregard for the By-Laws; surreptitiously erecting\nthe unauthorised structures;\nii) the Respondents were using the flat roof as an extension of their roof terrace\nwhich the Applicants contend was never intended by the developer. In this\nconnection (in the Applicants\u2019 Written Submissions at paragraph 11 filed on 14\nSeptember 2015), the Applicants referred to an email from the developer (the\nemail was from a Mr Wee Liang Yew, writing on behalf of Winnervest\nInvestment Pte Ltd) and contended that the maximum allowable live load for\nthe flat roof was 0.65kN per square metre whilst the live load for the\nRespondents\u2019 unit including the roof terrace was 2kN per square metre. Whilst\nit was not specifically submitted, it appeared that the Applicants were implying\nthat the renovations/alterations had resulted in the maximum live load being\nexceeded and the stability and structural integrity of the flat roof had been\nadversely affected. Until receipt of the Written Submissions, it was never the\ncase for the Applicants when STB 29 of 2015 was filed, that an order should beSTB 29 of 2015 \u2013 Helios Residences     Page 5 of 8 \n made against the Respondents because the renovation s/alterations had \nresulted in the live load of the flat roof exceedin g the maximum allowable. After \nthe filing of the Applicants\u2019 Written Submissions, the Respondents, because \nthe Applicants had raised the issue of \u201cloading\u201d, e ngaged a professional \nengineer to prepare a report on the issue of loadin g and by way of a letter \ndated 21 September 2015, the Respondents applied fo r an extension of time to \nfile their Reply Submissions. After the Applicants had confirmed that they had \nno objections, the time for filing of the Reply Sub missions was extended to 19 \nOctober 2015 and the date for arbitration hearing f ixed for 14 October 2015 \nwas vacated and re-fixed to 6 November 2015. Er. Wo ng Yok Siong, a Civil \nand Structural Engineer with M/s RX Engineers, was appointed by the \nRespondents and he, after viewing the structural as -built drawings of the \nbuilding and conducting a structural study conclude d \u2026 Based on the study the \nadditional load due to the newly added Floor Deckin g and the Glass Panels are \nwell within the Design Live Load. In my opinion the  addition of such load will \nnot affect the stability and structural integrity o f the roof Terrace structures. \nWhen filing their Reply Submissions on 19 October 2 015, the Respondents \nannexed Er. Wong\u2019s report. By way of a letter dated  17 October 2015, the \nApplicants informed that they had received Er. Wong \u2019s report on 15 October \n2015 and were taking instructions on the contents of the Report a nd\u2026may \nhave to refer the same to the Developer of the Esta te and/or a qualified \nstructural engineer for their comments\u2026 An application was made by the \nApplicants for an extension of time to file their R eply Submissions by 2 \nNovember 2015. The Directions given by the Board in  connection with the filing \nof Reply Submissions was for these to be filed in r eply to the Written \nSubmissions. The Applicants were required to file R eply Submissions to \naddress issues raised in the Respondents\u2019 Written S ubmissions filed on 14 \nSeptember 2015 and the Board was of the view that t here was no reason why \nthe Applicants could not do this before 19 October 2015. The application to file \nReply Submissions by 2 November 2015 was rejected. When the Applicants \nfiled their Reply Submissions on 20 October 2015, i t was submitted that the \nApplicants \u201c\u2026 have not been afforded the right to be fully heard on the \nsubstantive conclusions reached by the Respondent\u2019s  Professional \nEngineer\u2026.\u201d  It will be in order to repeat that Er. Wong\u2019s repo rt was filed by the \nRespondents in reply to an issue raised by the Appl icants in the Applicants\u2019 \nWritten Submissions filed on 14 September 2015. The  Board, when \nconsidering the application in the Applicants\u2019 lett er dated 17 October 2015, was \nnot dealing with an application for time to file a Reply to the Reply Submissions \nfiled on 19 October 2015. \n17. In support of their application, the Applicants  referred the Board to a number of \nauthorities: \n- Tay Tuan Kiat and another v Pritam Singh Brar [19 85-1986] SLR(R)763; \n- Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 1378 v Chen Ee Yueh Rachel \n [1993]3SLR(R)630;  \n- Choo Kok Lin and Another v Management Corporation  Strata Title Plan No  \n 2405 [2005] 4SLR(R)175;  \n- Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 681 v  Tan Yew Huat [2015] \n SGDC118;  STB 29 of 2015 \u2013 Helios Residences     Page 6 of 8 \n - Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 2570 v Ng Khai Chuan and \n Another [2006] SGDC 176;  \n- Management Corporation Strata title Plan No 2605 v Abdul Rahman Rais \n Chong@ Chong Ngak Koon an Another [2013] SGDC 328;  and  \n- Management Corporation Strata title Plan No 1786 v Huang Hsiang Shui [2006] \n SGDC 20) with regard to the applicable law \nRespondents\u2019 Case: \n18. The submission of the Respondents was that the order should not be made \nbecause \u201c\u2026there will be a great detriment to the Respondent s and no \ncorresponding benefit to the Applicants or members of the entire property if the \nSTB is to decide that the Renovation Works be remov ed\u2026.\u201d. \n19. The cases referred to by the Applicants were ci ted by the Respondents in support \nof their opposition to an order being made against them. \n20. The Respondents also submitted that there was n othing to support the Applicants\u2019 \nallegation that they had surreptitiously erected un authorised structures and had \nnever claimed a right to use the flat roof as an ex tended roof terrace. \nDecision of the Board: \n21. There is no ambiguity with regard to the law in  connection with granting a \nmandatory injunction to redress a breach of a negat ive covenant in situations \nwhere the breach has already occurred and it will n ot be necessary to deal with all \nthe cases cited by the Applicants and Respondents.   \n22. It will be sufficient to refer to Management Co rporation Strata Title Plan No 1378 v \nChen Ee Yueh Rachel [1993]3SLR(R) 630. In the Rache l Chen case, the \nsubsidiary proprietor had replaced metal grills tha t enclosed her balcony with \nsliding windows without first obtaining written app roval from the management \ncorporation that was required under the by-laws. Th e management corporation \napplied for a mandatory injunction requiring her to  remove what she had installed \nand restore the external wall of the building to it s original state. Chao Hick Tin J \n(as he then was) when considering if the order shou ld be made, considered the \ncase law cited by the subsidiary proprietor and not ed that the law laid down was \nthat generally a mandatory injunction will not be issued  unless very serious \ndamage will ensue from withholding an injunction.  Reference was then made to \nthe case of Proprietors \u2013 Strata Plan No 464 v Obor n [1975] 2CCH Strata Title \nLaw and Practice 50 at 201 decided by Holland J. Th e judge in that case after \nreviewing the authorities in connection with the gr anting of a mandatory injunction \nsaid  \n The general principle to be extracted from these c ases is that the court will grant a \n mandatory injunction to redress a breach of a nega tive covenant which is already \n accomplished, unless; \n(a) the plaintiff\u2019s own conduct will make it unjust  to do so;  \n  or STB 29 of 2015 \u2013 Helios Residences     Page 7 of 8 \n (b) the breach is trivial or has caused no damage o r no appreciable damage to \nthe plaintiff and a mandatory injunction would impo se substantial hardship \non the defendant with no counterbalancing benefit t o the plaintiff \n23. In Rachel Chen case, the judge decided not to e xercise his discretion and order \nthe subsidiary proprietor to remove the sliding win dows because in the \ncircumstances of the case the order would cause har dship without any real \ncorresponding benefit to the management corporation . When deciding as he did, \nthe judge was conscious of the fact that matters af fecting common property are, \nunder the Act, entrusted to the management corporat ion and individual proprietors \ncannot be allowed to dictate to the management corp oration because \nmanagement corporation would then be unable to disc harge their functions and \nchaos would be the result. \n24. In the circumstances of the case at hand, the B oard was conscious that subsidiary \nproprietors should not be allowed to spurn and unde rmine the authority of the \nmanagement corporation. Subsidiary proprietors who are of the view that the \ncondition of the common property is not satisfactor y cannot be allowed to \nunilaterally proceed to carry out works on the comm on property in order that the \ncondition will become, in their view, satisfactory.  In determining whether the order \nprayed for should be granted in this case, the Boar d, in order that a just and fair \nresult should be produced considered all the circum stances in this case. \n25. In this case, the Respondents had submitted an application for renovation works \nincluding Landscape works; Carpentry works; Painting works; a nd Plumbing works \nwithout referring to the fact that these works woul d be carried out on common \nproperty. \n26. Before the works were completed, they were info rmed to stop the works but \ncontinued until the works were completed. The manag ement corporation when \nasking them to stop the works did so because the ma nagement corporation had \nnot been notified and had not given approval for th e works. Other than the \nRespondents and the maintenance staff in the estate , the common property where \nthe works were carried out is not visible and acces sible to anyone. From the \nMechanical and Electrical drawing of the estate ( No Access For Maintenance \nOnly), it is clear that this area of the common property w as not common property \nthat was to be accessed and enjoyed by all the subs idiary proprietors in the \nestate.  \n27. In the eyes of the Respondents, the condition o f the common property which was \nadjacent to their roof terrace was unsatisfactory a nd they proceeded to rectify this. \nAs noted earlier, an application for renovation wor ks was submitted without any \nreference to the fact that works would be carried o ut on common property. \n \n28. When carrying out the works, no damage had been  caused to the property and to \nthe management corporation. There was in fact a ben efit in that the condition had \nbeen enhanced. \n29. It would be in order to find that after improvi ng the condition, the Respondents \naccessed, utilised and enjoyed the improvements. Th ey were not in breach of any STB 29 of 2015 \u2013 Helios Residences  Page 8 of 8 prohibitions or by-laws when they utilised and enjoyed the improved condition of \nthe common property. \n30. An order to remove would cause substantial hardship (time and money would\nhave to be expended to remove an enhancement) with no counterbalancing\nbenefit to the management corporation. An order to remove would result in\nenhancements being erased and the area would revert to the state that it was in\nbefore the enhancements. Such an order would be of no benefit to anyone and\nwould not be in the interest of the estate.  Accordingly, the Board is of the view\nthat it will not be in order for the Board to exercise its discretion in favour of the\nApplicants.\n31. The application is accordingly not granted. We are of the view that it will not be in\norder to award costs to the Respondents and accordingly will make no order as to\ncosts.\nDated this 23rd day of November 2015 \n \nMR REMEDIOS F.G \nDeputy President \nMR LAI HUEN POH \nMember \nMR CHAN EWE JIN \nMember  "

Applicant(s) \nAnd  \nLam Wai Kong Davy \n   ... Respondent\nCoram:   Mr. Alfonso Ang  (President ) \n Mrs. Tan Sook Yee (Member)  \n  Dr. Richard Tan Han Shing  (Member)  \nCounsel :  Ms. Lim Poh Choo (M/s Alan Shankar)  for the Applicants  \nRespondent:  Mr. Lam Wai Kong Davy (In -Person)  2 \nSTB 13 OF 2015 - PALMWOODS GROUNDS OF DECISION \n1. The Applicants, Ho Yew Choong, Victor and Khew Cai Jun are the subsidiary proprietors\nof 450 Upper Changi Road, #XXX, Palmwoods (the \u201cPremises\u201d) and the Respondent, Lam  \nWai Kong, Davy is the subsidiary proprietor of 450 Upper Changi Road, # XXX, Palmwoods. \nThe Applicants\u2019 lot is situated immediately below the Respondent\u2019s.\nBACKGROUND \n2. Sometime in July 2015, the Applicants observed brown specks in the ceilings of one the\nbedrooms and toilet of the Premises. Following a Management Corporation Strata Plan No.\n2447 \u2019s (\u201cMCST \u201d) inspection, the MCST wrote to the Respondent on 18 July 2015,\ninforming him of  the Applicants\u2019 complaint of leakage problem which they alleged\noriginated from the Respondent\u2019s  toilet flooring.\n3. By way of an email dated 8 August 2015 , the 2nd Applicant brought to the Respondent\u2019s\nattention that a contractor appointed by the MCST assessed the inter-floor water leakage\nproblem and recommended waterproofing of the Respondent\u2019s toilet in order to rectify the\nleak.\n4. On 12 August 2015, the Respondent replied by way of an email, rejecting the\nrecommendation of the MCST\u2019s contractor, on the basis that the alleged water damage was\nattribut ed to a concealed pipe in his lot which he had since rectified.\n5. On 28  August 2015, the Applicants observed further instances of water damage to their\nPremises .\n6. As the Applicants alleged that the Respondent had failed to remedy the water seepage\nproblem, they filed an application under section 101(8) of the Building Maintenance and\nStrata Management Act (Cap. 30C) (BMSMA).3 \nSTB 13 OF 2015 - PALMWOODS 7. The Applicants sought the following orders against the Respondent:-\n1) Repair and rectification of inter-floor water seepage by repairing the water\nproofing membrane in the Respondent\u2019s unit .\n2) Repainting of the walls and ceiling in the bedroom and common toilet of the\nApplicant\u2019s unit that have sustained water damage from inter-floor seepage.\n3)Replacement of the cornices in the bedroom of the Applicant\u2019s unit that have\nsustained water damage from inter-floor seepage.\n4)Reimbursement the Applicant\u2019s STB fees and any and all cost of legal counsel and\nlegal proceedings incurred until resolution of this case . \u201d\n8. Both Applicants testified at the hearing.  The Respondent gave evidence, in addition to his\nexpert witness, Mr Jimmy Oh, an operator of a licensed plumbing company.\nAPPLICANTS\u2019 CASE  \n9. Ho Yew Choong Victor, (AW1) in paragraph 7 of his Affidavit of Evidence in Chief (AEIC)\nsaid that he first noticed brown specks in the ceiling of their daughter\u2019s playroom (i.e. the\nbedroom) about two weeks before 12 July 2014.  \u201cThe brown specks were located at the\ncornices and along the edge which connects to the common bathroom of the Premises and\nalso in the false ceiling of the adjacent common bathroom/toilet. \u201d\n10. On 12 July 2014, the Applicants complained of drilling noises from the Respondent\u2019s lot ,\nand observed the appearance of \u201cmore brown specks and some of the specks had enlarged\u201d.\nThis was confirmed in paragraphs 8 and 9 of AW1\u2019s AEIC where in he stated that following\nhis complaint, a security guard investigated and informed him that the drilling was the\nRespondent\u2019s act of ins talling a water-heater.\u201c4 \nSTB 13 OF 2015 - PALMWOODS 11. The leakage experienced by the Applicants progressed into \u201ca large water bubble on the\nwall just below the brown stains and various dark patches on the ceiling around the cornice \u201d\n(\u201cthe Damages\u201d), a perceived result of the Respondent\u2019s installation of the water -heater\ncompromising the integrity of the Respondent\u2019s common bathroom.\n12. The aggravation of the damage led the Applicants raising  the issue with the Property Officer\nof the MSCT, one Mr. Hardeep, who on 14 July 2014 inspected the Damages at the\nApplicants \u2019 lot and duly informed AW1 that a contractor would be called in to assess the\nDamages and provide the former with a quotation for the rectification works.\n13. On 17 July 2014, a contractor appointed by the MCST, one Mr. Kenny, came to the Premises\nto assess the Damages. Mr. Kenny was of the view that the Damages were \u201cthe result of\nwater seepage\u201d  and recommended that the Respondent\u2019s common bathroom \u201cshould be re-\nwaterproofed \u201d. This was confirmed in an email sent by the 2nd Applicant to the Respondent\ndated 8 August 2015, exhibited at TAB A, VH 3 of AW1\u2019s AEIC .\n14. The 1st Applicant claimed that Mr. Kenny opined that the Respondent was not likely to agree\nto waterproofing, hence proposed the alternative \u201cto carry out pressure grouting \u201d from the\nPremises (paragraphs 12 and 13 of AW1\u2019s  AEIC).\n15. It was submitted by the 1st Applicant that the following day, 18 July 2014, Mr Hardeep and\nthe Property Manager, one Mr Zamri, went to the Premises and photographed the Damages.\nMr Zamri then informed the 1st Applicant that pressure grouting would stop the leakage for\n1-2 years, whilst re-waterproofing would last for an approximate 15 years (paragraph 14 of\nAW1\u2019s AEIC) . \n16. The 1st Applicant exhibited copy of an MCST letter dated 18 July 2014 wherein the MCST\nnotified the Respondent of the Applicants\u2019 inter -floor water seepage complaints, the\nDamages, and probable cause (TAB A, VH 3 of his AEIC). In the same letter, the\nRespondent was referred to photograph ic evidence of the water seepage and  the statutory5 \nSTB 13 OF 2015 - PALMWOODS presumption of liability and the Applicants appealed for his co-operation in resolving the \nproblem. \n17. Meanwhile, the Respondent verbally informed Khew Cai Jun (AW2) that he had \u201cbought\nexternal pipes to drain the excess water \u201d from his common bathroom, and that no further\nleakage problem should arise. Thereafter, the Applicants reported that the Respondent\ndeclined contact in the following weeks to discuss the matter.\n18. The Applicants are of the view that the Respondent should solely bear the costs of repairs in\naccordance with the provisions of the BMSMA, and consequently objected to the\nRespondent\u2019s proposed cost -sharing arrangements.\n19. The Respondent contacted AW1 on 4 May 2015 and informed AW1 that he had arranged\nfor two \u201cspecialists \u201d to inspect the Damages and requested that the Premises be made\naccessible to them. The Applicants submitted that this was complied with despite the short\nnotice.\n20. AW1 alleged that the first \u201cspecialist\u201d, whom AW1 believed to be the Respondent\u2019s plumber,\ninformed the Respondent in AW1\u2019s presence  that the leak was not serious, whilst the second\n\u201cspecialist \u201d was heard to have reported that the leak was a result of defective waterproofing\n(paragraphs 32 and 33 of AW1\u2019s AEIC) .\n21. AW1 stated in paragraph 34 of his AEIC that the Respondent did not submit any reports with\nregard to the conclusion of the inspections.\n22. The Applicants exhibited evidence (at TAB A, VH 7 of AW1\u2019s AEIC)  of a year-long\nunresolved water leakage problem in the Premises, and formation of stalactites.\n23. The Applicants reported that the water-marks and water stains have grown, coupled with the\npersistent presence of the water bubble. The Applicants further claimed that the stains on the6 \nSTB 13 OF 2015 - PALMWOODS ceiling boards would have worsened had they not placed a basin to collect the dripping water \npercolating from the Respondent\u2019s upper floor lot.  \nRESPONDENT\u2019S CASE  \n24. Lam Wai Kong, Davy (RW1) agreed that there was an occurrence of inter-floor leakage. He,\nhowever, contended that the source and cause stemmed from a defective concealed pipe\nserving his lot. The Respondent submitted that he had discharged his duty accordingly by\nshutting off the concealed pipes and installing exposed pipes.\n25. The Respondent also disputed the extent of the damage caused in the Premises and the\nmethodology to rectify the defect.\n26. The Respondent explained that during the week-long rectification works, large amounts of\nwater were discharged  due to a valve that was difficult to shut. In respect of the rectification\ncarried out, the Respondent referred to copies of photographs (at Exhibit \u2013 Photos of his\nAEIC) exhibiting the completed repairs.\n27. The Respondent said that following the completion of rectification works in connection with\nthe alleged defective pipe, water leakage in the Premises should have ceased , and\naccordingly, the Applicants had no grounds for complaint.\n28. The Respondent\u2019s case is that t he Applicants were arguably misconceived to specify\nwaterproofing as the sole reasonable remedy.\n29. In the Respondent\u2019s evidence, t he Applicants complained that the water leakage caused\ndiscolouration of the cornices in an adjacent bathroom. The Respondent submitted that he\nhad observed \u201cthose spots of discolouration on the cornice\u2026 (to be) very minor\u201d , and argued\nthat they are a natural consequence of fair wear and tear (paragraph 4 of his AEIC).7 \nSTB 13 OF 2015 - PALMWOODS 30. T he Respondent\u2019s \u201c expert witness \u201d, Mr. Jimmy Oh (RW2), an experienced plumber,\ntestified that after inspecting the Respondent\u2019s premises, he saw signs of possible previous\nseepage which had dried up completely.\n31. RW2\u2019s  conclusion after the inspection was as follows:-\n\u201cI reported to Mr Lam that the situation is minor, and that the only repair needed is to \nremove the dried up protrusions caused by the seepage, and make good the cornice and wall \nby painting over them .\u201d \n32. RW2 said that on 20 July 2015, he was prepared to instruct his workers to carry out such\nnecessary remedial work. However, the Applicants denied access to their lot.\n33. In addition to RW2\u2019s findings, t he Respondent contended at paragraph 9 of his AEIC that\ncontrary to what the Applicants claimed of further water damage , these alleged spots of\nconcern were minor stains  which had not visibly worsened from their initial state. The\nRespondent\u2019s primary argument was that the observations of his expert and himself were\ntestament to the leakage problem being resolved following the concealed pipe replacement\nwith exposed pipes.\n34. The Respondent claimed that the extent of the Applicants\u2019 repair requests were excessive.\n35. The Respondent exhibited his proposal to the Applicants, evidenced by an email to the\nApplicants\u2019 Counsel (Alan Shankar & Lim LLC  (ASL) ) dated 12 July 2015. In this email he\nproposed a fully independent surveyor or licensed plumbing contractor appointed by a third\nparty to review and advise on the leakage problem, with a view towards an amicable\nsettlement. Relevant portions of the email are stated as follows :\nFrom the evidence (at Exhibit \u2013 Email) of the Respondent \u2019s AEIC, t he Respondent proposed \ninter alia,: 8 \nSTB 13 OF 2015 - PALMWOODS \u201cWe propose the appointment of an independently appointed surveyor for this purpose on a \nshared basis and are therefore ready on sharing the cost \u2026 (notwithstanding that a licensed \nplumbing contractor can suffic e).\u201d  \n36. The Respondent\u2019s  offer of 12 July 2015 was rejected outright by the Applicants on 16 July\n2015. Their counsel replied:\n\u201c\u2026 Your proposal therein is unacceptable to our clients. \nFurther, be informed that our clients\u2019 proposal for amicable settlement  vide our letter dated \n25 June 2015 is withdrawn. \n\u2026 Our clients will proceed as per the direction of the Strata Title Board given on 29 June \n2015. We will inform you when our clients\u2019 AEICs are ready for exchange.\u201d      \nBOARD\u2019S FINDINGS  \n37. In the course of hearing the evidence, it was clear to the Board that the relationship between\nthe Applicants and the Respondent was acrimonious. The Board will disregard their personal\nissues as these are matters for another forum and will not make any comment on those\nmatters.\n38. The Board will confine the findings solely to matters pertaining to issues connected with the\napplication.\n39. The Board is mindful of the following:\ni. The occurrence of the inter-floor leak emanat ed from the common bathroom of the\nRespondent\u2019s upper floor lot to the bedroom and common toilets of the Applicants\u2019\nlower floor lot.9 \nSTB 13 OF 2015 - PALMWOODS ii. The Respondent conceded that the leakage problem in the Applicant s\u2019 lot was due to\na defect within his own lot. T he thrust of the Respondent\u2019s argument , however, was\nthat the source of the leaks had been rectified and hence the application was\nunreasonable. However, he alluded to the fact that if any repair is required, there were\noptions besides changing the water membrane.\niii. The Respondent argued that the defects were not so serious as to cause the extent of\nthe Applicants\u2019 alleged damages to his Premises.  In particular, there was no need to\nchange the entire cornices. That required replacement of the entire cornices in the\nbedroom.\niv. As the Respondent has agreed to paint the walls and ceiling in the bedroom and\ncommon toilet, there is no need  for the Board to make a finding on this.\nv. There are stalactites in the inter floor area. The Respondent\u2019s \u201cexpert witness\u2019,  (RW2)\na plumber of over 20 years\u2019 standing testified that he did could not touch the stalactite\nbut he could see from a distance o f a few feet that it was \u2018dry\u2019 and that it has not\nincreased in size. The Board is of the view that this evidence is insufficient and the\nRespondent has not proved that there is no more leak.\nBOARD\u2019S DECISION / ORDER  \n40. The Board makes the following order addressing specifically what the Applicants had\n\u201cpleaded\u201d in their application  and will deal with each of the specific pray ers set out in the\napplication.\n41. Section D (a) 1. Repair and rectification of inter-floor seepage by repairing the water\nproofing membrane in the Respondent\u2019s unit\n(i) The duty of the Respondent is to ensure that there is no water leakage emanating from\nhis premises to that of the Applicants. The methodology as to how this can be done10 \nSTB 13 OF 2015 - PALMWOODS  varies. The Respondent could , in the extreme, if he so wishes convert the entire toilet \ninto a study room to prevent any water leakage .  Th is could solve the problem. \nHowever, t here is no suggestion that he will do so.  \n \n(ii) The Respondent \u2019s suggestion  that both parties share the costs of \u201can independent \nsurvey or appointed by a third party to review the issue \u201d had been turned down  by the \nApplicants.  \n \n(iii) The Applicants , in their submission s have now  abandoned their prayer that the \nRespondent  change the water membrane.  They now seek an order that their  surveyor \naccess the Respondent \u2019s unit to conduct an investigation and recommend a solution to \narrest the leakage and carry out such remedial actions as m ay be recommended at his \ncost.  \n \n(iv) The Board would ordinarily allow the Respondent to engage a plumber t o resolve the \nproblem.  It is clear to us that the Respondent\u2019 s plumber had not been able to d o so or \nwas only partially successful.  \n \n(v) We do not accept that the Applicant s can demand that the Respondent change the water \nproofing membrane as the source and c ause of the leak have  not been identified. The \nApplicants cannot insist that the water membrane be repaired  or changed when there \nare other methods to plug the source of leak such as grouting. The cost of grouting is  \nabout one tenth the price of repair  or change of water membrane. Both of these methods \nare recognized and acceptable methods in the building industry and accepted by the  \nBuilding and Construction Authority . \n \n(vi) The Board does not accept the Applicant s\u2019 submission that  the Respondent should be \ncomp elled to engage a  surveyor of  the Applicants\u2019 choice to conduct a survey and \nrecommend a solution.   The Board also notes that this suggestion was only brought up \nat the Applicants\u2019 submission.  \n 11 \nSTB 13 OF 2015 - PALMWOODS  (vii) Neither party has been able to conclusively ascertain the cause(s) of the leak and hence \nwe are no clearer as to how the damage can be stopped. Compelling the Respondent \nto change the water membrane when the cause of the leak has not been ascertained \nwould be meaningless a nd may well be an unnecessarily expensive exercise. The cause \nof the leak has to be determined and the remedy should be recommended by an expert \nin this field. The Board therefore will not grant the application as prayed. The Board  \norders that the Responde nt engage his own surveyor to conduct a survey to  ascertain \nthe cause of the water seepage and conduct such repairs as may be recommended by \nthe surveyor within six weeks from  the date of this order. The costs  of the survey  and \nrectification are to be borne by the Respondent.  \n \n42. Section D (a) (2) . Repainting of the walls and ceiling in the bedroom and common toilet of \nthe Applicant s\u2019 unit that have sustained water damaged from inter -floor seepage  \n \nAs the Respondent has agreed to paint all the w alls instead of only the affected area s, the \nBoard orders that the Respondent paint all the walls and ceiling of the bedroom of the \nApplicants\u2019 unit six weeks from the date of this order . \n \n43. Section D (a) (3) .  Replacement of the cornices in the bedroom of the Applicant s\u2019 unit that \nhave sustained water damage from inter -floor seepage  \n \nThe Board finds and agrees with the Respondent that the extent of the damage  to the cornices \nwas not such that it required the entire cornices be replaced. It accordingly orders that the \nRespondent repair and repaint the affected parts of the cornices within six weeks  from the \ndate of this order.  \n \n44. Section D (a) 4. Reimbursement the Applicant s\u2019 ST B fee and any and all cost s of legal \ncounsel and legal proceedings incurred until resolution of this case,  \n \n45. The Board will deal with the issue of costs.  \n 12 \nSTB 13 OF 2015 - PALMWOODS (i) At the first day of hearing on 24 August 2015, it was brought to the Board\u2019s attention\nthat the Applicants had failed and/or refused to exchange the ir affidavits of evidence\nin chief with the Respondent notwithstanding directions being given by the Board. As\nthe Respondent did not have the Applicants\u2019 affidavit s on the day of the hearing, he\nwas in no position to prepare his case and cross-examine the Applicants. It was only\nwhen the Board ordered that the Respondent be given copies of the Applicants\u2019\naffidavits of evidence in chief, were they made available to the Respondent. The\nhearing which was fixed for 2 days was vacated and the Board reserved the issue of\ncosts.\n(ii) The Board finds that the conduct of the Applicants\u2019 counsel, in refusing the\nRespondent\u2019s reasonable  request as to the mode of exchange of affidavits, unwarranted.\nThey made no effort at all to attempt to serve the affidavits. For the costs thrown away\nwe order that the Applicants pay costs fixed at $1,0 00.\n(iii) As regards costs for the hearing, the Board is mindful that the Applicants did partially\nsucceed in their prayers . The Board rejects the Applicants\u2019 submission that they are\nentitled to \u201ccosts on an indemnity basis\u201d.  There is no basis for an award of costs on\nthat basis.13 \nSTB 13 OF 2015 - PALMWOODS (iv) Bearing in mind that only one of the 3 prayers was granted as drafted, we do not allow\nthe Applicants \u2019 costs in full and accordingly award a sum of $1,500 (being half costs\nof $3,000) to the Applicants.\nDated this 15th day of October 2015. \nMR ALFONSO ANG \nPresident \nMRS TAN SOOK YEE \n Member \nDR RICHARD TAN HAN SHING \nMember "

The Respondent then forwarded the Applicant,s request to\nthe Development's Licensed Electrical Worker (LEW), t\\,{r Ng Hai Hock (,,Mr Ng,,) of NHH\nConsultants, who requesled for additional documents.\nIvlr Ng also signed off on two CS/s Forms on 7 June 2012, stating that he had ,checked\nthe loading ol the electrical installation of the [Applicant's] load requiroment, and\nconfirmed that lhe Applicant's request 'can be catered for from the rising/horizontal\nmains system/main switchboard of the building/complex, and the total approved load to\nthe eniire building/complex will not be exceeded'.\nOn 18 June 2012, NHH Consultants issued a lelter to the Respondent stating that they\nhad 'no objection' lo the Applicant upgrading the Units' electricity suppty lrom 63 Ampere\nSingle Phase to 100 Ampere Three Phase.\nSubsequently, by an omail daled 27 June 2012, the Respondent informed the Applicant\nthat lhey were unable to accede to her request to an upgrade of the electricity supply to\nher Units, as doing so would result in there not being 'any more spare for future use by\nthe management for common aroa upgrading'.3\n4\n5\n6\n2STB 92 OF 2014 -WATERMARK ROBERTSON QUAYGROUNDS OF DECISION\n#XXX #XXX7On 27 June 2012, NHH Consultants issued another report confirming that they had no\nobjections to the Applicant's request for the upgrading of the Units' electricity supply to\n80 Ampore Three Phase, The report also stated that there would be another 'about 60A\nthree phase still available for future upgrading' but the approval shall be subject to the\nManagement Council's approval.\nOn 2 July 2012, NHH Consultants issued a third report, but this time, they stated that\nthey had no objections to the Applicant's request to upgrade unit  to 63 Ampere\nThree Phase and unit  to 80 Ampere Three Phase. The reporl again stated that\nthere would be another'about 60A three phase still available for luture upgrading, but\nthe approval shall be subject to the Management Council's approval.\nHowever, the Respondont later informed the Applicant by a letter dated 6 July 2012 that\nthe Management Council had rejected her application aflor consideration of the 'limlted\nsparg eloclrical capacity for the development', as the Management Corporation had to\n'rosorye the spare power supply for ,ulure common areas upgrading / improvement\nworks'.\nThe Applicant's solicitors wrote to the Respondent's solicitors re-stating the Applicant,s\nrequesl, but these were rejected both times.\nConsequenlly, the Applicant applied to lhe Board seeking an order that the Respondenl\nallow the Applicanl's request to carry out upgrading of the electricity supply to the Units\nto 100 Ampere Three Phase.\n12. The Applicant submits that there four main issues lor the Board's consideration:\na. Whether electricity supply is pan of lhe common property;\nb. Whether consent is required for the Applicant's requosted upgrade;\nc. Whether this is a matter whlch requires a decision to be made at a general\nmeeting of the Management Corporation; and\nd. Whether tho Bsspondenfs refusal to consent to the Applicant's requested\nupgrade is unreasonable.I\n10\n11\n3 STB 92 OF 2014 -WATERMAR( ROBERTSON QUAY8.\n#XXX#XXX13. The Respondent submits that the application should be dismissed for the following\nreasons\na. There is insufficient electricity supply in the Development to meet the Applicant,s\nrequested upgrade;\nb. The unutilized electricity supply forms part of common property;\nc. The Respondent is not in a position to approve the Applicant's request as such\napproval would be tantamount to granting the Applicant exclusive use and\nenjoyment or special privileges in respect of the common property;\nd. The Board has no jurisdiction to make an order under Section 101(1Xc) Building\nMaintenance and Strata Management Act CBNTSrMA) by virtue of Section 101(6)\nBMSMA; and\ne. The Bespondenfs refusal was not unreasonable pursuant to Section 111\nBMSMA.\nCONSIDERATIONS\n14.In considering whether the Respondent had improperly refused the Applicanfs requost,\nthe following ars relevant:\nWhether the electricity supply constilutes common property;\nWhether the Respondents consent is required for lhe Applicanl's request and/or\nwhether this is a matter which requires a decision to be mado at a genoral\nmeeting of the Managemenl Corporation; and\nWhether there is sutticient spare electrical capacity for the Applicant to carry out\nthe upgrading of the Units' electricity supply.b\nc\n15.APPLICANT'S CASE\nWhether theelectricitv suoolv conslitules'co on Drooertv'\nThe Applicant submitted that the olectricity supply dld not constitute ,common property,\nof the Development. ln support of this, it was submitted thal the electricity is paid lor by\nlhe respeclive subsidiary proprietors to the electricity provider. Nevertheless, the\n4STB 92 OF 2014_ WATERMAR( ROBERTSON QUAYWhetherApplicant conceded that the electricity would have to pass through switchboards,\nmeters, cables and pipes, all of which are part of the common property.\nthe BesDondent can aoorove theAoicant's reouest and/or whether this is a matter\nwhich reouires a decision to be made at a oeI meetino of the l/anaoem ent Corooration\n18.\n19.\n20\n21.It followed that the Applicant would have to satisfy Section 3A BMSMA, namely that a\nraquisite resolution has to be achieved at a general meeling of the Development.\nThe Respondent funher contended that even if the Respondent could approve the\nApplicant's request, the Applicant required a special resolution to procure an upgrade of\nthe capacity of DB-Shop-1 / DB-Shop-z.\nThe Rospondont contends that as the unutilized electricity supply is common property,\nthe Board does not have jurisdiction to make an order under Section 101(l)(c) BMSIvIA\nby virtue of Seclion 101(6) BITISMA.\nThe Applicant on the other hand acknowledged that given the fact that the electrical\nsupply has to pass through the switchboards, cables and conduits which form pan of\ncommon property, the Applicant requirird the Respondenfs consent to upgrade her\nelectricity supply. The Applicanl argued that pursuant to Section 29(1) BMSMA, ihe\nRespondent had a duty to 'control, manage and administer the common property for the\nbenefit of all the subsidiary proprietors...'. lt was luflher contended that Section 101(1)\nBI\\ISI\\/A provided that the Board may make an order for lhe setflemenl of a dispute with\n5STB 92 OF 2014 _WATERMARK ROBERTSON QUAY16. The Respondent argued that the unutilized electricity supply clearly lell within the\ndefinition ol'common prope(y' in Section 2(1) of the BMSMA, as it was not comprised in\nany lot or proposed lot and was used or capable of being used or enjoyed by occupiers\nof two or more lots or proposed lots.\n17. The Respondent contends that the Respondent would not be in a position to approve the\nApplicant's request if the unutilized electricity supply is deemed to be common properly,\nas such approval would be tantamount to granling the Applicant exclusive use and\nenjoyment or special privileges in respect o, the common property.respect to the exercise or performance of, or the failure to discharge its duty under\nSection 29(1) BMSMA.\ner there is suffici acttor uested\nThe Applicant conlends lhat there is sufficient spare electrical capacity for an upgrade of\nthe electricity supply to the Units to 100 Ampere Three Phase. The Respondent dlsputes\nthis, and is of the view that there is simply no spare electrical capacity in the\nDevelopment.\nBoth parties called witnesses to give evidence in this regard. We consider the evidence\nbelow.\nBOARD'S VIEWS AND DECISION\nWhether electricitv sunolv constituted Dart of the 'mon propertv' of the Develooment23\n24,\nzc.\n26.The Board has been invited by the Respondent to make the holding that electricity\nsupply lo the Development constilutes 'common property, as defined by the BMSIVIA.\nCertain legal consequences will flow if the unused electricity supply is regarded as\n'common property. ln order for the Respondent lo succeed ln this respect, the\nRespondent has to cross two legal hurdles. First, the Respondent must establish that\nthe unused electricity supply to the Development is, as a malter of law, a property right.\nSecond, even if unused electricity supply is a proporty right, this right must be fall within\nthe definition of 'common property' as defined by the BMSMA.\nThe first issue whether unused electricity supply to the Development is a property right is\nan extremely tricky question. As Gray and Gray in E emenfs of Land Law, (OUp, 2009),\npara 1.5.1 observed '[flew concepts are quite so fragile, so elusive and so frequenfly\nmisused as the notion of property.'\nThe starting poinl for the definition of property is the case ot National provincial Bank v\nAinswoih [1S65J AC 1175, 1247 - 1248 where Lord Wilberforce said (cited with\napproval by the Court ot Appeal in Toh Eng Lan v Foong Fook yue and another appeal\n[1 ee8] 3 SLR(R) 8s3):\n6STB 92 OF 2014 _WATERMARK ROBERTSON QUAY27.\n29(i)\n(ii)\n(iii)\"B6fore a right or an interest can be admitted into the category of property, or of a\nright affecting property, it must be definabte, identifiable by third parties, capable in\nils nature of assumption by third parties and have some degree of permanence or\nstability.\"\nHowever, it must be not6d that Ainsworlh has coms under trenchant judicial and\nacademic crilicism (see for example Gray, 'Property in Thin Aif (i991) 50 Cambridge LJ\n252 at p 292-293 (this article has been cited by Chan Seng Onn J in Lee Ken Meng v\nCintamani Frank 120151SGHC 109). An illustration of such criticism may be found in\nthe following passage by Susan Gray and Professor Kevin Gray in Elements of Land\ntaw, (OUP, 2009), para 1.5.29:\n'Ths difficulty with this orthodox understanding of proprietary quality is, of course,\nthat it is riddled wilh circularity: the definition of proprietary character becomes\nentirely selffulfilling. lf naively we ask which entitlements are 'proprietarf, we are\ntold that they are those rights which are assignable and enforceable against third\nparties. When we then ask which rights these may be, we are told that they\ncomprise, of course, the entitlements which are traditionally defined as ,pioprietary'.\nIt is radical and obscurantist nonsense to formulate a test of proprietary quality in\nthis way.\"\nThe Board is more impressed with the definilion of the irreducible features of property\noffered by Susan Gray and Profossor Kevin Gray in Elements of Land Law, (OUp,\n2009), para 1.5.32. According to cray and Gray the following are three key features\nwhlch Iie irreducibly at the core of the delinition of property ownership:\nimmunily from summary cancellation or extinguishment\npresumptive entitlement to exclude others\nentitlement to priorilise resourco values.\nBased on the three key fealures, the Board is of the view that the. unused elsctricity\nsupply to the Development may be regarded as a properly right. First, the right to\nelectricily supply is immune from summary cancellalion or extinguishment. As long as\n7STB 92 OF 2014_WATERMARK ROBERTSON OUAY30\n31.the Respondent mel its contractual obligations with the prov,der of the eloctricity supply,\nSP Services Ltd, SP Seryices Ltd does not have the right to summarily cancel the power\nsupply. Second, the Respondent has a presumptive entitlement to exclude third parties\nof the Development from this electricity supply. Finally, the Rsspondent is entitled to\nprioritise the resource value of this electricity supply.\nHowever, even if the unused electricity supply may be characterized as proprietary in\nnature, this right must still come within the definition of 'common property'. 'Common\nproperly is defined by section 2 of the Building Maintenance Strata Management Act\n('BMSMA) as follows:\n(a) in relation to any land and building comprised or to be comprised in a strata title\nplan, such part of the land and building -\n(i) nol comprised in any lot or proposed lot in that strata title plan; and\n(ii) used or capable of being used or enjoyed by occupiers of 2 or more lols or\nproposed lots; or\n(b) in relation to any other land and building, such part ot the land and building -\n(i) not comprised in any non-strata lou and\n(ii) used or capable of being ussd or enioyed by occupiers of 2 or more non-\nstrata lots within that Iand or building; (emphasis added)\nThus, section 2 of the BMSNiIA provides that before somelhing may be regarded as\n'common property' lhe thing concerned must be regarded as forming such pan of th6\nland and building. There are lwo-further pre-requisites to the delinition of 'common\nproperty. First, it must not be comprised in any lot in the strata plan. Second, it must be\nused or capable oi being used or enjoyed by occupiers of two or moro lots. lntangible\nproperty righls may in the proper circumslances be regarded as part of 'common\nproperty'. lt has been held byJudith Prakash J in Fronffield lnvestment Holding (nQ Ud\nv MCST Plan No. 938 t2001) 2 SLR(R) 410 that an easement over land of a third party\nwas also considered lo be part of the common property. Prakash J in Choo Kok Lin and\n8 STB 92 OF 2Ol4.WATERMARK ROBERTSON QUAYJZanother v MCST Plan No 2405 [2005] 4 SLR (R) 175 at [44] rationalised her previous\nholding in Frontfield as lollowsl\n'That holdlng was based on the definition of \"land\" in the Act which made it clear\nthat \"proprietorship of land includes natural rights to air, light, water and support and\ntho right of access to any highway on which the land abuts. An easement is not\ntangible and yet it has long been recognised by the common law as being part of a\nparcel of rights which a purchaser acquires when he purchases a parcel of land\nwhich enjoys an easement over an adjacent parcel\".\nPrakash J's decision in Choo Kok Lin v Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No\n24051200514 SLR (H) 175 considered the trlcky question whether unconsumed cross\nFloor Area allocaled lo a particular development could be considered 'common\nproperty. It is worth quoting in exte,so from this decision at 145 - 471:\n'45 Despite my recognition that land, and lherefore, common proporty, can include\nintangiblo rights, I do not think that unconsumed GFA is capable of constituting land_\nFirst of all, lhe common law does not recognise the concept o{ GFA. lt is not\nsomething that has grown out naturally from the ownership and use of land. GFA is\na concepl that has been invented by the planning authorities in order to control and\nadminister the usage ol land in accordanc\u20ac with the currently prevailing poucy\napplied by such authorities. Secondly, to an extent, the cFA of a development is\ndetermined by the amount of development chargo lhat a developer is prepared to\npay, although of course, there may be guidelines as to the maximum permissible\nGFA in any particular case. All I am pointing out is that there is no pre-designated\nGFA for any particular plot by which I mean a GFA which has to be assigned to that\nplot regardless of the size of the cFA applied for by the devoloper and the amount\nthat the doveloper is willing to pay. As a tool ol planning policy, the GFA does not\nhave an inherent connection with any particular plot. lt ls a crsature of a completely\ndifferent nature from an easemenl which the Act itself describes as a \"natural right\".\nThkdly, the Acl itself has not statutofily included GFA in the definition of \"land' for\nthe purposes of the Act.\n46 As unconsumed GFA cannot be \"land\", a fortioriil cannot be common proper1y...\nSTB 92 OF 2014 -WATERMAR( ROBERTSON QUAY I3447...With respect, I agree that.GFA does not belong to anyone and is not a right of\nsuch a naturo that it is capable of belng owned by anyone. As lh6 appellants\nsubmitted, GFA is simply an administrative tool. As such, it was solely up to the\nURA to increase or decrease lhe GFA for any particular parcel ol land and to decide\nwhat it would do lf construction on the land resulted in it being built up beyond the\nGFA'.\nBased on the wording of section 2 of the BMSI\\,4A and Choo Kok Lin, the Board is ol the\nview that the unused electricity supply is not paperly regarded as 'common property' for\nthe lollowing reasons. First, section 2 of BMSI\\,4A presupposes lhat in mosl cases\n'common property' is a tangible proprietary right. The section refers to ,common\nproperv as being \"such part of the land and building\". lt is very difricult to stretch the\nwords of the statute i.e. 'part of the land and building' lo include unused electricity\nsupply. Second, Prakash J's decision in Frontfield that an easement enioyed by the\nresidents ol a slrata lol over a third partys land should be regarded as ,common\npropertf may be distinguished from the present case. As the learned judge p6rceptively\npointed out, section 4 of the Land Titles Act (which is applicable in the context of the\nBIVSMA) de{ines land as'natural rights to air, light, water and support and the right of\naccess to any highway on which the land abuts'. An-easement being an ancient right\nwhich has been always been regarded as proprietary in nature ,fits, comfortably within\nthe definition ol section 4 of the Land Titles Act. ln contrast, unused electricily supply to\nthe Developmenl is not included within the definition of land in section 4 ol the Land\nTitles Act.\nEven though the Board is of the view that the unused electricity supply is not regarded\nas 'common property within the definition of section 2 of the BMSMA, this does not\nmean lhat lhe Respondent's right to allocate lhe electricity supply is completely\nunfettered. The Respondent musl manage the right to allocate the electricity supply as a\nresponsible management corporation with reference to their legal duties to the\nsubsidiary proprietors. The standard of conduct expected of Management Corporation\nwill be articulated below.\nSTB 92 OF 2014. WATERIIIARK ROBERTSON QUAY 1035Despite the fact that the unused electricity supply is not regarded as common property,\nthe Board is of the view that given that the electricity supply is supplied by switchboards\nin the Development; which form part ol the common property, lhe Applicant would\nrequire the Respondent's consont in carrying out her request. There is no real dispute\nwith regard to this legal proposition as the Applicant accepts that the Respondent,s\nconsent is required.\n.ro _The Board accepts the Applicant's counsel's submission that under Section 29(.1) of the\nBMSMA, it is the duty of a Management Corporation to conlrol, manage and administer\nthe common propefty for the benefit of all the subsidiary proprietors, and that the\nRespondent's refusal lo grant the Applicants request in the present case would fall\nunder Section 101(1)(c), which provides that the Board may make an order for the\nsettlement of a dispute wlth respect to the exercise ol a duly conferred or imposed by\nthe BMSMA. The Applicant's submission is not inconsistent with the Board,s holding\nthat the unused electricity supply is not regarded as'common property', lnorderforthe\nApplicant to upgrade the electriclty supply to her Units, she must make necessary\nadjustments and connections to the relevant electrical swilchboards and cables. These\nelectrical switchboards and cables are undoubtedly 'common proporty,and within the\npurview of the Respondent. Thus, the Respondent must exercise its discretion\njudiciously in relation lo the Applicanfs access to the relevant olectrical switchboards\nand cables in order to upgrade the electricity supply to the Appllcanfs Unils. ln other\nwords, the Respondenfs discretion must be exercised consistenfly with the\nRespondent's legal duty to control, manage and administer common properly for the\nbenefit of all the subsidiary proprielors. lt must be noled that the Applicant,s requesl lo\naccess and make the relevanl adjustments to tho relevant eleclrical switchboards and\ncables in order to upgrade the electricity supply to her Units does not amount to\nexclusive use of common property because other subsidiary proprietors are not deprived\nof the use of these electrical switchboards and cables.\n5TB 92 OF 2014 -WATERMAR( ROBERTSON OUAY 11Whether the Board has iurisdiction to make an order in the present case and/or whether this is a\nmalter which requires a decision to be made al a qeneral meeling of the Manaqement\nCorporation38The Board does not agree with the Respondent's dounsel's submission that the\nApplicant's request would be tantamount to granting 'special privileges to increase her\nusage of the unutilized electricity supply over the other subsidiary proprietors,. As the\nupgrade of the Applicant's electrical supply is to come.from the Development's spare\nelectrical supply, the other subsidiary proprietors will not be deprived ol their existing\nelectricity supply. The Board also found that the Applicanl's request did not amount to a\nrequest for'exclusive use'o, common property. As demonslrated above, the unused\nelectricity supply to the Development cannot be regarded as'common properly'. Thus,\nthe Board found that Section 33 and 101(6) of the BMSMA did not apply in the present\ncase, and the matter is nol one to be decided which requires a decision at a general\nmeeting.\nln any case, the Board has jurisdiclion under Section 111 of the BMSI\\,4A to make an\norder that lhe Respondent consent to the Applicanfs request if it so finds that the\nFlespondent has unreasonably refused the request.\nWhether there wasuff icient soare electrical capacitv the Devolopment\n39.The Board found the Flespondent's arguments lor refusing the Applicant,s request to bo\ninconsistent. For example, the position taken by the Respondent at various times, i.e. in\n2012,2014 and 2015 was inconsistent. lnitially, the Respondenl had taken the view that\nthere was insufficient spare electrical capacity within the Development to upgrade the\nApplicant s Units' electrlcity supply in 2012. ln 2015, the Respondent's position was lhat\nthere simply was no spare capacity available at all.\n40The Board noted that the evidence relating to the sufflciency of spare electrical capacity\nof tho Development given by Mr Ng, Mr Tay Oon Tiong, the current Bullding LEW of the\nDevelopmenl since 2013 (\"tr/r Tay'') and Mr Lim Sui Yong, the Appticant,s LEW (,,Mr\nLim\"), was unanimous. All lhree witnesses, when asked if there was sufticient spare\nelectricity capacity to effect the Applicant's requesl, agreed thaf in lhoir professional\ncapacily as engineers, there was indeed enough spare electrical capacity to do so.\nST8 92 OF 2014 _ WATERMARK ROBERTSON QUAY L241.\n42\n43As explained by Mr Lim, electrical engineers must consider the ,diversity factor, i.e. not\nall the appliances will be switched on at lull capacity at the same lime. Mr. Lim\nelaboraled in para 7 of his Affidavit of Evidence in Chief dated 5 June 20 15 as follows:\nMr Llm cited examples of developments in which he had approved electrical upgrades\nwhich exceeded the building's existing design capacity. He noted that these were\npossible given the operation of the 'diversity factof and recognised engineering practice.\nMr Lim added that if he was to 'mathemalically calculate the sum of the individual\nmaximum electrical demands, that'no upgrading on earth can be done,. His Mews were\nconsistent what those of Mr Tay and Mr Ng, who both took the view that thore was in\nfact sufficient sparo oloctrical capacity to etfect the Applicant,s request.\nWholher e Respondent's decision to reiect the ADDInt's request mav bechallenoed\n44Both the Applicant and Respondent have submitted that the Board would have the\njurlsdiction to interfere if the Bespondent's refusal to allow the Applicant,s requesl was\nunreasonable. lt must be noted that the Applicant and Flespondent differ in their\nsubmissions as to what constitutes unreasonable behavior. Notwithstanding this\napparent agreement of the law between the Applicant and Respond\u20acnt, the Board is not\nbound by a concession of law which may be regarded as erronoous. As Richard\nMalanjum GJ said in NV Multi Corp Bhd & Ors v Suruhanjaya Syarikat lttalaysia l2O1Ol s\nIvILJ 573 at [.16]:\n\"lt has been said that no court is bound to decide a controversy upon an erroneous\nconcession of law made by one of disputants before it, more so when a question of\nSTB 92 OF 2014 -WATERMARK ROBERTSON QUAY'Diversity is in existence in any operating system simply because not all the loads\nconnected to the supply system are operating simultaneously and nol all are\nsimultaneously operating at their maximum ratings.

The most odd of results would follow if a\ncontrary rule is to be applied\"\nNV tlulti Corp Bhd has been applied by the Singapore Court of Appeat in paragon\nFinancein Yong Kheng Leong v Panweld Trading Pte Ltd l2O13l1 SLR 173_\nWhat then is the standard which a Management Corporation's decision is subject to\nreview by the Board? ln order to discern the standard of review, it is important to revert\nto first principles. Since a Management Corporation cannot hold property for itself\nabsolutely, il must follow that the Management Corporation holds property on trust for\nlhe subsidiary proprietors collectively. This is consistent with the general principle\narticulated ln the decision of the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Owners Stata\nPlan 50276 v Thoo 120131 NSWCA 270. . ln Thoo, tho court said that a Management\nCorporation held lhe common property on a statutory trust for the ownors as a whole\nand owed general duties and stalutory duties to lhe owners. lt could be said that lhe\nright to allocate the unused eleclricity supply is a right held by the Respondent on trust\nfor the subsidiary proprietors collectively. Therefore, the Respondent,s duty in lhis\nrespect is akin to a lrustee making a decislon with regard to trust propeny.\nChao Hick Tin JAio Foo Jee Seng v Foo Jhee Tuang 120121 4 SLR 939 succlnc y sets\nout the lollowing principles governing the exercise of a trustee,s discretion in relation to\ntrust property:\n(D'the discretion exercised by the trustees should, as a rule be respected',\n[s1];\n(ii)'\\^/here the discretion is vested in a trustee, that duty has to be exercised\nproperly. The courl cannot intervene unless the discretion is either\nimproperly exercised, or not exercised at all\" [53]; .\n(itDthe 'beneficiaries cannot dictate the way a trustee should exercise his\ndiscretion\" [54]; and47.\nSTg 92 OF 2014 -WATERMARK ROBERTSON OUAY14(iv) while thore is no obligation to follow the beneficiaries' wishes, the trustee\ncannot completely disregard the beneliciaries' wishes and their obiective\nneeds and inlerests [54].\nChao JA in Foo v Foo accepted the. authority ot Re Beloved Wilkes' Charity (1 951) 3\nNIac & G 44Oi 42 ER 330 lhat the courfs superuision will be confined to the ,.honesty,\nintegrity, and fairness with which the deliberation has been conducted, and will nol be\nextended to the accuracy of the conclusion arrivod af'. lt must be noled that Chao JA\ndid not state a final view as to whether reasonableness of the trustees, exercise of\ndiscretidn is a criteria for inlerlerence beyond noling Dundee General Hospital Board of\nl,,,lanagement v Walker [1952] 1 All ER 896, 901 where Lord Normand doubted that\nreasonableness was an appropriate benchmark tor interference,\nThe trustoe is also under a duty to take into account relevant considerations and ignore\nirrelevant considerations in making decisions. As Chao JA observedin Foo v Foo.,\n\"ln our judgmenl, we think that the 1\"t Respondent fhe trusteel has falled to take\ninto ac'count in arriving at his decision not to etfect the sale of lhe propeny at this\ntime, consideralions which he should have taken into account and/or he has taken\ninto account considerations which he should not have taken into accounl (eg, it was\nths Testatofs intention to retain the Property as an ancestral home...), at [67]\nThe Board is of the view that the observations of the Court of App eal in Foo y Foo is also\napposite in the context of a Management Corporation making decisions in relation to\nunused electricity supply. Therefore, we agree with the Respondent's submission lhat\nthe test of review of a l\\ilanagement Corporalion's decision pursuant to sections 101 (c) of\nthe BMSMA cannot be \"a simple test of reasonableness\". The Board cannot be the linal\narbiter ol every decision which a subsidiary proprietor regards as unreasonable. To hold\nolherwise could potentially paralyzo the decision making process of the lvlanagement\nCorporation and inundate the Board with multiple challenges by disgrunfled subsidiary\nproprietors.\nNevertheless, we are ol the view that the Respondent is incorrect to say that the Board\nmay only intervene if the Respondent's decision was tainted with prejudice, malice or49\n50_\n5l\nSTB 92 OF 2014- WATERMARK ROBERTSON QUAY 15indifterence. As seen in Foo v Foo, a court may also intervene in the decision of a\nlrusteo if lhe trustee had taken into account an irrelevant consideration and/or ignored a\nrelevant consideration.\nln determining whether the Respondent's decision is proper, the Board has to take inlo\naccount the intetests of both the Applicant and tho other subsidiary proprietors. The\nBoard has considered carefully the evidence pul forward by both parties. There was a\nclear consensus amongst the experts at trial thal there was sufficient spare eleclrical\ncapacity wilhin th6 Development to cater to the Applicant's request.\nThe Flespondent had erred in adding the individual supply components together in a\nlinear fashion in reaching the conclusion that there would be insufficient spare electrical\ncapacity. Due consideration has to be given to the divorsity factor, which is the ratio of\nthe sum ol the individual maximum loads of various subdivisions to the maximum\ndemand of a complete system. By virtue ol this, buildings can often accommodate\nelectrical upgrades which surpass their original design capacity. ln this regard, the\nRespondent has failed to take into account a relevant consideration i-e. the diversity\nfactor in arriving at the decision to reject the Applicant's request to upgrade the electrical\nsupply to her Units. lt must be noted that there was no real disputo between the experts\nabout whether there was sufficient electricity supBly to meet the Applicant,s request.\nEven the Respondent's expert thought as a professional engineer there was sutficient\ncapacity to meet the Applicant's request. By ignoring the Respondent's own LEW,S\nopinion, the Respondent has failed to take into account a relevant consideration.\nAt trial, Mr de Souza gave evidence tor the Respondent. When asked about the\nCouncil's reasons for rejecting the Applicant's request in his examinalion-in-chief, he\nadmitted that the Council was concerned that if such a request was granted, the shop\nunits would operate 24-hour businesses, like a pizza delivery. This, he said, would\nadversely affect the residential units which are situated directly above the shop units.\nsecurity would also be a cause for concern as delivery people would be loitering around\nat all times of the day.\nThe Board noted that the considerations raised by Mr de souza at trial were never\ncommunicated to the Applicant. while thore is generally no duty to give reasons to theq,\n55\nST8 92 OF 2014 -WATERMARK ROBERTSON QUAY1630.Applicant, the Board thinks that it is good practice to do so (see Chia Sok Kheng\nKathleen v MCST Plan No 669 l2004l4 SLR(B) 27 at [98]). However, a Management\nCorporation is not entitled to take into account an irrelevant consideration when coming\nIo a decision. ln any oase, the Board is of the view thal such concerns can be managed\nbythe passing of relevant by-laws to prevent disruption to the residenllat units which are\nsituated above the Applicant's Units. The Respondent failed to raise any other reasons\nfor rejecting the Applicanfs request. As such, the Respondenl had taken into account\nan irrelevant consideration in refuslng the Applicant's request.\nGiven the circumstances, the Board found that the Respondent,s refusal of the\nApplicant's request was impropor because the Respondent had lailed to take into\naccount a relevant consideration (that lhere was spare capacity and the LEW,s opinion)\nand taken on board inelevant consideralions (the fear that the Applicant would tenant\nher Units to a pizza delivery).\nEven if the Board is wrong with regard to the standard of review of the Respondenfs\nconducl, the Board is of the view that Respondent's refusal of the Applicant,s request is\nregarded as unreasonable in that the Respondenfs conduct is tainted by prejudice,\nmalice and indifference (see Chia Sok Kheng Kathleen v IV|CST plan No 669 lZOO4l 4\nSLR(R) 27 at [34). This line of argument is based on section 1i 1 of the BMSMA which\nprovides that the Board has tho jurisdiction lo intervene if the Management Corporation\nhad unreasonably refused to consenl to a proposal by that subsidiary proprietor to effect\nallerations to the common property. As Kan Ting Chiu J said in Chia Sok Kheng\nKathleen v MCST Plan No 669 t20047 4 SLR(R) 2Z at 1341:\n'When a management corporalion receives an application affecting the common\nproperly, it should exercise its discrelion for the benerit of all the subsidiary\nproprietors. That means lhat the interests ol the applicant subsidiary proprietor as\nwell as the intorests of the other subsidiary proprielors ar6 to be taken into account.\nThe discretion should bo exercised responsibly. Applications should be dealt with\nconsistentiy without favouritism or bias, but flexibility should be retained to take into\naccount changing circumstances. poljcies adopted should not be regarded as edicts\nset in stone\".\nSIB 92 OF 2014 *WATERMARK ROBERTSON QUAY7758.Since lhe Applicant's request to upgrade would affect some electrical switchboards and\ncables which are common property, lhe proposal would fall within the ambit of section\n1 11 of the BMSMA. While the Board does not think that the Respondent acted with\nprejudice and malice, the Respondent's conduct may be charactorized as being\ninditferent. Since there is clear evidence thal there was suilicient electricity supply, the\nRespondent's refusal lo allow the Applicant to upgrade her electricity supply is regarded\nas being indlfferent in the face ol oblective evidonce. Furlhermore, a Management\nCorporation's declsion is not regarded as properly exercised if it was actuated by\nextraneous consideralions (see Chia Sok Kheng Kathleen v I/ICST Plan No 669l2104l 4\nSLR(R) 27 at [55]). tn this regard, the Respondent's refusal to allow the Applicant to\nupgrado the electricity supply was partly motivated by extraneous considerations i.e. the\nfear that she would tenant her Units to a pizza delivery business.\nCONCLUSION\n59.The Board recognises that all buildings are built to a specified design capacity. However,\nsome flexibil;ty has to be afforded to take inlo account individual subsidiary proprietor,s\nneeds. The Board is mindful that these considerations have to be balanced against the\nother subsidiary proprietors interests and the Board's discretion has to be exercised\nsensibly. Where the Management Corporation has concerns about the impact that an\napplicant's request might have on the other subsidiary proprietors, the Management\nCorporation should also consider whether the passing of appropriate bylaws might be\nan appropriate solution.\n60The Board should only interfere where the decision ot a Management Corporation is\nclearly improper and/or unreasonable. ln the present caso, the Board found that lhe\nRespondent's refusal of the Applicant's request was improper and/or unreasonable. The\nApplicant had purchased her Units with the intention ol letting them oul lo tenants. Giv6n\nthe consensus amongst the witnesses for bolh parties lhat there was in facl sufficient\nspare eleclrical capacity to cater to the Applicant's request, the Respondent had failed to\ntake this on board as a relevant consideration. lnstead, the Respondent had taken into\naccount exlraneous factors which are irrelevant in refusing hsr request.\n61 . ln view of all of the above, the Board orders that:-\n5IB 92 OF 2014 -WATERMAR( ROBERTSON QUAYa.

He said the dampness on the false ceiling progressed into water dripping \nonto the floor.\n3.He contacted a contractor, one Mr Lee in September to investigate. He said Mr Lee \ncut an opening in the false ceiling and confirmed that a discharge pipe beneath the \nceiling slab was leaking. He said Mr Lee went up to the unit above and turned on the \nkitchen tap and more water could be seen dripping out of the pipe. The Respondents \nwere notified.\n4.It was confirmed that the drainage pipe served the Respondents\u2019 unit exclusive ly \nalthough a section of it protruded below the Respondent's floor slab into the false \nceiling space of the Applicants \u2019 unit. It was that section of the pipe situated in his unit \nthat was leaking.\n5.AW1 said that the leaking pipe had since bee n replaced and his wall had been \nrepainted by the Respon dents. AW1 said Respondents did the repairs after he had filed \nhis application with the Strata Titles Boards.\n6.AW1 said he is claiming the costs of this application and the hearing and he is not \nprepared to pay the Respon dents the $1500 they are claiming from him.\nRespondents\u2019 Case :  \n7.Koh Lin Kee and Ong Siew Seo (RW1) are the subsidiary proprietors of unit XXX \nPandan Valley. Their unit is directly above the Applicants\u2019 unit.\n8.RW1 agreed that the leaking drainage pipe served her unit exclusively. She, however, \nis of the view that as the leaking section of the pipe was not within her unit but \nsituated in the Applicants\u2019 unit, it was the responsibility of the Applicants to repair \nand maintain that section of the pipe.\n9.She took her case to her Member of Parliament.\n10.She said the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) in response to her \nMP\u2019s query, wrote her a letter which supported her view.3 11. BCA wrote :\n\u201c\u2026 we would like to clarify that the sewe r pipes that serve the upper floor unit in\ncarrying the discharge from their water closet and wash basin above to the common\nvertical stack pipe below as they are located at the ceiling of the lower floor unit are to\nbe maintained by the lower floor unit owner as those pipes are situated within the lot of\nthe lower floor unit. This responsibility is implied by virtue of Section 30(2)(c) of the\nBuilding Maintenance and Strata Management Act (BMSMA)\u201d.\n12. She said that she had spent a total of $1500 replacing the leaking pip e in Applicants\u2019\nunit and painting the study room wall which was stained by the leak. As the\nmaintenance of that section of the pipe within Applicants\u2019 unit is not her responsibility\nas confirmed by BCA, she now wants to claim from the Applicants the sum of $1500.\n13. Further, she added that her view is also supported by Section  101 of the BMSMA.\nBoard\u2019s Finding :  \n14. The relevant facts are not disputed. The defective drainage pipe served only the\nRespondents\u2019 unit and no one else. A section of this protruded i nto the Applicants\u2019 unit\nbefore joining the vertical stack because of the nature of construction o f that particular\ndevelopment.\n15. It was this section of the pipe situated within the Applicants\u2019 unit that was leaking.\n16. The drainage pipe in this case was by definition not a common property as it served\nonly the Respondents\u2019 unit exclusively. We find that the whole pipe belonged to the\nRespondents notwithstanding that a section of it was situated within the unit of the\nApplicants and the Respondents were solely responsible to repair and maintain it.\n17. In coming to the above finding, we are guided by Warren L.H Khoo J in the case of\nTsui Sai Cheong and another v Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 1186\nand others [1995] 3SLR(R) 713. Khoo J held that the fact that part of a pipe belonging\nto the Appellants was embedded in the concrete slab which was common property did\nnot turn that part into common property. What the Appellants had in relation to that\npart of the water pipe embedded in the common property was an easement through\nthat part of the common property.\n18. Similarly, in our case, a part of a drainage pipe belonging to the Respondents\nprotruding into the Applicants\u2019 unit did not make that part of the pipe the Applicants\u2019\nproperty. The Respondents, as owners of the pipe, must be solely responsible for its\nrepair and maintenance.\n19. With due respect to BCA, we are not able to agree with their view that the section of\nthe pipe, because it was situated within the Applicants\u2019 lot, it was the responsibility of\nthe Applicants to repair and maintain it. BCA stated that this responsibility was\nimplied by section 30(2)(c) of the BMSMA.4 Section 30 of the BMSMA provides as follows:- \nPowers of Management Corporation to carry out work \n30 (1)  Where a notice ha s been served on the subsidiary proprietor of a lot by a \npublic authority requiring that subsidiary proprietor to carry out any work on \nor in relation to that lot and the notice is not complied with, the management \ncorporation may carry out the w ork. \n(2)Where a subsidiary proprietor, mortgagee in possession, lessee or occupier of\na lot fails or neglects to carry out any work  \u2014\n(a)required to be carried out by him under a term or condition of a by -\n  law referred to in section  33; \n(b) necessary to remedy a breach of the duty imposed on him by\nsection  63(a);\n(c)to rectify any defect in any water pipe or sewer pipe within his lot or\nany cracks in the wall or floor within his lot; o r\n(d)necessary to rectify his contraventi on of section  37(1),\nthe management corporation may carry out that work\n(3)\u2026\u2026\u2026.\n(4)\u2026\u2026\u2026..\n(5) \u2026\u2026\u2026..\n(6) \u2026\u2026\u2026.\n20. In our view, S30(2)(c) of the BMSMA gives the MCST powers to rectify any defects\nin a lot where a subsidiary proprietor, etc, fails or neglects to do so.\n21. There is nothing in S30(2)(c) to imply the change of responsibility from the owners of\nthe defective pipes to another person.\n22. We are also unable to see how S101 of the BMSMA could help the Respondents in\ntheir case.\n23. For the above reasons, we dismissed the claim of the Respondents.5 24. We order that the Respondents pay to the Applicants the application fee of $500 and\nthe hearing fees of $600.\nDated this 8th day of May  2015 \n SENG KWANG BOON  \n Deputy President \nLAI HUEN POH \nMember \nTAN KIAN HOON \nMember "

The Applicant is one Patrick Wee Hock Chye. He is the subsidiary proprietor of unit \n#XXX Craig Place located at No. 20 Craig Road Singapore 089682.\n2. The Respondent is one Jason Low Kok Sum. He is the subsidiary proprietor of unit \n#XXX Craig Place which is adjacent to the Applicant\u2019s unit .\nThe Applicant\u2019s claim : \n3. The Applicant alleged that on the 23rd April 2014, his tenant returned to Singapore\nafter a vacation and found a puddle of water on the kitchen floor area in unit # XXX . \nThe Applicant said that water had leaked from the Respondent\u2019s unit through the \npartition wall into his unit. He claimed that the water leakage had caused damage to \nhis property which he had quantified under the following heads of claim:\n4. \na)Lower Kitchen Cabinet : $4355  \nb)Waterproofing and repairs\nto the masonry wall : $500  \nc)Install back existing sink with tap : $200  \nd) Replace and polish damaged\nmarble tiles on the kitchen floor : $5900  \ne)Loss of rental from 27 July 2014\nto 26 July 2015 : $60,000 \nf)Cost incurred in filing this application : $500  \ng) Cost incurred in the preparation of\nAffidavits : $1200  \nh)Cost of fees for this Hearing : $300  \ni)Agent Fees : UNSPECIFIED \nj)Medical bills for injuries caused by\nthe Respondent : $107  \nRespondent\u2019s Defence : \n5. Respondent admitted that the leak was from a pipe in his bathroom. He had it repaired\non 29 April 2014.3 6. He however disputed the extent of the damages caused by the leak and disagreed with\nthe quantum claimed by the Applicant.\n7. He also denied that the leakage had caused the loss of rental. He further denied claims\nunder items (f) to (j).\nBoard\u2019s Findings : \n9. On the evidence adduced we find that the leak originated from the Respondent\u2019s unit.\nWater from the leaking pi pe in Respondent\u2019s unit seeped through the wall for an\nunknown number of days until discovered by Applicant\u2019s tenant when he returned to\nthe unit after his vacation.\nDamages to kitchen cabinet, wall, sink and tap under items (a) , (b) and (c): \n10. As there was nothing to the contrary, we accept the \u201cObservation Report\u201d from An\nQuan Renovation and Construction Company and find that these damages were\ncaused by the leaking concealed pipes in the adjoining wall.\n11. The replacement and repairs for these items amounted to a total of $5055. We allow\nthese claims.\nDamage to marble flooring item (d): \n12. There were insufficient evidence adduced by the Applicant to show the extent of\nstaining and damages to the marble floor and whether the tiles needed to be replace d\nand how many of them.\n13. We are of the view that a grind and polish would suffice and reasonable in the\ncircumstances of this case.\n14. The cost of grind and polish had been quoted by one of Applicant\u2019s contractor -\nDisaster Restoration Pte. Ltd. to be $1800.\n15. We allow $1800 under this item.\nLoss of Rental - item (e): \n16. The damages caused by the leakage were confined to the wall behind the kitchen\ncabinet, the lower kitchen cabinet itself and the staining on the marble tiles on the\nfloor of the kitchen area. We accept the loss adjuster\u2019s, one Alvin Anthony , evidence\nthat these damages were minimal and should not have rendered the Applicant\u2019s unit to\nbe in a condition that was not habitable.\n17. We note that the tenant had stayed on to the end of July 2014 almost 3 months after\nthe reported leakage. It did not appear that the unit was not habitable. The tenancy had\nearlier been renewed for another year but Applicant had allowed the tenant to break\nthe tenancy on account of perceived dust, noise, loss of privacy and insecurity and\nhealth grounds.4 18. This claim is also dismissed.\nAgent Fees under item (i): \n19. There is no evidence adduced that Applicant is going to incur agent fees. We note that\nthe Applicant is a housing agent himself.\n20. This claim is dismissed.\nMedical Bills under item (j): \n21. There is no merit in this claim. There was a personal fight between them.\n22. This claim is dismissed.\nCosts under items (f), (g) and (h): \n23. As the Applicant did not succeed in all his claims, each party shall bear his own costs.\nOrder of the Board:- \na) The Board orders that the Respondent pays to the Applicant the sum of\n$6855.00 ($5055 + $1800).\nb) In the event the Respondent fails to comply with this order, the Applicant may\nproceed to take all reasonable steps to give effect to the same and recover all\ncosts incurred as a debt from the Respondent.\nDated this 12th day of January  2015 \nMR SENG KWANG BOON  \nDeputy President \nMR.

The development known as VisionCrest Residences (MCST Plan 3400) is\nlocated at 33 -39 Oxley Rise/101 -103 Penang Road, Singapore. It is a mixed\nuse development and comprises three (3) buildings viz a commercial block with\n81 office and retail units, a residential block with 265 residential units and a\nheritage building known as The House of Tan Yeok Nee. The total area in the\ncommercial block is 13 ,440 sqm and the whole block is owned by Union\nInvestment Real Estate GMBH (UIRE). The residential block has a total area of\n23,460 sqm and there are 265 owners. The heritage building has a total ar ea of\n3,101 sqm. The aggregate share value of each block is as follows:\n(a)Commercial block \u2013 48,599,\n(b)Residential block \u2013 45,315,\n(c)Heritage building \u2013 6,086.\nTotal aggregate share value is 100 ,000. Accordingly the commercial block has \n48.599% of the tota l share value, the residential block, 45.315% and the \nheritage building, 6.086% . \n2. The Applicant is Christopher Yau King Min (Yau). He is the owner of one of the \nresidential units viz #XXX and the Respondent is Management Corporation  \nStrata Title Plan No. 3400 (the MC).\n3. CBRE Pte Ltd (CBRE) is the managing agent (MA) of the estate. The developer  \n(Winpeak Investment Pte Ltd) had in 2006, before the estate was handed over \nto the MC approached CBRE to manage the estate and at the 1st Annual  \nGeneral Meeting (AGM) of the MC on the 20/08/2010, CBRE was via a \nresolution passed without objections, appointed as the MA. CBRE was re-\nappointed as the MA at the 2nd and 3rd AGMs.\n4. The 4th Annual General Meeting of the MC was held on the 22/08/2013. At that \nmeeting a resolution was passed re-appointing CBRE as the managing agent \nfor a further period of one year. Voting was by poll. The total share value voting \nwas 71,804 and 57,176 (79%) voted in favour of the resolution while 14,628  \nvoted against.\n5. In this application the Applicant is applying for the following orders:\nOrder No 1 .  \nTo seek an order that the resolution passed at the 4th AGM on 21st August 2013 \non the appointment of the managing agent be invalidated  Page 3 of 11 \n Order No 2.  \nTo seek an order that the respondent be directed to fix the biometric gate at the \nBBQ area and to build a perimeter fence along the sides of the biometric gate \nwithin two weeks from the date of the order and to ensure that commercial \nemployees from the uni ts tenanted out by UIRE  do not freely cross over and \nuse the facilities  \n \nOrder No 3.  \nTo seek an order that directs the respondent t o provide an explanation for \nfailure to adhere to the Second Schedule of BMSMA Reg 3 and 4  \n \nOrder No 4.  \nTo order the respondent to indemnify the applicant for all costs arising from this \napplication  \n \n6. When this application was initially filed on the 05/05/2014 Orders No . 2, 3 and 4 \nabove were numbered as 3, 5 and 6 i.e. the application was for 6 orders. The \nApplicant has since informed that he is not pursuing his applications for two of \nthe 6 orders.  \n \nOrder No 1: To seek an order that the resolution passed at the 4th AGM on 21st \nAugust 2013 on the appointment of the managing agent be invalidated  \n \n7. The submission on behalf of the Applicant is as follows:  \n \nThe Applicant submits that the said appointment of the Managing Agent is \ninvalid. The Applicant submits that he is relying on Section 103 of the BMSMA \n\u2026. \n \n8. S 103(1) of the Building Maintenance And S trata Management Act, Chapter \n30C (the Act) is as follows:  \n \nWhere pursuant to an application by a subsidiary proprietor\u2026a Board considers \nthat the provisions of the Act have not been complied with in relation to a \nmeeting of the management corporation, the  Board may by order \u2013 \ninvalidate any resolution\u2026or  \nrefuse to invalidate any such resolution\u2026.  \n \n9. The Respondent has in its written submissions referred to the following extract \nfrom Strata Title in Singapore and Malaysia:  \n \n\u201c\u2026 this provision allows a resolution\u2026to be declared invalid only if the \nprovisions of the BMSMA relating to management corporation\u2026  meetings have \nnot been complied with\u2026.  Page 4 of 11 \n  \n10. It was the submission of the Applicant that CBRE had a business relationship \nwith the owner of the commercial block and this business relationship had not \nbeen declared.  \n \n11. CBRE has an Asset Management Division. This division has  been engaged by \nUIRE to represent and assist it in various matters. There is no evidence that \nUIRE or CBRE had in any way tried to keep th eir relationship private or prevent \nit from being known by others in the estate.  \n \n12. S 66(4) of the Act is as follows:  \n \nA managing agent who is in any way directly or indirectly related to a subsidiary \nproprietor of a lot\u2026shall declare in writing the nature o f his relationship prior to \nhis appointment  \n \n13. The MC has exhibited letters dated 27/09/2010, 24/10/2011, 20/09/2012, \n10/04/2013 and 26/09/2013 wherein CBRE has declared its relationship with \nUIRE to the management council of the MC.  \n \n14. S 60 of the Act is as follows:  \n \nSubject to subsections (2) and (3), if a member of a council has a pecuniary \ninterest, direct or indirect, in any contract, proposed contract or other matter \nwhich is before any meeting\u2026he shall at that meeting \u2013 \ndeclare the nature of his interes t; \nnot take part in any consideration or discussion of, or vote on any question with \nrespect to, that contract or proposed contract or other matter, and  \n\u2026 \n \n(2) The requirements of subsection (1) shall not apply in any case where the \ninterests of the member  of a council consists of being only a member or creditor \nof a company which is interested in a contract or proposed contract with the \nmanagement corporation if the interest of the member may be properly \nregarded as not being a material interest  \n \n(3) For the purposes of subsection (1) a general notice given to the members of \nthe council by a member to the effect that he is an officer or a member of a \nspecified company\u2026and is to be regarded as interested in any contract which \nmay, after the date of the noti ce be made with that company\u2026shall be deemed \nto be a sufficient declaration of interest in relation to any contract so made\u2026.  \n \n15. At the 1st AGM of the MC three (3) of U IRE\u2019s nominees were elected as council \nmembers. Two of them were employees of CBRE (R4A Ta b 1 and R4B Tab Page 5 of 11 \n 27). At that meeting it was resolved that CBRE be appointed as the MA of the \nMC up to the conclusion of the next AGM. The minutes do not record that any \ndeclaration was made by the 3 nominees of UIRE.  \n \n16. At the 1st council meeting of the 1st management council of the MC on the \n27/09/2010 it is recorded (RB4 Tab 9) that declaration forms were distributed \nby the MA to the members of the management council for their execution. The \ndeclarations made by members of the council of the 1st management council \n(and also by members of the council of the 2nd and 3rd management councils) \nare exhibited at R -4B Tab 27.  \n \n17. It would appear from the submissions of the MC (para 16 - of MC\u2019s Reply \nSubmissions - R5) that no declarations in accordance with S 60 had bee n \nmade when the meeting voted on the appointment of CBRE as MA at the 4th \nAGM. It was submitted that a S 60 declaration was not necessary because (i) \nthe council members who were CBRE employees were employees of a \ndifferent division of the company from the  division of the company that obtained \nthe managing agent contract; and (ii) as employees of a different division that \nobtained the managing agent contract, they did not have any material interest \nthat had to be declared. The case of Management Corporation  Strata Title Plan \nNo 2285 and others v Sum Lye Heng (alias Lim Jessie) [2004] 2 SLR(R) 408 \nwas cited in support. It is the view of the Board that the case of Lim Jessie does \nnot support the submission of the MC as the facts in that case were that the \nrelationship and interest of Lim Jessie  (who was the chairman of the managing \ncouncil) in the company that was tendering for the managing agent contract \nwas well known to all the members of the council. It is not clear in this case that \nthe relationship betwee n the nominees of UIRE  in CBRE was known and the \nfact that they were employed in a different division from that which obtained the \nMA contract cannot be said that they did not have an interest that was not \nmaterial. As employees of a company that was seeking to obtain the MA \ncontract for the estate they definitely had an interest that was material. The \ninterests should have been declared.  \n \n18. S 103(2) of the Act is as follows:  \n \nA Board shall not make an order under subsection (1) refusing to invalidate a \nresolution \u2026 unless it considers \u2013 \n(a) that the failure to comply \u2026did not prejudicially affect any person; and  \n(b) that compliance with the provisions \u2026would not have resulted in a failure to \npass the resolution \u2026.  \n \n19. It is clear that an order to invalidate must be  made  when failure to comply has \nprejudicially affected another and compliance would have resulted in a failure Page 6 of 11 \n to pass the resolution or affected the election i .e. compliance would have \nproduced a different result.  \n \n20. Where a failure to comply had not prejudicially affected anyone or compliance \nwould not have resulted in failure to pass the resolution a Board can under S \n103(1)(b) of the Act refuse to invalidate. Where no one has been prejudicially \naffected, there would be no reason for the Board to inv alidate. Similarly there \nwould be no reason to invalidate when the failure to comply would not have \naffected the outcome. Invalidating when no one has been prejudiced or when \ncompliance would not have affected the outcome would serve no purpose \nwhatsoever . \n \n21. The minutes of the meeting reveal that before the votes were cast on the \nmotion the meeting was informed that no invitations had been sent to anyone to \nsubmit quotations; remarks had been made that it was good governance to \nobtain at least three quotatio ns and that in future quotations should be \nobtained; there was a motion for the appointment of CBRE to be for a period of \nthree months pending the outcome of an invitation for quotations; CBRE \ninformed that the company would not accept an appointment of th ree months; \nthe generally good reputation of CBRE was not in dispute.  \n \n22. The resolution was passed by a majority vote of 57 ,176 (79.63%) against a \nminority vote of 14 ,628 (20.37%).  \n \n23. It was the submission of the MC that the application for invalidation must fail \nbecause the Applicant had not shown how he had been prejudicially affected \nby the breach and how compliance with the provisions of the Act would have \nresulted in a failure to pass the resolution. At the arbitration hearing Teddy \nKhong, the representat ive of CBRE testified that the two employees of CBRE \nwho were members of the council did not participate in the voting for the \nappointment of CBRE as MA. This was because Ms Eva Schulten -Baumer , an \nemployee of UIRE was the only representative of UIRE who w as authorised to \ncast all of U IRE\u2019s share value (aggregate of 54,685  which consists of 48,599 \nshare  value  in the commercial block and 6,086 share  value  in the Heritage \nBuilding ). \n \n24. It is the finding of the Board that there was in this case a breach of the \nprovisions of the Act viz S 60 of the Act when the resolution appointing CBRE \nas MA was passed. This was because two council members who were \nrepresentatives of UIRE  and who were al so employees of CBRE had a \npecuniary interest in the motion to appoint CBRE as MA had not declared their \ninterest. No prejudice was caused by the breach. Inter alia the two council \nmembers did not participate in the voting and there is also no evidence Page 7 of 11 compliance would have resulted in the motion being defeated. It was in fact \nclear that compliance would not have affected the result of the voting . \n25. The attention of the Board was also drawn to the fact that at the 5th AGM on the\n01/10/14 the meeting had pass ed two resolutions viz to approve the\nappointment of a managing agent as recommended by the management\ncouncil and for the management council to determine what powers, duties and\nfunctions should be delegated to the managing agent. In view of the fact that\nthe incoming management council has been empowered to appoint a managing\nagent any invalidation of the resolution to appoint CBRE as managing agent at\nthe 4th AGM would be redundant and superfluous once an appointment is made\nby the management council in accordance with the resolution passed at the 5th\nAGM.\n26. The Applicant has also referred to S 112 of the Act in support of his application\nfor Order No 1. Under S 112 of the Act the Board, pursuant to an application by\na subsidiary proprietor, can when it is satisfied that it is in the interests of all the\nsubsidiary proprietors to do so, order the management corporation to appoint a\nmanaging agent. It is clear that the provision is applicable when no managing\nagent has been appointed under S 66 of the Act. O ther than the fact no\napplication had ever been filed for an order to be made under this section of the\nAct there is no evidence or submissions as to how S 112 is relevant to the\napplication for the order sought.\n27. In addition to the above there were submis sions on the fact that no quotations\nhad been invited/asked for before the meeting voted on the motion  to appoint\nCBRE as the MA  (there is no provision in the Act that requires that quotations\nbe invited from other interested parties before a management co rporation can\nvote on a motion to appoint a managing agent) ; allegations that House Rules\nwere not properly enforced by the MA. Yau was  unhappy that tenants in the\ncommercial block were using facilities on the common property and unhappy\nwith the manner the MA was managing the estate. The MC did not agree with\nhis views. The Board was not satisfied that these were in any way relevant to\nthe application.\nOrder No 2: To seek an order that the respondent be directed to fix the \nbiometric gate at the BBQ area  and to build a perimeter fence along the sides \nof the biometric gate within two weeks from the date of the order and to ensure \nthat commercial employees from the units tenanted out by UIRE  do no t freely \ncross over and use the facilities  \n28. It can be noted that in the above, the Applicant is seeking for orders against the\nMC to repair a gate and to build a fence.Page 8 of 11 29. The gate is located near the exit of the commercial block at the pond area and\nit is 0.5 metres high. It is the case for the Applicant that the or der should be\nmade because the MC has in this case breached its responsibilities.\n30. According to Teddy Khong (R4A) the gate was erected by the developer and\nhas been there since the estate was handed over to the MC by the developer. It\nis not clear what the  intention of the developer was when the gate was erected.\nA query had been made to the developer as to the purpose of the gate and the\nreply received was not helpful. It was built \u201cin accordance with as approved\nplans\u201d.  It is 0.5 metres high and cannot co rdon off the common facilities at the\nresidential block s from the commercial block s.\n31. It is the case for Yau that the reason for the gate is to ensure that only those\nwho are authorized shall be allowed to have access to the residential area s.\n32. There was  nothing in the Applicant\u2019s case as to what was wrong with the gate\nthat needs fixing. (In the minutes of the EOGM on 04/01/12 Yau had said that\n\u201cthe low gate that segregated the commercial block from the residence block\nposed a security issue\u201d It would ap pear that he was asking for a replacement of\nthe gate. He expressed strongly that office tenants should not be entitled to use\nthe facilities. )\n33. It was the evidence of Teddy Khong that the gate at the BBQ area never gave\nany trouble because it was hardly e ver used. There was a period of time, when\nbecause biometric gates at other locations in the estate were faulty, some\ncomponents from the gate at the BBQ area were taken out and used to fix the\nfaulty gates. The components taken out have since been put bac k into the gate\nat the BBQ area and it is functioning as it is supposed to.\n34. There is no evidence that the gate is faulty or that it is not functioning in the\nmanner that it is supposed to.\n35. With regard to the application for the installation of a perimete r fence, it must be\nnoted that this must be considered as an improvement and/or an alteration to\nthe common property. It is relevant to note that under S 29(1)(d) of the Act the\nMC is required to install and/or provide additional facilities and/or make\nimprovements to common property when directed by a special resolution. It is\nnot in dispute that the MC has not in this case been directed by a special\nresolution to install such a fence.\n36. Under S 111 of the Act a Board can where \u201c\u2026 the management corporation\u2026\n(a) has unreasonably refused to consent to a proposal by a subsidiary\nproprietor to effect alterations to the common property or (b) has unreasonably\nrefused to authorise under S 37(4) any improvement which affects thePage 9 of 11 \n appearance of any building\u2026make an o rder that the management corporation \nconsents to the proposal.  \n \n37. It is clear that under S 111 the Board can make an order only after the \nmanagement corporation has unreasonably refused to consent to a proposal by \na subsidiary proprietor to effect an alterat ion to the common property.  There is \nno evidence that Yau had, before the filing of the application in this case made \nany proposal for the installation of a perimeter fence. The MC has submitted \nthat at the 5th AGM on the 01/10/14, Yau submitted a resoluti on for the \nconstruction of a perimeter fence.  The minutes of the meeting reveal that the \nmotion was defeated by a vote of 4 ,240 share value (6.86%) for the motion and \n57,547 share value (93.14%) against.  \n \n38. Considering that the proposal had been considered and rejected at a general \nmeeting of the MC, the Board cannot find that that there has been any \nunreasonable refusal to consent.  \n \n39. In addition to the above there were submissions on owners of residential lots \nbeing not agreeable to the sharing of common pro perty; the hand book for \ncommercial owners were not distributed to the owners of the residential units \nuntil October 2013; the extent of usage of the facilities by employees in the \ncommercial units was not known to the subsidiary proprietors in the residen tial \nblock. The Board was not satisfied that these were in any way relevant to the \napplication for the order sought.  \n \nOrder No 3: To seek an order that directs the respondent to provide an \nexplanation for failure to adhere to the Second Schedule of BMSMA. \nRegulations 3 and 4  \n \n40. It will be in order to note that whilst the Board has powers to make orders with \nregard to the various matters set out in the Act, there is no provision in the Act \nthat empowers the Board to make an order for anyone to provide an \nexpla nation for an act done or not done. Where the Act requires an act to be \ndone and it is not done, the Board will make an order for the act to be done. \nWhere an act prohibited by the Act has been done, the Board will order the \nwrongdoer to do the necessary t o comply with the Act.  \n \n41. In his Opening Statement and Applicant\u2019s Submission (A -1), it was on behalf of \nYau submitted The Applicant shall rely on S 113 of the BMSMA for an order to \nsupply information or documents and for breach of Regulations 3 and 4 of th e \nSecond Schedule of the BMSMA. The Applicant shall also rely on S 60(7) \nwherein declarations of interests are supposed to be minuted but for the past 4 \nyears this was not done . \n Page 10 of 11 \n 42. Under S 113 of the Act the Board can, where the management corporation has \nwrongfully withheld from an applicant any information or failed to make \navailable for inspection records/documents that the applicant is entitled to \nreceive or inspect, make an order for the management corporation to supply or \nmake available the information,  records or documents. S 47 of the Act identifies \nthe information, records, and documents that an applicant is entitled to \nreceive/inspect and the process with regard to the mode of application and \nprovision of the information/records/documents. Yau referr ed to applications \nmade for the commercial owner\u2019s handbook to be made available to him. His \nrequests were initially rejected but eventually the handbook was made \navailable. Other than this there is no evidence that Yau had made an \napplication under S 47 o f the Act and that the MC had wrongfully withheld or \nfailed to make available any information, records or documents . \n \n43. It was also submitted on behalf of Yau that he would also rely on S60(7) of the \nAct in support of his application for the order sought viz  the relationship \nbetween the members of the council who were CBRE employees were not \nminuted anywhere. The Board has dealt with the non -declaration of the CBRE \nemployees in the council when the meeting was voting on the appointment of \nCBRE at the 4th AGM.  Other than this it is not clear how S 60 (7) of the Act is \nrelevant to an application for Order No 3 . \n \n44. Regulation 3 of the Second Schedule of the Act provides for the keeping of \nminutes of council meetings and general meetings and Regulation 4 provides \nfor the giving of notice of meetings of the council. Regulation 3 requires that the \nminutes be displayed on a notice board or if there is no notice board for a copy \nof the minutes to be given to the subsidiary proprietors. It is not Yau\u2019s case that \nsuch minu tes are not kept or that notices have not been given. It is his case \nthat only recently, after he brought up the issue with MC that minutes of council \nmeetings were put up on the notice board and that there were errors in the \nminutes. It was the evidence o f Teddy Khong that at all times Regulations 3 \nand 4 of the Second Schedule of the Act have been complied with. With regard \nto errors in the minutes they were corrected before the final set of the minutes \nwere published.  \n \n45. There is no evidence that the MC had not adhered to Regulations 3 and 4 of \nthe Second Schedule of the Act.  \n \n46. In addition to the submissions referred in the above there were submissions \nthat the secretary should be removed because she had not minuted \ndeclarations of interest; the nature of a management council (likened to a board \nof directors in a company); that it was not right that UIRE  who owned 81 office \nand retail units in the estate and held an aggregate of 54,685 shares (which \nconsists of 48,599 shares in the commercial block and 6,086 shares in the Page 11 of 11 \n House of Tan Yeok Nee  (Heritage Building )) i.e. 54.685 % of the total share \nvalue had three nominees in the council (the MC pointed out that  the number \nwas less than what was allowed under the Act (S53(8) of the Act). The Board \ndid not cons ider these to be relevant to the application for the order sought.  \n \n47. In view of our findings, the applications for Orders 1, 2 and 3 are dismissed. We \nwill hear parties on costs.  \n \n \nDated this 12th day of  December 2014  \n \n \n \n_____________________ _ \nMR FRANCIS GEORGE REMEDIOS  \nDeputy President  \n____  \n____________________ _ \nMR CHAN KIM MUN  \nMember  \n \n___________________________ _ \nMS HAIRANI SABAN HARDJOE  \nMember   \n "

Zhang Li\n\u2026 Respondents  \nCoram: Mr Alfonso Ang \nDeputy President \nPanel Members: Mrs Tan Sook Yee \nMr Lee Keh Sai \nCounsel: Mr Michael Por and Ms Li Jiaxin (M/s Michael Por Law Corporation) for the \nApplicants \nMr Steven Lee (M/s Lee Chai & Boon) for the Respondents 2 \nSTB 61 OF 2013 - CASPIAN GROUNDS OF DECISION \n1. The Applicants are subsidiary proprietors of #XXX Caspian (the \u201cPremises\u201d) and the \nRespondents are the subsidiary proprietors of #XXX Caspian. The Applicants\u2019 unit is \nsituated directly above the Respondents\u2019.\n2. The present case is an unusual one. Typical cases concerning inter-floor leakage  \ninvolve water leakage that emanates from the unit directly above, causing damage to \nthe unit below. The presumption in Section 101(8) of the Building Maintenance and  \nStrata Management Act (BMSMA) (Cap. 30C) will then operate in presuming that the \napartment above is responsible for such a leak.\n3. However, in the present case, the moisture emerged on the floor of the Premises,  \nwhich had been attributed to the Respondents\u2019 tenants\u2019 prolonged use of their air -\nconditioning at unusually low temperatures directly below the Applicants\u2019 unit. The \nApplicants claimed that the Respondents\u2019 tenants\u2019 use of the air -conditioning had  \nresulted in condensation forming on the floor of the Premises, which ceased when \nthe tenants moved out. Therefore, in the present case, the presumption in Section \n101(8) would fail to apply as the moisture had not emanated from the unit directly  \nabove the Applicants\u2019. As such, the Applicants\u2019 had the burden of proving, on the \nbalance of probabilities, that the moisture that had caused damage to their  \napartment was reasonably attributed to the Respondents.\n4. In August 2013, the Applicants filed an application, complaining of mould and  \ndampness on the floor of the 3 bedrooms of the Premises. They claimed that the \ndamage had been due to the formation of condensation, which had formed as a result  \nof the excessive usage of the Respondents\u2019 air -conditioning system at very low \ntemperatures. The Applicants filed an application and sought to claim the cost of the \nfollowing:-\na)Replacement of damaged timber flooring in bedrooms;\nb)Mould inspection and remediation services;\nc)Treatment and repainting of walls and ceilings in bedrooms;3 \nSTB 61 OF 2013 - CASPIAN  d) Cost of damaged furniture and/or items;   \ne) Estimated rental to be incurred while the rect ification works are carried out; \nand \nf) Charges involve d in the filing of the application and any further professional \nfees to be incurred.  \n \n5. After 2 unsuccessful attempts to resolve the matter  through mediation , the dispute \nproceeded for a hearing.  \n \nBoth parties were represented by counsel. The Appl icants had two witnesses,  Doreen \nLee Eng Lin and their expert witness , Mr Kenneth Hugh Jones, a chartered surveyor. \nBoth the Respondents gave evidence, in addition to their expert witness, Mr Jeffrey \nToh Thye An.  \n \n \nTHE EVIDENCE  \n6. The Applicants gave evidence th at the damage caused to the Premises and their \nfurniture had been caused by the Respondents\u2019 tenant s\u2019 prolonged usage of their air \nconditioners  at low temperature s. They claimed that the concrete floor slab between \ntheir apartments had been cooled long enough for  condensation to form on the upper \nsurface when the moisture -laden air came into contact with the cold surface of the \nfloor. This  had resulted in the growth of mould on the floor of the Premises, which \nhad also spread to the Applicants\u2019 furniture and elect ronic items. The Applicants \nmaintained that they had done what they could to mitigate the condensation problem \nby mopping the floor to remove the water droplets and small puddles of water and \nmould which had coll ected in specific areas of the P remises.  \n \n7. The Applicants\u2019 main contention was that although there was no legally binding law \nor regulation in relation to the usage of air -conditioning, the Respondents had a duty \nto ensure that in using their air -conditioning, no loss or damage was caused to the \nprop erty of  their neighbours, who are equally entitled to enjoy their own property. It 4 \nSTB 61 OF 2013 - CASPIAN  was submitted that the Respondents\u2019 prolonged use  at a low temperature  of their air -\nconditioning had interfered with the Applicants\u2019 use and enjoym ent of the Applicants\u2019 \nPremises, as the Respondents\u2019 use of their air -conditioning in this allegedly \nunreasonable manner caused the wood rot and mould growth on the flooring of their \nPremises.  \n \n \nExpert Witness \u2013 Mr Kenneth Jones  (the \u201cApplicants\u2019 Expert\u201d)  \n8. The Applicant engaged Kenneth Jones, a Chartered Building Surveyor from the firm \nRobinson Jones Associated Pte Ltd in connection with the condensation . In his report \ntendered by him at the hearing he noted the following damage to the Applicant\u2019s \npremises.  \n \na) Moisture damage to varnish on timber strip flooring below the bed frame, and \nbetween the bed and the window of the Master Bedroom;  \n \nb) Presence of mould growth on the surface of the timber flooring strips in the \nMaster Bedroom, Bedroom 2 and Bedroom 3;  \n \nc) Localised detachment of pointing was observed on the floor of the Living \nRoom;   \n \n9. The Applicants\u2019 Expert  was engaged after the condensation in the Premises had taken \nplace,  and after the problem had ceased, as new tenants who had different living \nhabits had  moved into the Premises. Thus, h e was unable to determine the precise \ncondition s of the Premises that had led to the condensation at the material time.    \n \n10. However, it was his opinion that it was the Respondents\u2019 use of their air -conditioning \nwhich had cooled the concrete slab between the apartments. This in turn  caused a \ntemperature difference that resulted in condensation occurring on the parquet \nflooring. He concluded that as there could have been no other explanation, it was 5 \nSTB 61 OF 2013 - CASPIAN  reasonable to conclud e that the excessive moisture found in the Applicants\u2019 \napartment was due to the Respondent\u2019s excessive use of their air -conditioning.  \nRespondents \u2019 Evidence  \n11. Both  Respondents gave evidence. At the material time of the condensation, the \nRespondents\u2019 apartmen t had been occupied by tenants, who , as a result of the \ntensions arising from the condensation,  had since moved out . New tenants had since \nmoved in, which coincided with the time when the condensation problem in the \nPremises ceased.  \n \n12. The main thrust of th e Respondents\u2019  evidence was that the Applicants had \nunreasonably attributed the damage to the use of their air -conditioning unit.  They \nalso contended that there are no laws or regulations that restricted the use of their \nair-conditioning, as long as they used the air -conditioning  system  within the limits  of \nits design.  The Respondents gave  also evidence that they had taken all reasonable \nmeasures to try reach an amicable solution between the parties.  \n \n13. The Respondents contended that the Applicants had not taken efforts to eliminate all \nother possible causes for the damage suffered by the Applicants, and  questioned  the \nconclusion that it had been caused by the excessive use of the Respondents\u2019 air -\nconditioning , as it had been drawn many months after the cond ensation had \noccurred.  \n \n \nRespondents\u2019 Evidence \u2013 Jeffrey Toh  Thye An (the \u201cRespondents\u2019 Expert\u201d)  \n14. The Respondents engaged Jeffrey Toh  Thye An , a director of Vision Building Forensics \nPte Ltd.  \n \n15. The Respondents\u2019 Expert  was also engaged after the condensation in the Premises \nhad taken place, and he was consequently also unable to determine the precise 6 \nSTB 61 OF 2013 - CASPIAN  conditions of the Premises that had led to the condensation in the Applicants\u2019 \napartment.  \n \n16. In his report, the Respondent s\u2019 Expert  made the following observations:  \n \na) Mould typically accompanying condensation was not observed;  \nb) The timber parquet flooring did not appear to have been previously soaked or \ndampened by condensate water of the alleged condensation;  \nc) There were no obs ervations of warping, heaving or darkening of wood grains \ntypically associated with significant water damage to timber parquet flooring;  \nd) It could not be concluded that the discolouration of the flooring was solely due \nto the alleged condensation; and  \ne) The condition of the Premises was inconsistent with an environment with \nexcessive condensation.  \n \n17. He opined that in order for the alleged condensation to occur, the temperature \nsetting of the Respondents\u2019 unit had to be set at 18 degrees Celsius for more than 3  \ndays continuously such that the temperature of the concrete slab of 200mm thick  is \ncooled below the dew  point of about 21 degrees Celsius.  However, he noted that even \nwith an 18\u2070C setting, the ambient temperature of the Respondents\u2019 unit or the \nsurface of  the floor of the Premises could not attain a temperature of 18\u2070C due to \nconduction losses in construction material or heat gain at the external walls and \nthermal bridges such as windows and concrete ledges.  \n \n18. During cross -examination, the Respondents\u2019 E xpert  did not agree that the water \ndroplets that had formed as a result of the Respondents\u2019 use of their air -conditioning \nsystem. He was of the view that the evidence could not prove conclusively that the \nwater droplets that had formed in the  Premises were  as a result of the Respondents\u2019 \nuse of their air -conditioning system. His assessment was that it was not possible that \nthe prolonged use of the Respondents\u2019 air -conditioning system caused the excessive \ncooling of the concrete slab, which resulted in the c ondensation forming on the floor \nof the Premises.  7 \nSTB 61 OF 2013 - CASPIAN   \n19. He could not conclusively ascertain the cause of the water droplets without access to \nthe Premises at the material time of condensation. He indicated that measurement \ntests should have been done earlier . However, based on the evidence available to \nhim, he  was of the opinion that  it was not possible that the Respondents\u2019 use of their \nair-conditioning system could have been the cause of the damage in the Premises.   \n \n \nDECISION/ORDER  \n20. From the evidence adduced before the Board, it was clear that the Premises had \nsuffered damage. As to precisely what caused the damage  in the P remises , the Board \nwas unable to come to a definitive conclusion as both parties\u2019 experts did not have \nthe opport unity to inspect the Premises and record the precise conditions prevailing \nat the material time of the condensation.  Consequently, the  Board is unable to \nattribute all of the damage caused to the  Premises and furniture to the Respondents\u2019 \nuse of their air -conditioning unit.  \n \n21. However,  on the facts before the Board , and on a balance of probabilities, the Board \naccepts  that  the Applicant  has made out the case for the damage  to the areas  under \nthe beds in the three bedrooms in the Premises . There is corroborative evidence \nadduced, that at the material time when the condensation in these areas was most \npronounced , there was a combination of two factors viz. the lower surface \ntemperature and the lack of ventilation (as opined by Yang Architect s Pte Ltd \nexhibited at Annex D of the Applicants\u2019 Application).  \n \n \n22. Accordingly The Board  finds that the damage  to the floor in the areas under the beds \nin the three bedrooms  is on the balance of probabilities caused by condensation \nresulting from the mann er of use of the airconditioning system by the Respondent\u2019s \nformer tenant.   8 \nSTB 61 OF 2013 - CASPIAN   \n23. However even on the balance of probabilities, the Board is  unable, on the evidence \nbefore it, to conclude that the Respondents were responsible for the damage to the \nother areas o f the Premises where the alleged condensation on the floor was minimal.  \nThe Board is also of the view that the Respondents cannot be held responsible for \ndamage caused to the Applicants\u2019 furniture or appliances. These are movable  objects, \ndamage to them could not be conclusively attributed to the Respondents\u2019 use of their \nair-conditioning system.  \n \n24.     The Board is of the opinion that the rectification of the damaged  flooring can be carried \nout without the Applicants having to move out of the Premises,  and therefore the \nclaim for rental incurred while the rectification works are carried out will not be \ngranted.  \n \n25. After considering all the above, the Board  accepts  the evidence of the Applicant and \naccordingly  makes  the following orders:  \n \na. The Respondents  shall engage a contractor to carry out effective and proper \nrepairs to rectify the damage in the areas of the floor s of the bedrooms by \nreplacing the damaged timber flooring in the areas situated below the beds in \nthe bedrooms (the \u201cWorks\u201d).  \n \nb. In relation to (a) above, the  Respondents shall within 14  days, engage and pay \nany mutually acceptable experienced contractor to carry out the Works . \n \nc. The Respondents shall ensure that the Works are completed within two \nmonths of the Order herein.  \n 9 \nSTB 61 OF 2013 - CASPIAN d.In the event the Respondents fail to comply fully with any of the terms of this\nOrder, the Applicant may proceed to take all reasonable steps to give effect to\nthe same, and recover all costs incurred as a debt from the Respondents.\ne.The Board is of the opinion that parties shall bear their own costs as the\nApplicants failed to succeed on all of their claims.\nDated this 23rd day of  July 2014 \nMR ALFONSO ANG \nDeputy President \nMRS TAN SOOK YEE \nMember \nMR LEE KEH SAI \nMember "

In this application, Yap Sing Lee (Yap) the subsidiary proprietor of Blk 327 River\nValley Road #XXX Yong An Park applied, in addition for Costs and fees, for an \norder to invalidate the following resolution passed by The Management \nCorporation Strata Title Plan No 1267 (the MC) at the Extraordinary General \nMeeting (EOGM) held on 13 October 2012.\nResolution 3.0\nNo further action be taken by Council in respect of the roof structures at the \npenthouse and town house units, as set out in the URA and MND \nCorrespondence, unless otherwise empowered and authorized by theSTB 94 of 2012 \u2013 Yong An Park  Page 2 of 9 Management Corporation in a General meeting or if the Management \nCorporation is compelled by any demands, actions, claims and/or proceedings \nrelating to, arising from and/or in connection with the roof structures at the \npenthouse and town house units.  \n2. In the application form (Form 8) filed by Yap on 5 November 2012, there was an\napplication for another resolution (Resolution 5.0) to be invalidated. At a\nmediation/ direction hearing before the Board, Yap confirmed that he was not\nseeking the invalidation of that resolution.\nBACKGROUND:  \n3. From the Joint Statement of Background Facts (AB1) and Documents (AB2)\nsubmitted, the facts that led to the passing of the resolution were as follows:\n3.1  The penthouse and town house units in the resolution comprise 16\npenthouse units and 8 town house units in Blocks 325, 327, 329 , 331 and \n333 in Yong An Park. \n3.2  On 22 November 1996, the URA had, following an application by the MC, \nissued under S10(1) of the Planning Act Cap 232 1990 Ed, a Notice of \nGrant of Written Permission for Proposed addition and alterations to \nexisting condominium housing development on (the five abovementioned \nblocks) involving conversion of roof terraces to family hall and internal \nadditions/alterations\u2026.. (the 1996 WP) \nS 20(1) of the Planning Act inter alia  provides that \nevery planning permission and every conservation permission shall lapse if \nthe development or works authorized by it are not completed or effected \nwithin 2 years of the date of the grant of the planning permission or \nconservation permission  \n3.3  After the 1996 WP, the MC required the affected penthouse and townhouse \nowners to sign a Deed of Undertaking to agree to a common design and \nconstruction of the  proposed works to ensure uniformity. There was no \nconsensus on this. \n3.4  Alteration works were carried out at a number of units including Block 327 \n#XXX. The works were carried out without the approval of the MC and \nalthough  it is not known  when  they  were  carried  out, it is the case  for the \nMC that they were not carried out within the validity period of the 1996 WP. \n3.5  In March 2007, the MC issued a newsletter. Inter alia  the contents were as \nfollows: \nYong An Park has eight townhouse and 16 penthouse units. \n Several units contain addition and alteration works that were carried out \n from 1996 to 2003 without prior approval being obtained from the \n management corporation. Owners of three units have also recently applied STB 94 of 2012 \u2013 Yong An Park  Page 3 of 9 for additions and alterations to be carried out. These additions and \nalterations (A&A) if constructed or retained (as the case may be) consume \nYong an\u2019 gross floor area (GFA) \nThe subsidiary proprietors (SPs) of these three units are presently engaged \nin legal proceedings with the management corporation in connection with \nthese A&A \n\u2026 \n On 4 July 1996 the 9th Management Council approved the design of A&A \n for penthouse/townhouse and subsequently applied to URA for permission \nto carry out A&A for the penthouses/townhouses. On 22 November URA \ngranted approval with written permission lapsing on 22 November 1998 \nThe 10th MC decided that the management corporation would grant \npermission to the penthouses/townhouses for A&A to be carried only if all \nthe penthouse/townhouse SPs execute a Deed of Undertaking (Deed). The \nparamount objective of requiring all the penthouse/townhouse SPs to jointly \nagree to the terms of the Deed was to ensure consistency and uniformity of \ndesign of the A&A and not to compromise the fa\u00e7ade of the buildings in \nYong An Park. The penthouse SPs did not execute the Deed. Although the \nDeed was signed by the townhouse SPs the 10th MC did not issue written \napproval to the townhouse SPs to carry out A&A because 2 of the \ntownhouse SPs did not make the requisite deposits to the architect (as \nrequired under the terms of the Deed) \nSubsequent MCs from 1997 (10th MC) to 2005 (18th MC) took the approach \nthat council had no authority to approve A&A to the penthouses/townhouses \nwhere they involved the use of GFA of Yong An Park. \nYong An Park was built without fully utilising its GFA. However, if the \nunused GFA was used by SPs for their A&A, Yong An may be left with \ninsufficient GFA should the management corporation decide in future to \ncarry out upgrading works involving GFA (eg building of a clubhouse etc \n... \nAt the 18th AGM held on 15 January 2005 the managing agent briefed the \nmeeting on the status of unauthorised structures constructed within the SPs \nunits in Yong An Park. Members who attended the meeting were noted to \nhave raised various concerns over the existence of such structures. The \ndiscussion culminated with the meeting stating that \u201cthere was a strong \nconsensus at (the) meeting that such unauthorised structures and \nalterations must be addressed and removed\u201d \n\u2026 \n\u2026 \n\u2026 \n\u2026 STB 94 of 2012 \u2013 Yong An Park  Page 4 of 9 It is paramount that all SPs should now consider th e future of the \nunauthorised structures/alterations in the penthouse/townhouse. \nResolutions have been tabled at the forthcoming AGM which deals with \nthese issues \n3.6  On 28 June 2007, M/s Drew and Napier on behalf of the MC wrote to the \nURA. Inter alia , the letter referred to the 1996 WP; that upon the issuance of \nthe 1996 WP Yong An Park was deemed to have incurred additional GFA of \n1034.94 sq m (rising from 80041 sq m to 81075.94sq m); that there was no \ndevelopment charge incurred because the paid up GFA was 82,593.028; \nthe 1996 WP had lapsed without any of the approved works being carried \nout on the basis that the MC had not given any approval for any work \nbecause there was no consensus on the Deed of Undertaking; that some \nowners had proceeded to construct structures on their roof terraces without \nthe knowledge and permission of the MC (a table of the units involved was \nprovided); MC\u2019s view that these were illegal structures; referred to an \napplication by Yap, who had purchased his unit in or around March 2006, to \ncarry out extensive renovations on the basis of the 1996 WP; the MC\u2019s \nrejection of Yap\u2019s application because GFA was affected; Yap enclosing an \nemail from a Clement Lim from the URA informing that URA had no issue \nwith GFA because there was existing GFA from the approved roof terrace \nstructures which could be used to offset from and secure to his proposal; \nthe MC\u2019s view that URA\u2019s position that GFA had already been consumed by \nthe roof terrace constructed at Yap\u2019s unit was mistaken because as far as \nthe MC was concerned it was an illegal structure and could not be \nconsidered to have been installed in accordance with the 1996 WP; referred \nto an earlier stand taken by the URA involving another penthouse unit that \ndid not appear to be consistent with the stand in Yap\u2019s case; called upon \nthe URA to clarify the apparent contradiction. \n3.7  On 3 August 2007, Catherine Lau from URA replied and pointed out that the \nURA\u2019s dealings with Yap\u2019s and the other penthouse referred to by the MC \nwas not inconsistent. Inter alia , she informed that Yap\u2019s proposal did not \ninvolve additional GFA and that an additional GFA of about 10sqm was \ninvolved in the other. \n3.8  On 12 September 2007, the MC wrote to the URA to seek clarification in \nconnection with the Perspex cover in Yap\u2019s unit and inter alia  queried if the \nadditional 1034.94 GFA incurred by the issuance of the 1996 WP had \nreverted back to Yong An Park since (because the Deed was not signed) \nthe MC had not given any approval for work to be done in accordance with \nthe 1996 WP. On 27 September 2007, URA replied that the installation in \nYap\u2019s unit was in accordance with the 1996 WP and \u201cwe  do not see any \nissue of unconsumed GFA that need to be reverted back\u2026\u201d \n3.9  On 1 July 2008, the MC wrote to Mr Tan Tee How, Permanent Secretary of \nthe Ministry of National Development (PSND). Inter alia , the MC stated its \nposition that the installation in Yap\u2019s unit had been illegally installed; it STB 94 of 2012 \u2013 Yong An Park  Page 5 of 9 questioned URA\u2019s acceptance that it was rightly installed pursuant to the \n1996 Written Permission; repeated its query in connection with the 1034.94 \nGFA; repeated its position that the 1996 WP had lapsed without any A & A \nwork carried out; its view that A& A works that Yap was seeking to carry out \nwould incur GFA; that it was of the view that the position taken by URA was \n\u201c\u2026in error\u2026.\u201d; asked what action did URA intend to take in connection with \nstructures constructed without the MC\u2019s approval or written permission from \nURA \n3.10  On 26 August 2008, Ms Nonnie Thoo, Assistant Director/Strategic Planning, \non behalf of PSND replied and inter alia informed that the lightweight roof \nover the trellis at the unit known as Block 327#XXX was found to be \nerected in accordance with the WP ie at the same location and extent. The \nfact that not all the approved A&A works in the 1996 WP were carried out at \nthe subject unit does not render the erection of the lightweight roof cover \nunauthorised as there is no requirement under the Planning Act that all \nworks approved under a written permission must be carried out and \ncompleted. The MCST has claimed that the roof cover at the subject unit \nwas built outside the validity of the WP. Other than the reason that the \nMCST\u2019s requirements for the execution of the works had not been satisfied \nthere is no evidence substantiating this claim. As the roof cover was built in \naccordance with the 1996 WP and in the absence of evidence that the \nworks were carried out after the 1996 WP had lapsed, URA has no good \nreason to regard the roof cover as unauthorised for the purpose of the WP \nand Planning Act.  \n3.11  Ms Thoo went on to inform that proposed works in a fresh application (by \nYap) would not result in any increase in the total approved  GFA and in \naccordance with URA\u2019s submission guidelines the MC\u2019s endorsement (for \nYap\u2019s  application) was not required. Ms Thoo also referred to the MC \ninforming that MC\u2019s clearance had not been given to the SP\u2019s between \n1996 and 1998 to carry out A&A works and said We would like to stress \nthat the requirement for the SPs to obtain MCST\u2019s clearance under  the by-\n laws is a matter between the MCST and the SPs and failure to obtain such \nclearance does not render the works unauthorised under the Planning Act. \n4. Accordingly it can be noted that the views of the MC and URA/MND with regard\nto works carried out and GFA consumed following the 1996 WP were not\ncongruent. On the part of URA and MND, there were no unauthorised works\ncarried out following the 1996 WP and there was no issue with regard to\nunconsumed GFA because work in accordance with the WP had been carried\nout.\n5. It was under these circumstances that the EOGM was held on 13 October 2012.\nIt will be in order to set out that Resolution 3.0 was considered by the meeting\nonly after another resolution viz Resolution 2.0 was not carried. Resolution 2.0\ncalled upon the meeting to accept URA/MND\u2019s position and it was as follows:STB 94 of 2012 \u2013 Yong An Park  Page 6 of 9 To consider, and if thought fit, approve and resol ve by way of an Ordinary \nResolution  that: \n(a) URA\u2019s and MND\u2019s position in relation to the roof structure at the penthouse\nand townhouse units as set out in URA\u2019s email to Drew and Napier dated 27\nSeptember 2007 as well as MND\u2019s letter to Drew and Napier dated 26 August\n2008 be fully and unconditionally accepted by the management corporation Yong\nAn Park;\n(b) Council be empowered and authorised to execute all documents and do or\nprocure to be done all such acts and things as may be necessary in order to give\nfull and valid effect to the matters set out in the URA and MND correspondence;\n6. The voting on Resolution 2.0 was by poll. The total share value of votes cast was\n468 and the resolution was declared to be defeated after 450 representing\n96.15% voted against and 18 representing 3.85% voted in favour. The meeting\nhad accordingly rejected that the MC should fully and unconditionally accept the\nposition taken by URA and MND. After Resolution 2 was rejected, the meeting\nconsidered Resolution 3.0. There was no voting on the resolution because there\nwere no objections and the chairman declared \u201c\u2026that Resolution 3.0 is\nunanimously carried by this meeting, in other words, the floor has resolved that\nno further action will be taken by council in respect of the roof structures at the\npenthouse and townhouse units as set out in the URA and MND correspondence\nunless otherwise empowered and authorised by the MC in general meeting or\nunless the MC is compelled by demands, actions claims and/or proceedings\nrelating to, arising from and/or in connection with the roof structures at the\npenthouse and townhouse units.  With the rejection of Resolution 2.0 and the\npassing of Resolution 3.0, the state of affairs was that the MC did not accept the\nposition taken by URA and MND but would not be taking any action with regard\nto the roof structures at the penthouse and townhouse units referred to in the\ncorrespondence.  Hereinafter Resolution 3.0 will be referred to as R3.\nDECISION OF THE BOARD:  \n7. Yap has applied for R3 to be invalidated under the provisions of SS 103 and 104\nof the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act  Chapter 30C (the Act).\n8. S 103 of the Act provides for the invalidation of a resolution passed at a meeting\nwhere provisions of the Act were not complied with when the meeting was held.\nS 103 \u2013(1) Where pursuant to an application by a subsidiary proprietor or first\nmortgagee of a lot a Board considers that the provisions of this Act have not\nbeen complied with in relation to a meeting of the management corporation or\nsubsidiary management corporation, the Board may, by order \u2013\n(a) invalidate any resolution of or election held by the persons present at the\nmeeting; or\n(b) refuse to invalidate any such resolution.STB 94 of 2012 \u2013 Yong An Park  Page 7 of 9 9. It can be noted that the provision requires that one or more provisions of the Act\nhas/have not been complied with in relation to the meeting where the resolution\nwas  passed. Subsection (2) provides that an order to invalidate must be made\nwhen failure to comply had prejudicially affected another and compliance would\nhave resulted in a failure to pass the resolution. Where failure to comply had not\nprejudicially affected anyone or where compliance would not have resulted in a\nfailure to pass the resolution the Board can refuse to invalidate.\n10. S 104 of the Act provides for the nullification of a resolution where the Board is\nsatisfied that a particular resolution would not have been passed\u2026but for the fact\nthat the applicant (a) was improperly denied a vote...; or (b) was not given due\nnotice of the item of business pursuant to which the resolution was passed (ie the\napplicant had not been allowed to vote on the resolution and if he had been\nallowed to vote, the motion would not have been passed.)\n11. In Form 8 which was completed by Yap when he filed the application in this case,\nhe, with regard to SS 103 and 104 of the Act, referred to the notice that was\ngiven for the EOGM and it was his case that Paragraph 1(1) of the First Schedule\nof the Act had not been complied with because only 12 days instead of 14 days\u2019\nnotice had been given before the EOGM. In his Opening Statement (YSL1) and\nwritten Submission (YSL2), no reference was made to insufficient notice. It was\nnow his submission that R3 which was passed by way of an ordinary resolution\nwas not in order because a special resolution was required.\n12. Yap has, in his submissions, detailed interactions between him and the MC; and\nbetween the MC and other subsidiary proprietors. He also made submissions on\nhow  he had been adversely affected by the actions of the MC. Submissions\nwere also made in connection with advice given by the lawyer at the meeting\nbefore R3 was passed. The Board will not deal with these matters as the Board is\nof the view that they are not relevant.\n13. In his Reply Submissions (YSL 3), Yap referred to S 61(1) of the Act (the section\nprovides that a member of a council shall at all times act honestly and use\nreasonable diligence in the discharge of the duties of his office)  and submitted\nthat the MC had not acted honestly because, according to him, untrue statements\nhad been made in the 2007 newsletter.  A perusal of the newsletter (AB2 Tab 19)\nwill reveal that the MC had in the newsletter expressed its views with regard to\nadditions and alterations works consuming GFA and works carried out without\nthe approval of the MC are described as \u201cunauthorized\u201d. It appeared to be Yap\u2019s\nsubmission that if the subsidiary proprietors present at the EOGM on 13 October\n2012 had been informed of the untrue statements R3 would not have been\npassed. It is to be noted that the meeting was not concerned with the contents of\nthe 2007 newsletter and it is not the finding of the Board that there are untrue\nstatements in the newsletter. There is also no evidence that R3 would not have\nbeen passed if the meeting had been informed of what Yap considered to be\nuntrue statements and no evidence upon which a finding can be made that there\nwas dishonesty on the part of anyone including any member of the council.STB 94 of 2012 \u2013 Yong An Park  Page 8 of 9 14. For a motion to be decided by way of an ordinary resolution, 14 days\u2019 notice\nspecifying the motion must be given. It is not required that voting should be on a\npoll and only a simple majority is necessary. For special resolutions, 21 days\u2019\nnotice must be given. Voting has to be on a poll and at least 75% of the\naggregate share value of the lots must cast their votes in favour of the motion\n(SS 2(2) and 2(3) of the Act).\n15. S 32(3) of the Act provides that \u201c\u2026  a management corporation may pursuant to a\nspecial resolution make by-laws, or amend, add or repeal any by-laws made\nunder this section\u2026\u201d\n16. It was the submission of Yap that a special resolution was required because it\nwas his submission that R3 was a resolution that repealed another by-law viz\nClause 15.14 and Clause 15.16 of the Supplementary By-Laws of the MC.\n17. Clause 15.14 is concerned with the obtaining of written approval from the MC\nwith regard to installation of rooftop covers. It inter alia  provides for the timeline\nfor plans and details of proposed works; nature of materials used and manner of\ninstallation. Clause 15.16 provides that the MC \u201c\u2026shall not approve any\napplication for renovation works\u2026which affects the GFA and it shall be the onus\nof the subsidiary proprietor to obtain written confirmation that GFA has not been\naffected\n18. Yap had, on 11 August 2006, made an application (AB2 Tab 15) for A/A works at\nhis unit which were \u201c\u2026in  accordance with planning approval granted...\u201d under\nthe 1996 WP. It was stated in the letter of application that \u201c\u2026there will not be any\nincreased in GFA \u2026\u201d On 19 October 2012, Yap was, via an email from the MC,\ninformed that \u201c\u2026in view of the resolution that has been passed (R3) the Council\nis unable to grant any approval in respect of your roof terraces\u2026\u201d\n19. It was the submission of Yap that in relying on R3 to reject the application for his\nA/A works, R3 was a resolution that repealed Clauses 15.14 and 15.16 of the\nSupplementary By-Laws of the MC.\n20. It is not necessary for the Board in this case to comment and decide on whether\nthe passing of R3 prevented the MC from granting approval for Yap\u2019s application\nand it is also not necessary for the Board in this case to comment and decide if\nthe MC\u2019s decision to reject Yap\u2019s application was in order or otherwise. The MC\u2019s\ndecision to reject Yap\u2019s application was in \u201c\u2026 the exercise or performance of\u2026a\npower, duty or function conferred by this Act or the by-laws \u2026\u201d and any dispute\nbetween Yap and the MC with regard to this should be dealt with via an\napplication under S 101(1)(c) of the Act. The application in this case is not such\nan application. The application in this case is an application for the Board to\ninvalidate R3 on the ground that the provisions of the Act had not been complied\nwith when it was passed. It was submitted that there was breach of S32 (3) of the\nAct and the Board has to decide whether R3 is a resolution to \u201c\u2026 makes by-laws,\nor amend, add or repeal any by-laws \u2026\u201d It is clear that it is not such a resolution.\nR3 is not a resolution where a by-law is made; it is not a resolution where anSTB 94 of 2012 \u2013 Yong An Park  Page 9 of 9 existing by-law is amended, added or repealed. As noted earlier, it was a \nr\nesolution for the council not to take any action in \u201c\u2026 respect of the roof structures \nat the penthouse and town house units, as set out in the URA and MND \nCorrespondence, unless otherwise empowered and authorized by the \nManagement Corporation in a General meeting or if the Management \nCorporation is compelled by any demands, actions, claims and/or proceedings \nrelating to, arising from and/or in connection with the roof structures at the \npenthouse and town house units.\u201d  \n21. The Board is not satisfied that there are any grounds to order that R3 be\ninvalidated  and it is ordered that the applications in STB 94 of 2012 be\ndismissed.\n22.

This is an application by 20 subsidiary proprietors in the estate known as Parc Oasis for \norders with regard to the by -laws of the Management Corporation Strata Plan No 2054.  \nBackground:  \n2. Parc Oasis is an estate located at 35 -55 Jurong East Ave 1. There are 950 units in the \nestate and an equal number of parking lots.  \n \n3. Prior to 15/06/13 the applicable by -laws provided that subsidiary proprietors (SPs) who \nowned more than one vehicle could park their vehicles in the estate without having to \npay any parking charges. Ther e was however no automatic right to park the 2nd and 3rd \nvehicles in the parking lots. They had to, for their 2nd vehicle, apply for and be issued with \na parking label that was valid for 6 months; pay an administration fee of $5.00 and a \nrefundable deposit  of $200 for the parking label. The labels would be issued only if there \nwere parking lots available. Similarly for the 3rd vehicle, there was a need for an \napplication and administration fee, but the validity was for 1 month.  \n \n4. On the 15/06/13 at a general  meeting of the management corporation the by -laws in \nconnection with the parking of 2nd, 3rd and subsequent vehicles were, pursuant to a \nspecial resolution amended and now provided  \nA fee of $100 per month (excluding GST) shall be imposed on residents for parking of \nsecond vehicle and a fee of $150 per month (excluding GST) shall be imposed on \nresidents for parking of third and subsequent vehicles with effect from 1 July 2013; \npayment of which shall be made monthly in advance on the first day of each calend ar \nmonth without demand\u2026.  3 \n 5. S 32(3) of the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act Chapter 30C (the Act) \nprovides that it is only pursuant to a special resolution that by -laws may be made, \namended, added to, or repealed. A special resolution requires that notice of the motion \nmust be given at least 21 days before the meeting and a vote in favour of the motion  of \nat least 75% of the aggregate share value of all the lots (S 2(3) of the Act). In this case \n84.37% voted for the amendment.  \n \n6. Before the amendm ent of the by -law, the management council had in Nov 2012 informed \nall SPs of the estate that a review of the revenue and expenses of the estate revealed \nthat there would be a deficit of $117827.65 for financial year 2012 (01/07/12 -30/06/13). \nThere was a residents\u2019  forum held that same month and cost -cutting proposals were \ndiscussed. Charging for usage of facilities and payment for parking of second and \nsubsequent vehicles were among the proposals suggested.  On 12/01/13 there was a \nmotion to consider and a pprove by way of a special resolution that fees be imposed on \nresidents for the parking of second, third and subsequent vehicle s. SPs had been \ninformed that this was for the purpose of generating additional income to help in the \nfinancial situation and tha t this was one of many steps being taken to manage the deficit. \nThe resolution was not passed as the required percentage was not met (Whilst SPs with \nshare values total ling 73.18% of voted in favour of resolution this was short of the 75% \nrequired) . \n \n7. By wa y of a letter dated 22/05 /13 from the chairman of the management council, SPs \nwere inter alia informed that an EOGM was to be called to address a forecasted deficit of \n$353000 for the financial year commencing 01/07/13. The motion for the charging of \nparki ng fees was at item 3 of agenda of the 15/06/13 meeting. Item 4 was a motion for \ncontributions to the management fund to be levied. It was to be $59 per share value per \nmonth if the motion for the charging of parking fees was approved and if that was not \napproved then the amount was to be $64 per share value per month. The motion for the \ncharging of parking fees was approved and the resolution was, as noted above, passed \nwith a vote of 84.37% . \n \n8. In this application the applicants are, inter alia applying for  the by -law passed on the \n15/06/13 (the by -law) to be repealed and for the previous by -law to be reinstated. It is the \nsubmission of the applicants that under SS 101, 105, 106 and 118 of the Act the Board \ncan make the orders sought because the by -law is ul tra vires, oppressive and \ndiscriminatory.  \n \n9. Under S 101 of the Act a Board can make orders for the settlement of a dispute with \nrespect to the exercise or performance of or failure to perform a power, a duty or function \nconferred  or imposed by  the Act (S 101(1)(c) . \n \n10. Under S 105 of the Act the Board has the discretion to order an amended by -law to be \nrepealed and revive the by law that was revoked by the amended by -law when the Board \nconsiders this to be in the interests of all subsidiary proprietors.  \n \n11. Under S 106 the Board may declare a by -law to be invalid when the Board considers that \nthe management corporation did not have the power to make the by -law. 4 \n  \n \n12. Under s 118 the Board can, when there is a request for the making of an interim order, \nmake such an order when the Board is satisfied that there are urgent considerations \njustifying the making of an interim order. There was in this case no request for an interim \norder  \nDecision of the Board:  \n13. By-laws are statutorily constituted contrac ts between the manage ment corporation and \nthe subsidiary proprietors and between the subsidiary proprietors inter se (Choo Kok Lin \nv MCST Plan 2405 [2005] SGHC 144). They are intended for regulation of conduct and \nbehavior and it is clear from S32(3)(c) of the Act that the man agement corporation can \ninter alia make or amend a by -law for the purpose of controlling and managing the use of \nparking within the estate. The section is as follows:  \nS 32 (3)\u2026 a management corporation may, pursuant to a special resolution, make by -\nlaws or amend, add or repeal any by -laws made under this section for the purpose of \ncontrolling and managing the use and enjoyment of the parcel comprised in the strata \ntitle plan, including all or any of the following purposes:  \n \u2026 \n \n(d) parking  \n\u2026.. \n \n14. Ultra Vires:                                                                                                                     \n It Is the duty of a management corporation to control, manage and administer common \nproperty for the benefit of all the subsidiary proprieto rs (S 29 of the Act). Under the Act (S \n38 of the Act) management corporations are obliged to establish and maintain \nmanagement and sinking funds for the purpose of meeting liabilities and carrying out its \npowers, duties and functions.  \n \n15. It was the submission of the applicants that the by -law which was proposed and passed \nfor the purpose of addressing a financial deficit was ultra vires because management \ncorporations can raise funds only in accordance with S 39 of the Act.  \n \n16. Under S39 of the Act it is mandatory for a management corporation to from time to time \nat a general meeting, determine the amounts which are reasonable and necessary to be \nraised by contributions for the purpose of meeting its actual and expected liabilities in \nrespect  of matters listed at S39 (1) (a) to (d)  and S 39(2) (a) to (d).  \n \n17. S 39 is a provision with regard to the raising of contributions for the purpose of meeting \nactual and expected liabilities. The section is in connection with contributions from SPs \nand is not concerned with other means of raising funds to meet the expenses of the \nmanagement corporation. It does not provide that, other than contributions from SPs, \nmanagement corporations cannot raise funds by other means and there is nothing in the \nAct to suggest that Parliament intended that management corporations should be 5 \n allowed to raise funds only by way of contributions from SPs a nd not by any other \nmeans.  \n \n18. In this case the by -law provides for the payment of fees in connection with the parking of \nvehicles. It was submitted that other than fees prescribed in S 47 of the Act, \nmanagement corporations are prohibited from charging fees of any other matter.  \n \n \n19. S 47 of the Act is a provision with regard to the supplying of information specified in S \n47(1)(a) to (c) of the Act and the fees payable in connection with the provision of the \ninformation. There is no provision in the Act that pro hibits management corporations from \ncharging fees in connection services provided by the management corporation or for \nother matters (including fees for the use of various facilities in the estate)  \n \n20. Discriminatory:                                                                                                              \nS105 provides that a Board can repeal additional by -laws and amendments to existing \nby-laws and revive revoked by -laws after considering the interests of all subsidiary \nproprietors in the use and enjoyment of their lots or the common property. Clearly a by -\nlaw that is discriminatory in its application will qualify for repeal.  \n \n21. The applicants submitted that the by \u2013law is discriminatory in application because it \ntargets a specific class of s ubsidiary proprietors. The submission was that the by -law \nrequired SPs who owned two or more m/vehicles to pay additional contributions for the \nmaintenance of the estate. Does the by -law require this? Whilst no parking fees are \nlevied for the parking of on e or 1st vehicle , owners two or more vehicles are required to \npay fees for parking these vehicles on the common property of the estate. Owners of two \nor more vehicles are however not obliged to park their 2nd and 3rd vehicles in the parking \nlots of the est ate (it is a fact that there are parking lots available in the vicinity of the \nestate) and in this case will not be required to pay parking fees. Should they choose to \npark in the parking lots of the estate fees are chargeable and proceeds are used for the  \nmaintenance and upkeep of the estate.  \n \n22. Oppressive:        \nIt was submitted that the by -law was oppressive because alternative proposals submitted \nby the applicants were not adopted. The Board considered whether the by -law that \nrequired owners of two or mo re vehicles to pay parking fees if they wanted to park their \nsecond and third vehicles in the car parks in the estate could be viewed as one that was \nunfair to owners of two or more vehicles. From the equal number between parking lots \nand the units in the estate it would not be out of order to assume that the developers \nintended that there would be one parking lot for each and every unit. It was not the \nintention that more than one parking lot would be available for each and every unit. The \nBoard was of the  view that charging parking fees for the second, third and more vehicles \nwhen lots were available cannot be viewed as being unfair to owners of two or more \nvehicles especially when the fees collected are to be used for the benefit of all subsidiary \nproprie tors. It was a fact that the by -law was passed at a meeting of the management \ncorporation where all subsidiary proprietors including the applicants had a right to 6 \n address the meeting, and even before the meeting, the applicants could have done \nwhatever was  necessary to persuade the meeting to adopt their proposals. An \noverwhelming majority had voted in favour of the by -law (The respondents have in \nwritten submissions informed that the chairman of the management council and one \nother council member own more than one motorcar). The Board did not consider that the \nby-law was oppressive.  \n \n23. It was further submitted that the by -law was contrary to the law of tenancy in common. \nThe argument was that common property (ie the car parks) is owned by all subsidiary \nproprietors as tenants in common and as such they should not have to pay for the use \nand enjoyment of the car parks. The applicants referred to, inter alia Dennis v McDonald \n[1981] 1 WLR 810  where it was held that although a tenant in common was not liable to \npay an occupation rent where the other tenant in common voluntarily chose not to \nexercise the right of occupation, if the non -occupying tenant had been had been \nexcluded from the premises the courts would order payment of occupation rent if it was \nnecessary to do justice between the parties. The applicants referred to S 33 of the Act \nand submitted that this was the statutory equivalent of \u201coccupation rent\u201d. Unless there \nwas exclusive use of common property it was not in order for fees to be charged and no \nexclusive use was conferred in this case.  \n \n24. Under S 33 of the Act, a management cor poration can with the written consent of a \nsubsidiary proprietor make a by -law conferring exclusive use and enjoyment or special \nprivileges in respect of the whole or any part of common property. Where use and \nenjoyment or grant of special privileges is fo r a period of less than 3 years a special \nresolution is required and if more than 3 years then a 90% resolution is required.    \n \n25. The Board did not consider the by -law for the payment of fees for the parking of second, \nthird or more vehicles to be a payment  of \u201coccupation rent\u201d. Whilst car parks are common \nproperty and are owned by all subsidiary proprietors as tenants in common this does not \ndetract from the duty of a management corporation to control, manage and administer \ncommon property for the benefit o f all subsidiary proprietors ie in order to ensure that \nthere is orderly use and enjoyment of common property it will not be out of order to pass \nby-laws that spell out the conditions for the use of common property eg booking time \nlimits and the imposition  of fees.  \n \n26. The applicants concede that it is a common practice in other strata title plans to charge \nfor the parking of additional vehicles even when there are ample lots available and \nsubmit that  it would be credulous for the Respondents to suggest that s uch practices are \nnow accepted as lawful via acquiescence.  In response, the respondents referred to the \nremarks of Tay Yong Kwang J in ERA Realty Network Pte Ltd v Puspha Rajaram \nLakhiani and anor [1998]2 SLR(R) 721 at paragraph 21  \n \nWhere existing market practice is not contrary to public policy then the law should \nrecognize that market practice.  \n \n27. The Board does not consider that the charging of parking fees by a strata title plan is \ncontrary to public policy . 7 \n  \n28. S 38 of the Act provides for the establishmen t and maintenance of management and \nsinking funds for meeting actual and expected liabilities. The money that is to be paid \ninto the funds can originate from various sources. It can be noted that in addition to the \nsources listed in S 38(2) (a) to (e), S38 (5) (a) (b) and (d), money can be received from \nother sources (S38(5)(c))and this would include fees for the use of common property.  \n \n29. It was also submitted that the by -law should be repealed because the management \ncorporation when passing the by -law was a cting contrary to S 29 (1)(a) of the Act.  \n \n30. S 29(1)(a) of the A ct provides that it is the duty of the Management corporation to \ncontrol, manage and administer common property for the benefit of all subsidiary \nproprietors.  The submission of the applicants wa s that the by -law did not benefit all the \nsubsidiary proprietors but only befitted the majority who owned less than two vehicles. It \nwas not the view of the Board that the management corporation had, when passing the \nby-law breached its duty under S 29(1)( a) of the Act. Inter alia the by -law was passed so \nthat funds could be generated to meet liabilities and expenses arising from the \nmanagement corporation\u2019s duty to control, manage and administer the common property. \nA deficit of $353000 for the financial y ear commencing 01/07/13 had been forecasted \nand the fees collected could partially offset this deficit.

On 22 July 2013, the Applicant, a subsidiary pr oprietor in the Condominium filed \nan application (STB 52 of 2013) against the managem ent corporation and applied for \norders in connection with the proxy forms; resoluti ons proposed by the Applicant and for \nthe EGM to be declared null and void in the event t hat it was held before STB 52 of 2013 \nwas dealt with by the Board.  STB 52 of 2013 \u2013 Cashew Heights Condominium     Page 2 of 3 \n 3.  Following the mediation on 30 August 2013, the Applicant, via a letter dated 5 \nSeptember 2013 from his lawyer, informed that he wa s withdrawing STB 52 of 2013 \u201c with \neach party bearing its own costs, if any\u201d .  The Respondent via a letter dated 6 September \n2013 from their lawyers informed that at the mediat ion they had indicated that they would \nbe claiming for costs and requested that the matter  proceed for hearing for the Board to \nmake a decision on costs.  \n4.  Sometime before 11 September 2013, the Applican t informed that he was \nprepared to pay costs of $1000. This was not accept able to the Respondents who \nwanted costs on an indemnity basis. The Applicant w as not agreeable to paying costs on \nan indemnity basis. \n5. Via a letter dated 11 September 2013, the lawyer  for the Applicant informed that \nhe had been discharged by the Applicant and that th e Applicant would be representing \nhimself before the Board. The only issue outstandin g between the parties was the issue \nof costs. \n6.  Via a letter dated 12 September 2013, the lawye r for the Respondent informed \nthat the Respondents were prepared to settle the ma tter amicably subject to the \nApplicant paying costs of $1000 and in addition to this required that the Applicant issue a \nwritten apology \u201c\u2026upon such terms as are satisfactory\u2026such apology to be posted on \nthe Notice board at the Condominium for a period of  30 days\u2026\u201d \n7.  The matter was not resolved and an arbitration hearing was scheduled for the \nparties to make their submissions on costs. \n8. It was the submission of the Respondents that co sts in the sum of $3500 should \nbe awarded against the Applicant. Inter alia, STB 3 8 of 2011 was cited as a precedent. In \nthat case, there was a full hearing after the Respo ndent had refused to accept that he \nwas responsible for damages caused to the Applicant  and had indicated that he was not \nwilling to settle in any way. The Board did not con sider that it would be useful to refer to \nthe amount awarded in that case. \n9. It was the submission of the Applicant that no o rder for costs should be made. \nReference was made to the events following the fili ng of the application and previous \ncases before the Board where no orders for costs we re made.  \n10. The general principle for awarding costs is com pensation for the successful \nlitigant. What has to be compensated is time and ex penses necessarily incurred. \n11.  In this case the nature of the application was  such that the Applicant without any \nundue delay acknowledged that there was hardly any scope for success in pursuing with \nthe application. Notice that he was withdrawing his  application was given after the first \nmediation.  An offer was made to pay costs of $1000  after the Respondents informed that \nthey intended to claim for costs. STB 52 of 2013 \u2013 Cashew Heights Condominium  Page 3 of 3 12. After taking into account the nature of the application and work done for the filing\nof the submission (on 21 August 2013) disapproving the application, the Board is of the\nview that a fair and reasonable amount for costs would be $1000 and it is ordered that\nthe Applicant should pay costs fixed at $1000.\n13. In connection with an arbitration hearing before the Board, a fee of $300 is\npayable for each day or part thereof [The Schedule  of the Building Maintenance and\nStrata Management (Strata Titles Boards) Regulations 2005], the Board is of the view\nthat this matter could have and should have been resolved without the need for a\nhearing.\n14.

Mr Yap Sing Lee (Yap) is the subsidiary proprietor of a penthouse unit in Blk 327 \nRiver Valley Road #XXX Yong An Park (Blk 327). He purchased the unit in or \nabout March  2006.\n2. On 19th September 2012, Yap (in STB 77 of 2012) applied for the following orders \nagainst Management Corporation Strata Plan No. 1267 (MCST):\nTo order the Respondent (MCST) to accept the rights of, and/or grant consent to \nthe Applicant\u2019s following alterations and additions made to the rooftop and/or the \ncommon properties of the building:-\n(a) Relocation of the ventilation stacks approved by the PUB;\n(b) Addition of lightning protection systems to the existing lightning protection \nsystem; andSTB 77 & 95 of 2012 \u2013 Yong An Park     Page 2 of 18 \n (c) Installation of air condition condensers.  \n3. STB 95 of 2012 which was filed on 8 th  November 2012 mirrors STB 77of 2012 in \nthat the Applicant here is the MCST. Orders were so ught against Yap requiring \nhim to reinstate at his own costs:  \na) the ventilation stacks which currently terminate at  the rooftop of Block 327 to \ntheir original condition ;   \nb) that Yap removes, at his own costs, the unauthorized additions to the  \nlightning protection system at the rooftop of Block  327 and reinstate the \nlightning protection system to its original conditi on ; and  \nc)   that Yap removes, at his own costs, the unauthorized air conditioning  \ncondenser units located at the rooftop of Block 327  and reinstates the rooftop \nto its original condition . \n4. The applications were made under SS 101(1) and 1 11(a) of the Building \nMaintenance and Strata Management Act (Chapter 30C)  (the Act).  \nBACKGROUND:  \n5. Blk 327, including the rooftops is 27 floors in height with 24 floors consisting of 3 \nstrata  lots on each floor from the 2 nd  floor to the 25 th  floor. There are 3 duplex \npenthouses with each unit occupying the lower floor  at the 25 th  floor and the upper \nfloor at the 26 th  floor of the building. The rooftops of the respect ive penthouses are \nat the 27 th  floor. \nTHE VENTILATION STACKS (VS): \n6. The VS provide ventilation for the sanitary syst em for the units in each block. \nThere are 5 VS in each strata lot and the VS are lo cated within the service ducts of \nthe buildings. The service ducts run through the va rious units of the building [Note: \nWhereas YSL4 p23 clearly shows V1 to V4 ventilate t he 4 toilets (i.e., the sanitary \nsystem), there is no information on what the 5th  pipe serves] \n7. The VS in Blk 327 were designed and built on or before 1986, i.e.  before the \nSingapore Standard Code of Practice: Sewerage and S anitary Works (SS \nCP:SSW) came into force in the year 2000. Pursuant to Clause 3.2.3.[g] of SS \nCP:SSW, since February 2001, the Public Utilities B oard (PUB) no longer allows \nVS to be terminated in the private roof area that a re designed for use by the \noccupants. \n8. In a letter dated 8 th  April 2006, Yap sought the MCST\u2019s consent to insta ll filters to \nthe ventilation pipes and/or for the relocation of the VS. In his letter, Yap referred \nthe MCST to Clause 3.2.3.4[g] of SS CP: SSW that th e VS were no longer allowed \nto be terminated in the private roof terrace of a u nit. \n9. There was no written response from the MCST to t he request.  \n10. It is the case for the MCST that Yap was verbal ly informed that his request for \nrelocation was not approved. (There are no particul ars as to who informed Yap \nand when the information was conveyed). STB 77 & 95 of 2012 \u2013 Yong An Park     Page 3 of 18 \n 11. By way of a letter dated 11 th  June 2007, Yap\u2019s lawyers (M/s Allen and Gledhill) \nreminded the MCST of its non-response to Yap\u2019s lett er dated 8 th  April 2006 to the \nMCST and informed the MCST that due to the MCST not  responding, Yap had \nrequested for consent from the PUB for the VS to be  re-located. \n12. By a letter dated 13 th  June 2007 from the PUB addressed to a Choi Wai Ha (the \nletter was copied to the MCST), Yap was informed by  the PUB that: PUB had no \nobjection to the proposed diversion of four nos.(4)  150mm diameter stack as \nshown in your attached drawings ; the works must be carried out in strict \ncompliance with the SS CP:SSW; and Yap was informed  to  \n\u201cPlease also get the consent from the owner/ Manage ment Corporation on your \nproposal\u201d  \n13. On 20 th  June 2007, M/s Allen & Gledhill (A&G) wrote to the  MCST, enclosing the \nPUB\u2019s letter dated 13 th  June 2007, and sought the MCST\u2019s consent to Yap\u2019s \nproposal to relocate the VS. \n14. On 27 th  June 2007, the MCST, by way of a letter from Drew and Napier LLC \n(D&N), inter alia  replied, as follows:  \nIt is not clear from either your client\u2019s letter da ted 8 April 2006 or your recent letter \nas to where exactly your client is proposing to rel ocate the ventilation stack. In \naddition, neither your client\u2019s letter 8 April 2006  or your recent letter addresses the \nissue of costs and maintenance, and the issue of po tential liability for any defects \nor damages caused by or arising from the relocation  of the ventilation stack, \nparticularly after a change of ownership of your cl ient\u2019s unit. \n First if your client is proposing to terminate the  ventilation stack at the common \n roof on the 27 th  level, our client will require your client to bear  all costs of \n relocation, including the costs of reinstating the  waterproofing membrane on the \n 27 th  floor and maintaining the ventilation stack and wa terproofing membrane at the \ncommon roof. \n Secondly our client is very concerned to ensure th at your client and his \nsuccessors-in-title are all bound to indemnify the MCST for any potential liability \nfor any defects or damage  caused by or arising fro m the relocation of the \nventilation stack, and in particular to address the  possibility of water leakage \naround the areas of the relocated ventilation stack  \n15. By a letter dated 28 th  June 2007, A&G replied and informed that Yap is am enable:  \na)  to bear all the costs of the relocation as well as to make good the water \nproofing membrane(s) affected by the relocation;  \n b)   in line with the normal defect warranty period of t he construction industry, \nprovide a full indemnity to the MCST in relation to  the maintenance of the \nwater proofing membrane(s) affected by the said rel ocation, as well as all \ndefects or damages caused by and/or arising from th e relocation, for a period \nof 1 year up to the sum of $50,000; and  \nc)   as a gesture of our client\u2019s sincerity to furn ish a refundable interest free \n deposit of $5,000 to the MCST as a surety for the maintenance of the water \n proofing membrane(s) affected by the relocation fo r a period of 3 years . \n\u2026\u2026 STB 77 & 95 of 2012 \u2013 Yong An Park     Page 4 of 18 \n Further, in relation to your client\u2019s query as to t he position(s) from and to which our \nclient is intending to relocate the ventilation sta cks, we are instructed to inform that \nyour client is welcome to visit our client\u2019s unit w hereupon our client and/or his \nrepresentative will be pleased to show the exact sa id positions for the said \nrelocation. In this regard, please contact our clie nt directly to make the necessary \nappointment(s). \n16. It is the case for the MCST that on or about 28th  September 2007, the MCST \n replied to the letter dated 28 th  June 2007 and proposed to seek professional \n assistance from two building surveyors, namely, CS  Lee & Associates and Faithful \n + Gould Pte Ltd, to clarify the technical issues r elating to Yap\u2019s proposed \n relocation of the VS. The MCST also proposed that Yap bears the cost of the \n building surveyors\u2019 services in the sums of $1,500  and $2,800 respectively.  \n17. It is Yap\u2019s case that the MCST never responded to the 28 th  June 2007 letter. \nAccordingly, he did not respond to the proposals.  \n18. It is the case for the MCST that the minutes of  the Fifth and Sixth Council\u2019s \nmeeting state that the letter was sent to Yap.  \n19. The minutes do not confirm that such a letter w as sent. What is recorded in the \nminutes of the Fifth Council\u2019s meeting on 6 th  September 2007 is:  \nThe LSC ( legal subcommittee ) reported that in the meeting the LSC had with the  \nsolicitors on the 17August 2007, the solicitors adv ised that the MC should refer the \ndetails of the undertaking provided by the Subsidia ry Proprietor in consideration of \nhis application to carry out works affecting common  property to a qualified person \nas a building surveyor for their professional opini on. The MA reported that they \nhave obtained two proposals from two building surve yors and circulated the \nproposals to the LSC prior to the meeting. The Coun cil decided that the proposals \nshould be considered by the Subsidiary Proprietor a nd that it would only be fair \nthat the costs associated with the engagement of th ese professionals be borne by \nthe SP as part of the SP\u2019s costs to carry out the w orks affecting common property. \nThe MA noted the instruction and will communicated the Council\u2019s decision and \nproposal to the SP.  \n20. In the minutes of the Sixth Council\u2019s  meeting held on 5 th  November 2007, it is  \nrecorded that:  \nMA to remind D&N to expedite on the reply to YSL on  his application to reposition \nvent pipes and others...  \n21. It is not known and there is nothing to show th at the MA had in fact reminded D&N . \n22. On 26 th  July 2007, Yap sent an email to the MCST wherein h e inter alia  referred to \nthe non-receipt of an official reply to his applica tions with regard to relocation of \nthe VS and placement of the air con condenser (ACC)  over my roof top and \nrepeated his application with regard to the VS and ACC. Inter alia  the email was \nas follows:  \n...I am prepared to settle this amicably with you a nd forgo my claim against you in \n court for your failure to respond to my amended ap plication to you on the 13 th  \n November if you would consider the following: STB 77 & 95 of 2012 \u2013 Yong An Park  Page 5 of 18 1. grant me the consent to relocate the ventilation stacks as proposed with 3\nyears warranty.\n2. give me the approval to place the air conditioner units over my roof top in\nreturn for my proposal to maintain the roof top at my own costs\n3. each party to bear their own costs in the STB 10 of 2007 case which I have\nwithdrawn in preparation to continue the case in court\nI shall further delay the commencement of my A/A from 30th July 2007 to the 6th \nAugust for one last time.....  \n23. On 30th July 2007, Yap was informed that his email had been forwarded to the \ncouncil of the MCST.\n24. On the same day, Yap reminded the MCST of the urgency to consider granting \npermit to allow him to commence his A&A works as his A&A had been delayed for \nover a year.\n25. On 31st July 2007, Yap was given approval for removal of existing belongings.\n26. By way of a letter dated 23rd August 2007, there was a request from Yap with \nregard to \u201cproposed Air Con Condenser Location\u201d, \u201cProposed Exhaust pipes \nLocation\u201d and \u201cProposed Awning Location\u201d.\n27. Yap informed (S/No.:60 of the consolidated statement of facts (AB1)) that this was \nan alternative to the initial request with regard to the ACC made in a letter dated \n19th June 2007 sent by A&G (Tab 53 of AB2). It is the case for Yap that there was \nno written response to the request but that in Sept 2007 he was informed by the \ncondominium manager, Steve Teo that the alternative requests with regard to\n\u201cProposed Air Con Condenser Location\u201d, and \u201cProposed Exhaust pipes Location\u201d \nwere approved. At this time he was also informed that his applications with regard \nto the VS and ACC (submitted in a letter dated 19th June 2007) were not approved \nby the council because of \u201cconstraint of the Act\u201d and it was suggested that he \nshould table an exclusive use resolution in the general meeting.\n28. It is the case for Yap that in late 2007, Steve Teo informed him that the MCST had \nallowed him to commence all A&A work including relocation of VS and installation \nof ACC (Whilst this is not agreed by the MCST, it is noted in AB1 that the MCST \ndoes not dispute this - S/No.:69))\n29. The following was recorded at the Seventh Council\u2019s meeting on 27th December \n2007:\nAs for the owner\u2019s application for relocation of the vent pipe the council decided \nthat it  would be tabled at the EGM to seek general approval as this involves the \ncommon property\n30. On 21st January 2008, Yap requested for the following motion to be included in the \nagenda for the next EGM or AGM whichever was earlier:\nTo consider and approve through a 90% resolution for an addition to the by-law to \ngrant the subsidiary proprietor (SP) of Blk 327 #XXX the perpetual exclusive use \nand enjoyment of the common roof top directly above the SP\u2019s unit and upon the \nSP agreeing at the SP\u2019s own costs and expenses, to maintain and assume fullSTB 77 & 95 of 2012 \u2013 Yong An Park     Page 6 of 18 \n responsibilities and liabilities for the rooftop in definitely, including any leakage or \nflooding from the said rooftop into the SP\u2019s own un it and/or into the neighbouring \nunits and/or into the common properties  \n31. At the EOGM on 15 th  March 2008, the resolution was not carried. \nTHE LIGHTNING PROTECTION SYSTEM (LPS): \n32. A LPS is installed in every block and its purpo se is to protect the building. \n33. It is not in dispute that there was no written (formal/official) application by Yap for \nany work to be done to the LPS. \n34. It is the case for Yap that the LPS installed a t his block is inadequate and does not \ncomply with the Code of Practice for Lightning Prot ection  (CP 33:1996).  MCST \ndoes not dispute this and informs that CP 33:1996 w as not in force when the \ndevelopment was built.  \n35. Yap had also noted that over the years the MCST  had carried out numerous \nrepainting works and repeatedly painted thick layer s of acrylic paint over the air \nterminals and from the information in SS CP33:1996,  he was of the view that this \nhad damaged the conductibility of these air termina ls and affected its ability to \nattract lightning discharge and therefore damaged i ts function to protect the \nbuilding from being struck by lightning.  \n36. It is the case for Yap that in late 2007, he in formed Steve Teo that he would be \ninstalling, inter alia  a lightning protection device and that it would be  in accordance \nwith rules and regulations of the authorities. Stev e Teo verbally allowed him to \nproceed. (In AB1, MCST does not dispute this \u2013 S/No .:76 to 78) \n37. Yap did not make any application to modify the LPS and proceeded to modify the \nportion affecting his unit.  \n38. As far as the MCST was concerned, they were unc lear if the entire LPS is \nfunctioning properly and wanted endorsement from a qualified person. \n39. When A&A works were being carried out by Yap, t he MCST\u2019s security guards \nconducted inspections and took photos of the work b eing carried out; Yap\u2019s \ncontractors booked and made payments for exclusive use of the fireman\u2019s lift for \nthe A&A works and after Steve Teo ceased connection  with the MCST, the new \ncondominium manager allowed Yap to carry on with an d complete the A&A and \nrelocation of the VS was completed in early 2008 (I n AB1, MCST does not dispute \nthis \u2013 S/No.:78 of AB1)  \n40. All work in connection with the VS, the LPS and  the ACC was completed before \n15 th  March 2008. \n41. Yap has pointed out that when any work is carri ed with the approval of relevant \nauthorities, the authority will require certificati on that the work has been carried out \nin accordance with the approved plans. Accredited C lerk of Works has to be \nengaged to inspect the work during the A&A.  STB 77 & 95 of 2012 \u2013 Yong An Park  Page 7 of 18 42. Exhibited at Tab 46 in AB2 is a Certificate of Supervision of Lightning Protection \nSystem dated 8th April 2008, signed by a Professional Engineer licensed by PUB \ncertifying that:\nI have supervised the installation of the lightning protection system; and the design \nand installation of the lightning protection system are in accordance with the Code \nof Practice on Lightning Protection in Buildings \u2013SS CP 33:1996 [In addition, YSL4 \npage 28 is an additional certification dated 2nd April 2013 by the same PE that the \nexisting LPS of Blk 327 and the entire condo is not compromised by the LPS A&A \nat unit #XXX]\n43. By way of letters dated 25th March 2008 and 2nd April 2008, MCST notified Yap that \nthe relocation of the VS constituted a breach of the Act and/or by-laws and asked \nhim to reinstate the VS to its original condition; reinstate original LPS and remove \nACC from rooftop.\n44. By way of two letters dated 4th April 2008 and 7th April 2008, Yap replied that: With \nregard to the LPS he had buried and concealed the exposed conductor without \nmaking any changes to the original conductor and a more advanced lightning \nprotection device is used to provide a lightning protection to my roof terrace as well \nthe whole building, which makes it a safer place to live in in compliance with the \nnew SS CP33:1996.and he informed that a certificate certifying that the lightning \nprotection device complied with the latest SS\nCP33:1996, would be issued within the next two weeks (Tab 46 in AB2)\n45. With regard to the ACC, he had sought approval for installation on 18th June 2007 \nand MCST had not replied. He had then commenced installation of the ACC at the \ncommon rooftop and inter alia said that others had been allowed to so install. \nInstallation of the ACC involved extensive infra-structure works and removal would \nimpose great financial costs without benefit to anyone. The installation of the ACC \ndid not affect facade, or normal enjoyment of other subsidiary proprietors.\n46. With regard to the VS, he had sought approval for relocation on 8th April 2006. \nThere was no reply until 27th June 2007. The reply then dealt with costs and \nliability and he had replied on 28th June 2008 offering to absorb costs and liability. \nThere was no reply to this.\n47. The original termination points of the VS which were built in accordance with Code \nof Practice on Sanitary Plumbing and Drainage System in force in 1986 posed a \nhealth hazard and in view of the non-receipt of a response to the application for \napproval for relocation, he had proceeded with relocation as approved by PUB and \nthis was done by a competent licensed plumber recognised by PUB. Yap went on \nto say that the re-location of the VS was in accordance with the provisions of \nparagraphs 5(3)(c) and 5(4) of the By-Laws in the 2nd Schedule of the Building \nMaintenance (Strata Management) Regulations 2005.\nTHE AIR CON CONDENSER (ACC): \n48. ACC are installed within the premises of the various units\n49. The roof at each block is accessed through scaling through the unit\u2019s roof terrace.STB 77 & 95 of 2012 \u2013 Yong An Park     Page 8 of 18 \n 50. By a letter dated 19 th June 2007 sent by A&G, Yap applied for approval to install \nhis ACC units at the roof of Blk 327. The MCST by w ay of a letter dated 27 th  June \n2007 from D&N replied that installation of the ACC units at the roof constituted \nexclusive use and enjoyment of common property and that the MCST was unable \nto grant approval without a 90% resolution passed a t a general meeting. \n51. By way of a letter dated 28 th  June 2007 from A&G Yap inter alia pointed out that  \nthe roof is accessible to authorised maintenance pe rsonnel and is not accessible \nfor common use of the residents. Yap also pointed o ut the benefits to the MCST \nas follows:  \n\u2026In the circumstances the proposed relocation of ou r client\u2019s air-conditioning \ncondenser units would grant the MCST as well as Yon g An Park the cost benefits \nof our clients undertaking to maintain the portion of the roof top common area \ndirectly above his unit at his own expense\u2026.  \n52. Without written approval from the MCST, (as set  out above it is the case for Yap \nthat in late 2007 Steve Teo had informed him that t he MCST had allowed him to \ncommence all A&A work including relocation of VS an d installation of ACC) Yap \ninstalled the condenser piping running from within the strata boundary of his unit \nand terminated at the wall of the roof of the unit where the ACC are installed.   \n53. The installation cannot be seen from anywhere w ithin the estate i.e.  is not visible \nexcept from overhead. Work was completed before 15 th  March 2008. \n54. At a council meeting on the 6 th  October 2008 (Tab 60 in AB2), it was agreed that \nthe MCST would apply to the STB for an Order under Part VI to let the Board \ndecide if the Management Corporation should allow ( Yap) to maintain the common \nroof directly above his unit and around the relocat ed ventilation stacks at his own \ncosts and expenses or whether he should reinstate t he alterations and additions \ncarried out at the common property at his own cost.   \n55. This did not come to pass because Yap was, by w ay of a letter dated 7 th  October \n2008, informed that his proposal to maintain the co mmon roof is to enjoy exclusive \nuse of the common area for an indefinite period\u2026. and he was invited to table a \nprivate requisition at the next AGM to seek the man date from the general body on \nthe exclusive use of the common property.  \n56. Yap responded by way of a letter dated 20 th  October 2008 that he had no desire or \nwish to seek exclusive use from the general body as in practice it can only be \naccessed and used exclusively by my unit only a nd went on to ask I need to know \non an urgent basis whether the MCST is proceeding t o maintain the roof top or I \nshould do the maintenance. There was no response from the MCST to this letter  \nBOARD\u2019S FINDINGS:  \n57. Before deciding on the respective applications of Yap and the MCST, it will be in \norder that we set out our findings as to how the VS  came to be relocated; the LPS \nmodified and the ACC installed on the roof. \n58. To fully appreciate what exactly was involved i n the relocation and installation of \nthe VS, the LPS and ACC, we visited Yap\u2019s unit and viewed the installations. We STB 77 & 95 of 2012 \u2013 Yong An Park  Page 9 of 18 also visited the unit next door to view the original location of the VS. Photographs \ntaken by Board members during the visit are exhibited at BP1 to BP48.  \n59. There are three penthouses at the upper most levels of Blk 327 (see pg 19 of YSL\n4)and they occupy two levels. YSL4 pages 7 to 16 show that Blk 327 is a point \nblock of apartments.  A lift and staircase core is located centrally in the block and is \ntopped by the lift motor room and water tanks and covered by an angled roof.  A \ntwin stack of adjoining apartments is attached to one side of this access core and a \nthird stack of apartments is attached to the other side.  Yap's penthouse (unit\n#XXX) and his adjoining neighbouring penthouse (unit #XXX) together top the twin \nstack whilst unit #XXX tops the other stack.  Each penthouse occupies two levels.  \nThe Board visited units #XXX and #XXX.\n60. The upper floor of each penthouse is at the 26th level.  It partly comprises a large \nopen roof terrace and partly built-in living space that is roofed over by a flat roof at \nthe 27th level.  This flat roof over the adjoining units #XXX and #XXX is one \ncontinuous, integral roof slab and abuts the lift/staircase core.  The flat roof over \n#XXX similarly abuts the lift/staircase core on the opposite side.  There is no direct \naccess from the lift/staircase core to the 27th level flat roofs.\n61. The roof terraces and flat roofs are bordered by a parapet.\n62. The flat roof above the upper level of unit #XXX is accessible by way of spiral \nstairway from the roof terrace. The spiral stairway (BP10) was installed by Yap. It \ndid not appear that the developer had intended for the flat roof to be accessible \nfrom the roof terrace as during the site visit we were not able to access the flat roof \nof unit #XXX when we visited that unit.\n63. In the written submissions, references were made to \u201croof tops\u201d without reference \nto whether this referred to the flat roof or the angled roof. The Board is of the view \nthat the use of the word \u201croof top\u201d may cause confusion and will use the words \u201cflat \nroof\u201d and \u201cangled roof\u201d when referring to the respective roofs.\nTHE VENTILATION STACKS (VS): \n64. The VS in Blk 327 were designed and built on or before 1986, i.e. before the\nSingapore Standard Code of Practice: Sewerage and Sanitary Works (SS\nCP:SSW) came into force in 2000. Pursuant to Clause 3.2.3.[g] of SS CP:SSW,\nsince February 2001, the PUB no longer allows VS to be terminated in the private\nroof area that are designed for use by the occupants.\n65. In April 2006, Yap sought the consent of the MCST to relocate the VS. For more\nthan 12 months, the MCST did not respond to Yap\u2019s letter and on 11th June 2007,\nYap\u2019s lawyers reminded the MCST of its non-response and informed that Yap had\nrequested for consent from the PUB for relocation of the VS.\n66. On 13th June 2007, PUB informed Yap that it had no objections to Yap\u2019s proposal\nand at the same time Yap was informed by PUB to get the consent of the\nowner/MCST. Yap then through his lawyers sent the letter from the PUB to the\nMCST and sought consent to relocate the VS.STB 77 & 95 of 2012 \u2013 Yong An Park     Page 10 of 18 \n 67. On the 27 th  June 2007, the MCST inter alia informed Yap that i f he was proposing \nto terminate the VS at the common roof he would be required to i) bear all costs of \nrelocation, including the costs of reinstating the waterproofing membrane on the \n27 th  floor and maintaining the ventilation stack and wa terproofing membrane at the \ncommon roof; and ii) to ensure that Yap and his suc cessors-in-title are all bound to \nindemnify the MCST for any potential liability for any defects or damage caused by \nor arising from the relocation of the ventilation s tack, and in particular to address \nthe possibility of water leakage around the areas o f the relocated ventilation stack. \n68. Yap confirmed that he was prepared to bear all the costs of the relocation as well \nas to make good the water proofing membrane(s) affe cted by the relocation; in line \nwith the normal defect warranty period of the const ruction industry, provide a full \nindemnity to the MCST in relation to the maintenanc e of the water proofing \nmembrane(s) affected by the said relocation, as wel l as all defects or damages \ncaused by and/or arising from the relocation, for a  period of 1 year up to the sum \nof $50,000; and to furnish a refundable interest fr ee deposit of $5,000 to the MCST \nas a surety for the maintenance of the water proofi ng membrane(s) affected by the \nrelocation for a period of 3 years. \n69. There was no response from the MCST to Yap\u2019s of fer until 30 th  July 2007 when \nYap was informed his email dated 26 th  July 2007 which inter alia referred to the 3 \nyears warranty had been forwarded to the council of  the MCST. \n70. In September 2007, Yap was informed by the cond ominium manager that his \napplications in connection with the VS and the ACC were not approved because of \n\u201cconstraints of the Act \u201d and it was suggested to him that he table an excl usive use \nresolution in the general meeting (Under S 33 of th e Act, the management \ncorporation can make a by-law conferring on subsidi ary proprietor(s) the exclusive \nuse and enjoyment or special privileges in respect of the whole or any part of the \ncommon property) \n71. In the later part of 2007, the condominium mana ger after having informed Yap that \nhis applications in connection with the VS and ACC were not approved because of  \nconstraints of the Act  informed him that the MCST had allowed him to comm ence \nhis A&A works including relocation of the VS and in stallation of the ACC. \n72. A&A works including relocation of the VS were t hen carried out by Yap\u2019s \ncontractors and completed before 15 th  March 2008. The works were carried out \nopenly and not in a furtive or surreptitious manner . \n73. There were 5 VS originally.  3 of the VS termin ated at Yap's 26 th  level roof terrace \nand a 4 th  VS terminated on the 27 th  level roof top.  Yap relocated these four VS \nand added a new exhaust pipe and collected all 5 pi pes neatly together next to the \nexisting 5 th  VS on the 27 th  level roof top beside the lift motor room wall.  T he scope \nof works is clearly illustrated in the drawings at YSL4 pages 23 to 25 stamped by a \nProfessional Engineer (BP4, BP22, BP31, BP41, and B P46). The relocation of the \nVS was considered by the PUB as \u201cminor work\u201d that d id not require submission of \nplans or notice of work to them (Page 22 of YSL4) A s regards the coring through \nthe 26 th  and 27 th  floor structural concrete slabs for the 5 pipes an d the re-running \nof the pipes, the professional engineer has, in eff ect, certified that the structural \nintegrity of the building is not compromised by the  work done (Page 23 of YSL4).  STB 77 & 95 of 2012 \u2013 Yong An Park     Page 11 of 18 \n THE LIGHTNING PROTECTION SYSTEM (LPS): \n74. Every block has a LPS and its purpose is to pro tect the building. The LPS at Blk \n327 was installed before the Code of Practice for L ightning Protection \n(CP33:1996) came into force and does not comply wit h CP33:1996. It comprised \nhorizontal air terminals that ran along the parapet  of the roof terrace and the flat \nroof. \n75. Sometime in late 2007, Yap informed the condomi nium manager that he would be \ninstalling, a lightning protection device and that it would be in accordance with \nrules and regulations of the authorities. After the  condominium manager had \nverbally allowed him to proceed, Yap completed the installation before 15 th  March \n2008. \n76. Yap concealed the exposed horizontal air termin als on the parapet of the roof \nterrace and an Ionostar lightning conductor was add ed to the horizontal air \nterminal at the parapet of the flat roof to provide  a parabolic umbrella zone of \nprotection (BP23).  \n77. The design and installation was in accordance w ith CP33:1996 and installation \nwas supervised by a professional engineer licensed by the PUB (Tab 50 of AB2). \nA professional engineer has certified that the exis ting LPS has not been \ncompromised (Page 28 of YSL4) \nTHE AIR CON CONDENSER (ACC): \n78. ACCs were originally within the premises of var ious units. \n79. On 19 th  June 2007, Yap applied for approval to install his  ACC at the flat roof of his \nblock and he was informed by the MCST that installa tion at the roof constituted \nexclusive use and enjoyment of common property and the MCST could not grant \napproval without a 90% resolution passed in a gener al meeting. \n80. Without written approval from the MCST, Yap pro ceeded to relocate his ACCs and \ncompleted the installation before 15 th  March 2008. The hole where one of the \noriginal VS was located was used to run the condens ing piping to the flat roof i.e . \nthere was no alteration to the structure of the fla t roof (BP11). The ACCs whilst \npositioned above the flat roof were in fact attache d to the wall of the motor room \n(BP14, BP16, BP31, BP44 and BP46)  \nTHE APPLICATIONS AND THE SUBMISSIONS:  \n81. In STB 77 of 2012, Yap has made an application for the following orders:  \nTo order the Respondent (MCST) to accept the rights  of, and/or grant consent to \nthe Applicant\u2019s following alterations and additions  made to the rooftop and/or the \ncommon properties of the building:- \n(a) Relocation of the ventilation stacks approved b y the PUB; \n(b) Addition of lightning protection systems to the  existing lightning protection \nsystem; and \n(c) Installation of air condition condensers  STB 77 & 95 of 2012 \u2013 Yong An Park     Page 12 of 18 \n 82. The Board is not aware and it was not shown tha t there is any provision, including \nS 101(1) of the Act that provides for the Board to make an order for the \nmanagement corporation or anyone to accept the righ ts of another. \n83. Whilst S 111 of the Act provides for the Board to make orders for management \ncorporations to consent to proposals by subsidiary proprietors to effect alterations \nto common property or authorise under S 37(4) impro vements in or upon a lot \nwhich affects the appearance of the building, it ap peared from Yap\u2019s written \nsubmissions that he had abandoned his application f or an order for the Board to \norder the MCST to grant consent as it was his submi ssion that no approval was \nrequired for the alterations made by him and if app roval was required verbal \napproval had been given. \n84. There was also no reference for an order from t he Board for the MCST to grant \nconsent in the Opening Statement (Page 11 of YSL1).  Here Yap said that he \nwanted the Board to determine whether the following said A&A carried ou t by me \nto the roof terrace are legal or illegal and if the  Honourable Board found them to be \nillegal to further determine whether the MCST ought  to be granted an order to \ncompel me to reinstate/remove the same.  \n85. We considered the submissions of Yap that no ap provals were required for the \nalterations made and if approvals were required, ve rbal approval had been given.  \n86. In addition to the submissions that approvals w ere not required and if required had \nbeen verbally given, Yap submitted that he had been  discriminated by the MCST; \nand that MCST had committed dishonest/ fraudulent a cts.  \n87. We did not find that there was any evidence to support these submissions. Yap in \nhis Opening Statement and submissions also referred  to works carried out by \nother owners and other applications made by him. Th e Board is of the view that \nthese are not relevant and will not in this grounds  of decision deal with them. \nTHE VENTILATION STACKS (VS): \n88. It was submitted that the VS is not common prop erty. Yap after referring to the \ndefinition of \u201ccommon property\u201d pointed out that th e VS were located within the \nservice duct and the service duct terminated at the  25 th  floor and thereafter was \nwholly within Yap\u2019s unit and because it was wholly within his lot it could not be \ncommon property as it was not within one of the two  limbs of common property viz \n\u201cnot comprised in any lot \u201d. As such he did not require any approval from the  MCST \nafter approval had been given by the PUB. \n89. S 29(1)(b)(iii) of the Act provides that it \u2026  shall be the duty of a management \ncorporation\u2026to properly maintain and keep in a good  state and serviceable \nrepair\u2026any fixture or fitting (including any pipe p ole wire, cable or duct) which is \ncomprised within a lot and which is intended to be used for the servicing or \nenjoyment of the common property.   \n90. The VS were fixtures/ fittings comprised within  a lot, which was intended to be \nused for the servicing or enjoyment of the common p roperty. They provided \nventilation for the sanitary system for all the uni ts in the building. They were STB 77 & 95 of 2012 \u2013 Yong An Park     Page 13 of 18 \n fixtures/fittings that the management corporation h ad a duty to maintain and keep \nin a state of good and serviceable repair.  \n91. We did not agree with the submission that becau se the VS were not common \nproperty, approval was not required before an alter ation was made to it. The VS \nwas not the property of Yap and did not belong to h im. Whilst Yap and other \nsubsidiary proprietors have rights to effect improv ements on their lots (S 37(3), \nthey do not and cannot have any right to alter fixt ures and fittings which the Act \nrequires the MCST to maintain and keep in a state o f good and serviceable repair. \n92. It was a further submission of Yap that no appr oval was required from the MCST \nfor the relocation of the VS because he was, for he alth reasons, allowed under By-\nlaw 5(3) of the prescribed by-laws in The Building Maintenance (Strata \nManagement) Regulations 2005 to do the relocation. Whilst the Board did not find \nthat there was any evidence that the VS was in any way a health hazard, the \nBoard was of the view that it was indeed for health  reasons that Yap had sought \napproval for the relocation. It was however the fin ding of the Board that By-law \n5(3) did not permit the relocation of the VS.  \n93. By-law 5(1) and 5(3) provides as follows:  \n\u201c (1) A subsidiary proprietor or an occupier shall not mark paint drive nails or \nscrews or the like into or otherwise damage or defa ce, any structure that forms \npart of the common property except with the prior w ritten approval of the \nmanagement corporation \n(3) This by-law shall not prevent a subsidiary propriet or or an occupier or a \nperson authorised by such subsidiary proprietor fro m installing  \u2013 (a) any locking or \nother safety device for protection of the subsidiar y proprietor or occupier\u2019s lot \nagainst intruders or to improve safety within the l ot; ((b) any screen or other device \nto prevent entry of animals or insects on the lot; (c) any structure or device to \nprevent harm to children; or (d) any device used to  affix decorative items to the \ninternal surfaces of walls in the subsidiary propri etor\u2019s or occupier\u2019s lot\u201d  \n94. The relocation of the VS, in this case by diver ting a fixture/ fitting belonging to the \nMCST, was not an installation of a safety device or a structure or device to \nprevent harm to children. \n95. With regard to the submission that verbal appro val had been given, it is our finding \nthat Steve Teo had verbally informed Yap that he co uld proceed. As to whether it \nwas in order for Yap to proceed on the basis of the  verbal approval, we are of the \nview that it was not in order for him to have done so and agree with the \nsubmissions of the MCST at paragraphs 7 to 18 of MC 4.  \n96. By virtue of SS 67(1) and (3) of the Act, the p owers and duties of a managing \nagent are governed by an instrument in writing and/ or an ordinary resolution. The \nMCST in this case had not granted the approval soug ht by Yap. Even if Steve Teo \nhad the approval of the MCST to inform Yap that he could proceed, the approval \nwould have, by virtue of S 67(2) of the Act, been i nvalid. \n \n STB 77 & 95 of 2012 \u2013 Yong An Park  Page 14 of 18 THE LIGHTNING PROTECTION SYSTEM (LPS): \n97. As noted earlier, no written application was submitted in connection with the\nalteration made. Verbal approval from Steve Teo was not approved by the MCST.\n98. It was the submission of Yap that he was by virtue of By-law 5(3) of the prescribed\nby-laws permitted to do what he did.\n99. As in the case of the VS, whilst there was no evidence that what was in place\nbefore the alterations was in any way a health hazard, the Board was satisfied that\nit was for the purpose of  improving safety that led to the alterations. The\nsubmission of the MCST (relying on the case of Management Corporation Strata\nPlan No 2570 v Ng Khai Chuan 2006 SGDC 176) was that the safety features and\ndevices which are allowed to be installed are those which can be easily attached\nwithin the strata lot or with minimal encroachment onto the common property  and it\nwas submitted that what was done by Yap exceeded that contemplated under the\nsafety exception.\n100. Subsidiary proprietors are not prohibited from and can install safety devices to\nimprove safety within their lots. In this case, safety would be enhanced by the\nalterations made by Yap. The Board had viewed the alterations done to the LPS\nand it is not our finding that what was done exceeded that contemplated by the\nsafety exception.\n101. The Board is of the view that the alterations in connection with the LPS were not\nout of order.\nTHE AIR CON CONDENSER (ACC): \n102. It was Yap\u2019s submission that the flat roof was not accessible to others; not capable \nof being used or enjoyed by others; there was no serviceable installation on it that \nrequired the MCST to access for maintenance and repair. As such the flat roof was \nnot common property and it was in order for him to relocate his ACC on the flat \nroof.\n103. From the plans submitted and our inspection of the premises, the flat roof over \nYap\u2019s unit was not (unlike the flat roof over his neighbour at unit #XXX) specifically \nbuilt as a roof for his unit. There were two flat roofs in the block - one was over unit \n#XXX and the other was over unit #XXX and unit #XXX.\n104. It is not correct that the flat roof over Yap\u2019s unit is not accessible to anyone and \ncould only be accessed via Yap\u2019s premises. It could be accessed from the flat roof \nover unit #XXX (In BP17 and BP22, it can be seen that there is a fence between \nthe flat roof over Yap\u2019s and his neighbour\u2019s unit and it would not be difficult to \ncross from one side to the other).\n105. Even if it was the case that that it could not be accessed except via Yap\u2019s \npremises (as in the case of the flat roof over unit #XXX), it was submitted by the \nMCST that exclusive access as contended by Yap is not contemplated in the \ndefinition of \u201ccommon property\u201d.\n106. Under S 29(1) (d) of the Act, the MCST must, when directed by a special \nresolution, install and provide additional facilities or make improvements toSTB 77 & 95 of 2012 \u2013 Yong An Park  Page 15 of 18 common  property  for the benefit  of subsidiary  proprietors.  It is not beyond \ncontemplation that the MCST would be required to install satellite dishes and other \ncommunication devices on the flat roofs over Yap\u2019s premises or over unit #XXX.  \nAnd when this comes about, Yap (and the owner of unit #XXX) would by virtue of S \n31 of the Act be required to allow access to the flat roof through his penthouse \nwhen work, necessary under S 29(1)(d), has to be carried out. \n107. Yap\u2019s submission that such devices could be installed on the angled roof rather\nthan on the flat roof would not detract from the fact that they could be installed on\nthe flat roof. Technical and other requirements could well determine that they\nshould be installed on the flat roof rather than on the angled roof.\n108. It is not inconceivable that had Yap not installed the Ionostar lightning conductor to\nthe LPS, a special resolution could well have been passed for the MCST to install\nIonostar lightning conductor to the LPS of all the buildings in the estate and Yap\nwould have had to allow access via his premises for this to be done.\n109. The flat roof was not comprised in any lot and because it could be used for\ninstallations of, inter alia communication devices, it was capable of being used or\nenjoyed by occupiers of two or more lots.\n110. The Board was of the view that the flat roof above Yap\u2019s unit was common\nproperty.\n111. In the case of Mark Wheeler v The Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No\n751 and Anor [2003] SGSTB 5, the Board after referring to, inter alia Alex Ilkin in\nStrata Title Management and the Law where the author cited the installation of air\nconditioners in a wall as an example of having exclusive use of common property,\ndecided that the installation of an awning to common property which could only be\nused by the owner of the lot amounted to exclusive use of common property.\n112. In relocating his ACC to the flat roof (as noted earlier the ACCs were in fact affixed\nto the wall of the motor room and there can be no question that this was common\nproperty), there was exclusive use and enjoyment of common property.\nREINSTATEMENT OF VS AND REMOVAL OF ACC:  \n113. In view of our findings, we considered whether orders should be made against Yap\nrequiring him to (i) reinstate at his own costs the ventilation stacks which currently\nterminate at the rooftop of Block 327 to their original condition; and (ii) remove at\nhis own costs, the unauthorized air conditioning condenser units located at the\nrooftop of Block 327and reinstates the rooftop to its original condition.\n114. The Board could not but note that it was more than four years after the works had\nbeen completed and after Yap had filed his application in STB 77 of 2012 that the\nMCST filed the application in STB 95 of 2012.\n115. It was the submission of the MCST that the orders could be made under SS\n101(1) and 117(2) of the Act. The cases of Management Corporation Strata Title\nPlan 1395 v Chong Keng Ban (alias Johnson Chong and Anor [2003] SGSTB 6\nand Chong Keng Ban (alias Johnson Chong) and Anor v Management Corporation\nStrata Title Plan 1395 [2004] 3 SLR(R) 138 were cited in support of theSTB 77 & 95 of 2012 \u2013 Yong An Park     Page 16 of 18 \n submission. There was no submission from Yap that t he Board did not have the \npowers to make the orders. \n116. SS 101(1) and 117(2) provide as follows:  \n101\u2014 (1)  Subject to subsections (4), (6) and (7), a Board may, pursuant to an \n application by a management corporation or subsidi ary management corporation, \n a subsidiary proprietor, mortgagee in possession, lessee or occupier of a lot in a \n subdivided building, make an order for the settlem ent of a dispute, or the \n rectification of a complaint, with respect to \u2014 \n (a) any defect in a lot, a subdivided building or its common property or \n  limited common property; \n (b) the liability of a subsidiary proprietor to be ar the costs of or any  \n  part thereof for any work carried out by a manage ment corporation \n  or subsidiary management corporation, as the case  may be, in the \n  exercise of its powers or performance of its duti es or functions  \n  conferred or imposed by this Act or the by-laws r elating to the  \n  subdivided building or limited common property, a s the case may \n  be; or \n (c)  the exercise or performance of, or the failur e to exercise or  \n  perform, a power, duty or function conferred or i mposed by this Act \n  or the by-laws relating to the subdivided buildin g or limited  \n  common property, as the case may be . \n117\u2014 (2)  Without prejudice to subsection (1), a Bo ard may order \u2014 \n (a) a management corporation or its council; \n(b) a subsidiary management corporation or its exec utive committee; \n(c) a managing agent; or \n(d) a subsidiary proprietor or other person having an estate or interest \n in  a lot or an occupier of a lot, \nto do or refrain from doing a specified act with re spect to a subdivided \n building or the common property or limited common property, as the \n case may be  \nIt is to be noted that the provisions do not mandat e that a Board must make the \norders specified and that a Board has the discretio n whether or not to make the \norders sought. \n117. The Board was satisfied that we had the powers  to make the orders sought by the \nMCST and was conscious of the fact that it was the duty of the management \ncorporation to act in the common interests of all s ubsidiary proprietors. Subsidiary \nproprietors cannot be allowed to ignore the authori ty of the management \ncorporation and when this happens and is not challe nged; its authority will be \nadversely affected and undermined.  \n118. In deciding whether the orders should be made,  we considered the decision of the \nHigh Court in Management Corporation Strata Title P lan 1378 v Chen Ee Yueh \nRachel [1993] 3 SLR(R)630 (the Chen case). STB 77 & 95 of 2012 \u2013 Yong An Park     Page 17 of 18 \n 119. Although the Chen case was a decision under S 41(14) of the Land Titles (Strata) \nAct (Cap 158, 1988 Rev Ed) - now S 32(10) of the Ac t - which entitled \nmanagement corporations and subsidiary proprietors to apply to the court:  \n(a)  for an order to enforce the performance or to restrain the breach of any by-\n  law; or \n(b)  to recover damages for any loss or injury to perso n or property arising out \n  of the breach of any by-law  \n we were of the view that the decision is applicabl e in our case. \n120. In the Chen case the management corporation ha d applied for a mandatory \ninjunction against a subsidiary proprietor to remov e windows and louvres \nenclosing the front balcony of the unit and to rest ore the external wall of the \nbuilding to its original state and condition. The s ubsidiary proprietor had made \nalterations without first obtaining approval that w as required under a by-law. The \naim and object of the by-law was to maintain the ex ternal appearance of the \nbuilding and the alterations had affected the overa ll appearance of the building.   \n121. Chao J, as he then was, after reviewing and co nsidering various precedents in \nconnection with how the equitable jurisdiction of t he court should be exercised with \nregard to the granting of a mandatory injunction no ted that it will not be issued \nunless very serious damage will ensue from the with holding of the injunction. Inter \nalia Chao J referred to the case of Proprietors \u2013St rata Plan No 464 v Oborn (1975) \n2 CCH Strata Title Law and Practice 50 where the ju dge, Holland J said:  \n The general principle to be extracted from these c ases is that a court will grant a \n mandatory injunction to redress a breach of a nega tive covenant, the breach of \n which is already accomplished unless: \n(a) The plaintiff\u2019s own conduct would make it unjus t to do so; \n(b) The breach is trivial or has caused no damage or no  appreciable damage to \nthe plaintiff and a mandatory injunction would impo se substantial hardship on \nthe defendant with no counterbalancing benefit to t he plaintiff  \n122. The orders sought by the management corporatio n were not granted after Chao J \nfound that uniformity sought could not be obtained in that case by granting the \ninjunction because there were other units that had similar addition/alteration that \ncould not be removed; there was no evidence that th e subsidiary proprietor had \nknowingly refused to obtain approval before proceed ing with alterations/additions; \nand in the circumstances of the case, to order the removal of the sliding windows \nwould cause hardship without any real corresponding  benefit to the management \ncorporation. \n123. In the case at hand, the Board after noting:  \ni) that the PUB no longer allows VS to be terminate d in the private roof area that \n is designed for use by the occupants;  \nii)  the events that took place when Yap had first sought the consent of the MCST \n to relocate the VS and the ACC and the relocation of the VS and ACC (inter \n alia we were of the view that Yap\u2019s application ha d not been dealt with \n in a timely manner and a robust internal process b e put in place whereby the \n managing agent is apprised of the scope of what he  might or might not say or STB 77 & 95 of 2012 \u2013 Yong An Park  Page 18 of 18 represent to unit owners \u2013 in AB1, it was noted that on more than one \noccasion, the MCST had no record of the condominium manager conveying \nan approval/ disapproval to Yap, in connection with an application. Yap had \nalso not commenced with the relocations until after oral approval had been \ngiven by the condominium manager);  \niii) the manner in which the relocation was done (inter alia we noted that the\nrelocation works were carried out openly and carried on till completion without\nany indication from the MCST that works were not in order. The\nrelocated VS and the newly added exhaust pipe were collected neatly together\nalongside where the existing 5th VS was; there are good health reasons for\nrelocating the 3 VS located at the 26th storey roof terrace even if the law does\nnot mandate it; and did not prevent or obstruct the use of the motor room or\nexpansive flat roof);\niv) the relocations had not in any way adversely affected the building and the\nfa\u00e7ade of the building (inter alia it was noted that the ACC were neatly placed\nagainst the motor room wall 27 storeys above the ground and do not have any\npractical adverse impact on the view or appearance of the external fa\u00e7ade of\nthe building); and\nv) the fact that relocation would result in time and monetary expenses on the part\nof Yap without any real corresponding benefit to the management corporation;\nwas of the view that the orders sought should be not be made against Yap. \n128. Accordingly it is ordered:\ni) The applications in STB 77 of 2012 are dismissed.\nii) No order is made on the applications in STB 95 of 2012.\niii) No order is made as to costs\nDated this 7th day of October 2013 \n \nMR REMEDIOS F.G \nDeputy President \nPROF TEO KEANG SOOD \nMember \nMR CHUA KOON HOE \nMember  "

The A pplicants are subsidiary proprietors in the development known as \nSymphony Heights at 33 Hume Avenue S598734 and the R espondent s are  \nthe management corporation. The Applicants have applied for the following \norders:   \n \n1. An order that the Respondent provides all information and documents \nrelating to the EOGM that took place on 12 Jan 2013. Such information \nto include                  \n                                          \na. all proxy forms submitted for the EOGM    \n \nb. attendance record s for the EOGM indicating which attendees are in \nperson and which are by proxy; and                                                                                                                                     \n \nc. records and evidence o f the vote count for the resolution passed at \nthe EOGM with the numerical count of the number of votes for and \nagainst the resolution.  \n \n2. An order that the resolution removing the Applicant from the position of \nSecretary of the Council of the Respondent whic h was passed at the \nEOGM be declared null and void and/or alternatively that the said \nresolution be invalidated.  \n \n3. That the Council members of the Respondents be personally ordered \nto bear all the costs of this Application . \n \nThe orders were sought under SS 113, 103 and 104 of the Building \nMaintenance and Strata Management Act 2004 (the Act) . \n  \nBackground  \n \n2. Before the 12/01/13 the Applicant, Teo Guat Kim Colleen (Teo) was a \ncouncil member and secretary in the management corporation. It will be \nsufficient to state that she did not have a good relationship with some of the \nother council members and the managing agents of the estate. Be fore the \nEOGM on the 12/01/13 she, together with other subsidiary proprietors had \nrequisitioned for the convening of an EOGM to inter alia remove the \nmanaging agents. The council did not convene the meeting that had been 3 \n requisitioned for. There are provis ions in the Act that allowed for Teo and/or \nany of the subsidiary proprietors who had requisitioned for the meeting to \nproceed to convene a meeting. This was not done.  \n \n3. At the EOGM on the 12/01/13 there was only one motion on the agenda viz \nto consider and  resolve by way of an ordinary resolution that the secretary \nof the 12th management council ( i.e. Teo) be removed by Management \nCorporation Strata Title Plan 2318 . \n \n4. Voting was by poll and subsidiary proprietors with 332 share values \n(67.48%) voted in favour of the motion and subsidiary proprietors with 160 \nshare values (32.52%) voted against.  \n \nThe Applicants\u2019 case  \n \n5. Following the EOGM Teo submitted a written request to check the proxy for \nthe 12th January 2013 and inspect the attendance and the total nu mbers of \nthe quorum for the meeting with the end result of the total numbers of the \nvote for the agenda for the EOGM . \n \n6. Her requests were not acceded to. The refusal according to Wee Keng \nJong  (Wee) , council member and treasurer of the management corporation \nwas due to Teo having \u201c\u2026demonstrated propensity to confront and \nintimidate those who stood in her way or challenged her\u2026\u201d  Wee also \ninformed that solicitors for the management corporation had adv ised that \nwhat had been requested should not be released \u201c\u2026 on the basis of \namongst other things, that these documents had been the subject of legal \nadvice to the MCST\u2026the subject of Legal Professional Privilege or Legal \nadvice Privilege. We were also advis ed that there exists substantial risks \nthat (Teo) would confront and intimidate those SPs who had given proxies \nagainst her interests. We were also advised that the MCST bears the duty \nto ensure that the identities of those SPs are protected given (Teo\u2019s) \npropensity to cause problems\u2026  4 \n  \n7. With regard to nullif ication of the resolution, it was the  Applicants \u2019 case that \nthe notice in connection with the EOGM on 12/01/13 was insufficient i .e. did \nnot comply with paragraph 1 of the First Schedule of the Act.  Teo i n her \nAEIC said that she  received the notice on the 03/01/13 and the date stamp \non the envelope showed that it was posted on the 31/12/12 . \n \n8. In connection with the application for the nullification/invalidation of the \nresolution it was the Respondent s\u2019 case  that that the notices and necessary \ndocuments were served in accordance with the requirements in the First \nSchedule of the Act i .e. at least 14 days before the meeting. A Certificate of \nPosting from Singapore Post evidencing that the documents were posted  \non the 29/12/12 was exhibited.  \n \nConsiderations  \n \nThe application for information and documents  \n \n9. The Applicants have applied for orders with regard to provision of \ninformation and documents. Requests had been made for the documents \nunder S 47 of  the Act and these were not  made available. The \nRespondents in paragraph of their written submission s accept that \u201c\u2026S 47 \nof the BMSMA\u2026in the normal course of business would entitle (the \napplicants) to the documents.\u201d  \n \n10. There is no dispute that the documents  and information have not been \nmade available. It the case for Respondents that MCST does not have to \nmake them available of the ground that the information/documents are \nprotected by legal professional privilege and because Teo is seeking to \ndiscover the names and identities of the proxies in order to harass and \nintimidate them. It is not the case that the documents and information do \nnot exist and it is also not the case that the information or documents have \nsince been made available or supplied.  5 \n  \n11. Genera l meetings of management corporations must be conducted in \naccordance with the First Schedule of the Act. Paragraph 7 of the First \nSchedule requires that secretary of the management corporation must be \nput up a list of names of the persons who are entitled  to vote  on the notice \nboard on the notice board maintained on the common property at least 48 \nhours before the general meeting . Paragraph 5 provides that votes can be \ncast by persons who are entitled to vote personally or by his duly appointed \nproxy . The provisions in connection with the instrument of proxy are set out \nin Paragraphs 17, 18, 19 and 20 i .e. it must be in writing ; under the hand of \nthe person appointing the proxy or his attorney duly authorised in writing ; If \nit is a company appointing , it must be either under seal or  under  the han d \nof an officer or its attorney duly authorized.  Where it is intended to  afford  \nsubsidiary proprietors an opportunity of voting for or against a resolution \nthe format of the proxy form must  set this out. The ins trument appointing a \nproxy must be deposited at the registered address of the management \ncorporation or such other place as is specified in the notice convening the \nmeeting not less than 48 hours before the time for the holding of the \nmeeting. In default t he instrument of proxy shall not be treated as valid. A \nproxy need not be a subsidiary proprietor;  is entitled  to cast a vote on \nbehalf of him self if he entitled to vote at the same time whe n he casting a \nvote as a proxy. O ne person can be a proxy for more  than one i .e. several \nsubsidiary proprietors may decide to appoint the same person as their \nproxy and this person may vote separately as a proxy in each case. A \nproxy cannot exercise a vote in relation to a matter if the person who \nappointed the proxy is exercising personally a power to vote on the matter. \nVotes given in accordance with the terms of the proxy instrument will be \nvalid so long as there is no information (in writing) of revocation or other \ndefect receiv ed by the management corporation  before the meeting.  \n \n12. It is clear from the provisions that any subsidiary proprietor who is \ndissatisfied with the results of a vote count where there were votes cast by 6 \n one or more proxies will have a right to inspect the instruments appointing \nthe proxy.  \n \n13. It can be noted that the minutes of the meeting had recorded all the \nattendees at the meeting \u2013 Subsidiary Proprietors as per Attendance List.  \nThe attendance list was however no t attached to the mi nutes.  \n \n14. As noted above it was  not the Respondents\u2019 case th at the Applicants are \nnot, under S 47 of the Act, entitled to the documents and information \nrequested. It was  their case that the Applicants are not entitled to the \ndocuments and information because they are protected by legal \nprofessio nal privilege and be cause Teo was  seeking to discover the names \nand identities of the proxies in order to harass and intimidate them . \n \n15. It is the law that documents and information co vered by legal advice \nprivilege  need not be supplied under S 47 of the Act and this is not \ndisputed or in any way challenged by the Applicants. It is their case that the \ninformation and documents requested for are not covered by the privilege.  \n \n16. Legal advice privilege at common law is a substantive legal right that may \nbe claimed and is available ev en when there are no judicial or quasi -judicial \nproceedings pending or contemplated. In the case of Balabel v Air India \n[1988] 1 Ch 317 which was cited with approval by the Court of Appeal in \nSkandinavviska Enskilda AB (Publ), Singapore Branch v As ia Pacif ic \nBreweries (Singapore ) Pte Ltd [2007] SGCA 9 Parker LJ said \u201c\u2026the \npurpose and scope of the privilege is to enable legal advice to be sought \nand given in confidence. In my judgement therefore the test is whether the \ncommunication or other document was mad e confidentially for the purpose \nof legal advice\u2026.\u201d  \n \n17. It was the submission of the Respondents that the information and \ndocuments sought were privileged because advice was sought by the \ncouncil in connection with the removal of Teo from the council and what 7 \n could be done with regard to remarks made that we re considered to be \ndefamatory.  It appears that advice was given to the effect that Teo could be \nremoved via votes during an EOGM and voting could be via proxies. \nAdvice on use of proxies was sought and given because there was concern \nthat Teo would confront and harass those who wanted to remove her.  \n \n18. Accordingly the council had  sought advice and advice was given in \nconnection with the provisions in the Act that enabled the removal of a \ncouncil member.  \n \n19. The Board is  of the view that the fact  that advice was  sought and given in \nconnection with the provisions in the Act that enabled the removal of a \ncouncil member did not and cannot clothe privilege on the proxy forms \nsubmitted at the  EOGM; the attendance records for the EOGM ; and the \nrecords and evidence of t he vote count . The proxy forms submitted at the \nEOGM; the attendance records; the records and evidence of the vote count \nwere not communications and/or documents that passed between the \nRespondents and their lawyers when advice was being sought and given . \nThe documents were also not \u201cmade confidentially for the purpose of legal \nadvice\u201d and therefore did not qualify for legal advice privilege under the test \napproved by the Court of Appeal in Skandinavviska Enskida AB (Publ), \nSingapore Branch v Asia Pacific  Breweries (Singapore) Pte Ltd [2007] \nSGCA 9.   \n \n20. The Board is also of the view that there is no merit in the submission that it \nwas in order for the Respondents not to disclose the \ninformation/documents  to Teo on the ground  that Teo would use the \ninformation/document to harass and intim idate those who voted for her \nremoval . It appeared to be the submission of the Respondents that there \nwas a duty on the part of a management corporation to protect subsidiary \nproprietors from harassment and i ntimidation in connection with voting at \ngeneral meetings. There was first of all no evidence that Teo would use the \ninformation/documents to harass and intimidate subsidiary proprietors who 8 \n had voted for her removal and there is no provision in the Act th at provides \nthat a management corporation has a duty or responsibility to protect \nvoters in a meeting from harassment and intimidation.                                        \n                                              \nThe application for nullification / invalidation of the resolution  \n \n21. Under S 103 of the Act the Board can invalidate any resolution where the \nBoard considers that the provisions of the Act have not been complied with.  \n \n22. Under S 104 the Board can order that a particular resolution be treated as  \na nullity  where the Board is satisfied that it would not have been \npassed\u2026but for the fact that the applicant \u2026was improperly denied a vote \non the motion for the resolution; or was not given due notice of the item of \nbusiness pursuant to which the resolut ion was passed.  \n \n23. Everyone who has an interest in a meeting and wants to attend should \nreceive sufficient notice of the date time and place. In Paragraph 1(1) of the \nFirst Schedule of the Act it is provided that at least  14 days\u2019 notice be \ngiven. The notice s in this case were posted on the 29/12/12. Including the \nday of the meeting , there were exactly 14 days between the posting of the \nnotices and th e meeting. Whilst Paragraph 1(1 ) First Schedule of the Act \ndoes not require that there should be 14 clear days (the number of days \nintervening between the day on which the notice is given and the day of the \nmeeting) it provides that at least  14 days\u2019 notice be given. Section 2(5) of \nthe Interpretation Act provides that, unless the contrary is proved, service \nof a document by post shall be deemed to have been effected at the time at \nwhich the letter (containing the document) would be delivered in the \nordinary course of post. The notices in this case were posted on 29/12/12, \na Saturday, and would have been be del ivered two days later at the earliest \nsince Sunday is not a working day. Even if the notices were delivered on \nthe day they were posted, there were only 13 days between the posting of \nthe notices and the meeting.  Paragraph 1(1) of the First Schedule of the  \nAct is substantially the same as Paragraph 1(1) of the Third Schedule of 9 \n the Land Titles (Strata) Act Cap 158 which was in force before the passing \nof the Act. This was referred to in  Isetan (S) Ltd v Wisma Development Pte \nLtd & Anor  [1992] 1 SLR (R) 845.  In that case Chao Hick T in (J) as he then \nwas, said:  \n \nParagraph  1 of the Third Schedule to the Act provides that \"notice of a \ngeneral meeting of a management corporation shall be served on each \nsubsidiary proprietors ... at least  14 days before the meeting\". This means \nthat there must be 14 clear days between the issue of the notice and the \nday of the meeting  \n \nThe Board therefore cannot find that notice in accordance with the First \nSchedule of the Act had been given.  \n \n24. S 103 of the Act provides for applications to invalidate a resolution \nmade/passed or election held at a meeting of the Management Corporation \ndue to noncompliance of the provisions of the Act. An order to invalidate \nmust be made  when failure to comply had prejudici ally affected another \nand compliance would have resulted in a failure to pass the resolution or \naffect the election.  If failure to comply had not prejudicially affected anyone \nor compliance would not have resulted in failure to pass the resolution the \nBoard can refuse  to invalidate even if there was failure to comply.  \n \n25. It was submitted that the Applicants had been prejudiced in that if proper \nnotice had been given they would have had more time to obtain support to \ndefeat the motion. There was no evidence that more supporters could have \nbeen gathered if the meeting was he ld after 14 or more clear days had \nbeen given. There was no evidence (including any evidence to the effect \nthat one or more who wanted to attend did not attend because of the \nshortage of notice) that the failure to comply had prejudicially  affected \nanyone including the A pplicants or that compliance would have resulted in \na rejection of the motion to remove Teo .  \n 10 \n 26. The Board is satisfied that the resolution passed at the EOGM on the \n12/01/13 should not be be declared null and void and/or alternatively that \nthe said resolution be invalidated . \n \n27. There were no submissions from the Applicants as to how and why an \norder  \n \nThat the Council members of the Respondents be personally ordered to \nbear all the costs of this Application   \n \ncan be and should be made. Whilst the  management c orporation was a \nparty and the R espondent s in this application t he council members  were \nnot and there is no basis for any order to be made against any of them.  \n \n28. In view of all of the above it is ordered:  \n \n(a) That the Respondent s provide  the Applicants with all information and \ndocuments relating to the EOGM that took place on 12 Jan 2013. \nSuch information to include                  \n                                         \n(i) all proxy forms submitted for the EOGM;  \n \n(ii) attendance record s for the  EOGM indicating which attendees \nare in person and which are by proxy; and  \n \n(iii) records and evidence of the vote count for the resolution passed \nat the EOGM with the numerical count of the number of votes for \nand against the resolution.  \n \n(b) The application for  an order that the resolution removing the \nApplicant , Teo , from the position of Secretary of the Council of the \nRespondent which was passed at the EOGM be declared null and 11 \n void and/or alternatively that the said resolution be invalidated is \ndismissed.  \n \n(c) There  will be no order as to costs.  \n \nDated this 3rd day of September 2013  \n \n \n \n_______________________________  \nMR FRANCIS GEORGE REMEDIOS  \nDeputy President  \n \n \n_______________________________  \nMR RICHARD TAN MING KIRK  \nMember  \n \n \n_______________________________  \nMR LIM GNEE KIANG  \nMember  \n \n \n \n "

Applicant(s) \nAnd \nCheow Sao Fai/ See Lay Yong \n \u2026 Respondent(s) \nCoram:   Seng Kwang Boon (Deputy President) \n Lee Coo (Member) \n Winston Hauw (Member) \nGROUNDS OF DECISION \nThis is an application by Megatek Enterprises (S) Pte Ltd (the \u201cApplicant\u201d), the owner of unit #XXX \nof Shun Li Industrial Park against Cheow Sao Fai/ See Lay Yong (the \u201cRespondent\u201d), the owners of \nunit #XXX  of Shun Li Industrial Park, under section 101 of the Building Maintenance and Strata \nManagement Act, for orders that (i) the Respondents install insulation in their unit of #XXX so as to \nprevent condensation on the soffit of the Applicant\u2019s unit; and (ii) the Respondents to make good the \ndamages caused as a consequence of the condensation. \nTHE APPLICANT\u2019S VERSION: \n2. Applicant\u2019s 1st witness Tham Yew Chum (\u201cAW1\u201d), a director of the Applicant, testified. AW1\ntestified that in year 2007, they discovered that the soffit of their unit was stained and water was\ndripping from three to four isolated areas. They also discovered that the soffit was cold and suspected\nthat the water droplets were due to condensation as the Respondents had cold rooms on their premises.\nThe Applicant approached the Respondents and the Management Council (\u201cMCST\u201d) for a discussion\nbut was not successful in resolving the matter.\n3. In year 2009, the Applicant repainted the soffit. Condensation, dark stains and mould, however,\nappeared again thereafter. AW1 mentioned that now there are six areas affected by the alleged\ncondensation.STB 92 of 2012 \u2013 Shun Li Industrial Park 24. Application then engaged Robinson Jones Associates Pte Ltd, a firm of chartered building\nsurveyors, to investigate.\n5. Applicant\u2019s 2nd witness, Kenneth Hugh Jones (\u201cAW2\u201d), a chartered building surveyor from\nRobinson Jones Associates Pte Ltd, testified. AW2 inspected both the Applicant and Respondents\u2019\nunits and put up 3 reports \u2013 a main report, a supplementary report and an addendum to both the main\nand supplementary reports.\n6. AW2 mentioned that he had taken the air temperature, relative humidity and T-dew readings of\nboth the premises. AW2 noted that the Applicant\u2019s unit is adequately ventilated as it is naturally\nventilated with opened doors and windows as well as mechanically ventilated with ceiling and stand\nfans.\n7. AW2 concluded that the prolonged variation in temperature within the Respondents\u2019 unit\ncaused by mechanical cooling and the relative humidity had caused condensation to the soffit of the\nApplicant\u2019s unit resulting in the subsequent mouldings and damages. AW2 is unable to identify any\nother source(s) that could have caused the condensation.\nTHE RESPONDENTS\u2019 VERSION: \n8. Respondents\u2019 1st witness, Ziv Cheow Shi Xuan (\u201cRW1\u201d), an operations manager of the\nRespondents, testified. RW1 said that the air-conditioners in some of the rooms in the Respondents\u2019\nunit are kept running for 24 hours all the time as the rooms are used to store some of the products\nwhich required to be kept cool continuously.\n9. RW1 denied that the condensation and mouldings in the Applicant\u2019s unit were caused by the\nprolonged cooling in the Respondents\u2019 unit. The Respondents then engaged CC Building Surveyors\nPte Ltd to investigate.\n10. Respondents\u2019 2nd witness, Crispin Casimir (\u201cRW2\u201d), a chartered building surveyor from CC\nBuilding Surveyors Pte Ltd, testified. RW2 mentioned that he had conducted visual inspections to both\nthe Applicant and Respondents\u2019 units, the whole building in general  and a number of random units,\na\nnd subsequently put up a report.\n11. RW2 noted that the Applicant\u2019s unit is not well ventilated as the windows are not adequate.\nRW2 said that the temperature difference of 2\u00b0C to 3\u00b0C would not be significant but a difference of\n5\u00b0C to 6\u00b0C would be significant for condensation to take place. RW2 concluded that the problem in\nthe Applicant\u2019s unit is due to inadequate ventilation and the high relative humidity.\nTHE BOARD\u2019S FINDINGS: \n12. On the evidence adduced, the Board is of the view that there is condensation on the soffit of the\nApplicant\u2019s unit which has caused water stains marks, damages and mould growth.\n13. The Board finds the reports of AW2 helpful and comprehensive. AW2 had taken the\ntemperatures; moisture content levels of the soffit; relative humidity; T-dew points; and other data and\nconcluded that the mechanical cooling within the Respondents\u2019 unit is low enough to cause the soffit\nof the RC slabs to fall below the dew point and hence condensation. AW2 also noted that the\nventilation in the Applicant\u2019s unit is adequate and gave his reasons. AW2 could not find any other\ncause for the condensation to take place.STB 92 of 2012 \u2013 Shun Li Industrial Park 314. The Board finds the report of RW2 unhelpful. RW2 concluded that the problem in the\nApplicant\u2019s unit was due to the unit not being well ventilated. RW2 had, however, failed to either\nexplain how poor ventilation could cause the problem or provide some details as to why/ how the\nApplicant\u2019s unit is not well ventilated. Although RW2 is of the view that the recorded temperature\ndifference between the air and soffit of the Applicant\u2019s unit is not considered significant to cause the\nproblem, RW2 had failed to provide any scientific explanation to support his view. Notwithstanding\nthis view, RW2 conceded that a small temperature difference may cause condensation if the relative\nhumidity is sufficiently high.\n15. In the circumstances, the Board accepts the reports of AW2 and finds that the condensation on\nthe soffit of the Applicant\u2019s unit is caused by the low temperature in the Respondents\u2019 unit, as a result\nof prolonged mechanical cooling.\nTHE BOARD\u2019S DECISION: \n16. The Board finds the Respondents liable and orders the following:-\na) Respondents to install proper insulation on the floor of their unit to prevent further\ncondensation on the soffit of the Applicant\u2019s unit, within one (1) month from the date of\nthis order;\nb) Respondents to clean, paint and repair the areas of the soffit in the Applicant\u2019s unit which\nare damaged by the condensation, within one (1) month from the date of this order;\nc) Respondents to pay a global sum of S$5900  (S$1250 being STB fees and S$4650 being\nApplicant\u2019s 1st surveyor\u2019s report charges ) to the Applicant, within one (1) month from\nthe date of this order.\nDated 23rd day of August 2013 \nSENG KWANG BOON \nDeputy President \nLEE COO \nMember \nWINSTON HAUW \nMember  "

Respondent(s)\nMr Tan Lian Ker\nPresident\nProf. Teo Keang Sood\nMr Tan Ee Ping\nMs Josephine Choo/Ms Emily Su\n(M/s Wong Partnership for the Applicant)\nMr Toh Kok Seng/Ms Yik Shu Ying\n(M/s Lee & Lee for the Respondent)\nSTB 28 OF 20I2 HIGHPOINT IGrounds of Decision \nl.The applicant is the management corporation (MC)  for the development known as \nHigh Point  (MCST Plan No. 367) located at 30 Mount Elizabeth,  Singapore 228519.  The \ndevelopment is 40 years old. The respondents are the subsidiary proprietors (SPs) of \nunit #XXX in the development.\n2.This is an application by the applicant under s 101 of the Building Maintenance and\nStrata Management Act (Cap 30C, 2008 Rev Ed) (BMSMA) that the respondents make\ngood any defects in the beams and columns in the latter's unit. Specifically, the dispute\npertains to defects in the beams above the ceiling of the master bedroom toilet and\nthat of the kitchen in the said unit.\n3.In essence, the application is concerned with the issue of whether it is the MC or the\nSPs who are responsible for the repair and proper maintenance of the beams in\nquestion.\nMain Issues \n4.A determination of this issue must necessarily involve a consideration of whether\nbeams are common property, in which case it is the statutory responsibility of the MC\nto repair and maintain them as provided in s 29(1)(a) and (b)(i) of the BMSMA. On the\nother hand, if beams are considered not to be common property, then the\nresponsibility would lie on the SPs of the unit concerned unless the defects in the\nbeams comprised in the said unit amount to structural defects in which case it is for the\nMC to rectify under s 30(5) of the BMSMA, subject to the SPs not being in breach of\ntheir duty imposed under s 63(a) of the same Act. The importance of identifying the\ncommon property of a strata scheme can be seen in MCST Plan No 958 v Tay Soo Seng\n[1992) 3 SLR(R) 818 where GP Selvam JC (as he then was) perceptively observed as\nfollows at [13):\n\"The Act thus makes a clear dichotomy between common property which is \nvested in the management corporation and private property which is vested in \nthe subsidiary proprietor of the lot.\" \n5.Thus, the responsibility of effecting the necessary repairs or maintenance will lie\non the MC or the SP depending on whether the relevant part of the building\nconcerned (i.e. beams in the case before us) is part of the common property or part of\nthe unit.\nSummary Of Applicant And Respondents' Arguments \n6.Not surprisingly, the applicant and respondents take opposing positions on this\nmatter. In summary, the applicant argues that the beams are not common property\nand that it is for the respondents to make good the defects in the beams. The\nSTB 28 OF 2012- HIGHPOINT 2 respondents contend otherwise. The respondents further argue that even if the beams \nare not common property, the defects therein, nevertheless, amount to structural \ndefects which the applicant is required to rectify unless the respondents had \ncommitted a breach of the duty imposed on them under s 63(a) of the BMSMA. \nAre Beams Common Property \n7.The first question to consider then is: are beams to be considered common property?\n8.For purposes of our present case, \"common property\" is defined ins 2 of the BMSMA\nto mean:\n\"(a) in relation to any land and building comprised ... in a strata title plan, \nsuch part of the land and building -\n(i)not comprised in any lot ... in that strata title plan; and\n(ii)used or capable of being used or enjoyed by occupiers of 2 or more lots ... ;\n9.It is clear that the requirements are conjunctive and both must be satisf ied, namely, \nto amount to common property, such part of the land and building must firstly not be \ncomprised in any lot (i.e. unit) in the strata title plan and secondly, must  be used or \ncapable of being used or enjoyed by the occupiers of 2 or more units. It may be noted \nthat s 3(1} of the Land Titles (Strata) Act (Cap 158, 2009 Rev Ed) provides for identical \nrequirements.\n10. A perusal of the relevant documents,  including a copy of the relevant strata \ntitle p lan of unit #XXX, indicate that the beams concerned are comprised in the said \nunit. This is further supported by Rule 41 of the Boundaries and Survey Maps \n(Conduct of Cad astral Surveys) Rules (Cap 25, R 5, 2007 Rev Ed) which provides \nthat, unless otherwi se stipulated on the strata certified plan, the common boundary \nof any unit with another unit or with the common property shall be the centre of the \nfloor, wall or ceiling, as the case may be. For purposes of the BMSMA, \"ceiling\" does \nnot include any false ceiling (see BMSMA, s 2(1)). As the first requirement is not \nsatisfied, it matters not that  the beams in question are used or capable of being used \nor enjoyed by occupiers of 2 or more units.\nWhether Defects Amount To Structural Defects \n11.It would appear then that the respondents have the responsibility to repair the\ndefects in the beams which are comprised in their said unit as the beams are not\ncommon property based on the discussion of the statutory provisions and case law\nabove.\n12.However, the respondents do not have such a responsibility if it can be shown that\nthe defects in the beams in their unit amount to structural defects which affect or is\nSTB 28 OF 2012- HIGHPOINT 3 likely to affect the support or shelter provided by their unit for another unit in the\nbuilding or the common property as set out in s 30(5)(a) of the BMSMA.\n13. The Board noted that the reports of both WTS Consulting Engineers (dated 10\nFebruary 2OL2) and the respondents' expert witness, Mr Song Wee Ngee (dated 7\nNovember 2012), took the position that the defects in the beams are structural in\nnature which are likely to have the effect as described in s 30(5)(a) of the BMSMA and\nwhich require immediate attention and urgent repair work to be undertaken.\n14. While the BMSMA is silent on what are structural defects, assistance may also be\ngathered from related legislation in this regard. The Building Control Act (Cap 29, 1999\nRev Ed) in s 2(1) provides that \"key structural elements\" of a building means \"the\nfoundations, columns, beams, shear cores, structural walls, struts, ground anchors and\nsuch other parts of a building which are essential for its support and overall structural\nstability.\" Defects in the \"key structural elements\" of a building would ordinarily\namount to structural defects.\n15. Further, in line with the requirement in the BMSMA that it is for the management\ncorporation to rectify structural defects in the building, the Building Control Act in s\n26(1) which pertains to inspection of buildings, provides that the owner of a subdivided\nbuilding is the management corporation having control of the building. Pursuant to s 28\nof the Building Control Act, the Commissioner of Buildings may, by notice served on the\nmanagement corporation, require the building to be inspected which duly took place in\nour present case on or about December 2010. WTS Consulting Engineers, which was\nappointed to undertake the inspection, made certain recommendations in its report.\nThe Building and Control Authority via their letter of 31 January 2011then directed the\nmanagement corporation (and not the subsidiary proprietors) to \"expeditiously\nimplement the measures as recommended in the report to prevent further\ndeterioration of the building structure\" and to \"continue to maintain your buildings in\ngood condition till the next inspection\" for the structural safety of the building. Any\nfailure to comply by the management corporation is made an offence in s 28(9) of the\nBuilding Control Act which attracts a fine or imprisonment or both.\n16. ln the result, the Board is of the view that the defects in the beams are structural\ndefects within the meaning of s 30(5)(a) of the BMSMA.\nWhether Respondents ln Breach Of Their Duty ln Section 63(a)(i) of the BMSMA\n17. lt may be noted that s 30(5)(a) of the BMSMA imposed a duty on the management\ncorporation to rectify a structural defect only if the defect is not due to any breach of\nthe duty imposed on the respondents as subsidiary proprietors by s 63(a) of the\nBMSMA. lt should be noted that only s 63(a) is referred to in s 30(5) of the BMSMA and\nno other provision. ln our case, the relevant provision is s 63(a)(i) of the BMSMA which\nprohibits a unit owner from doing onything ot pemitting onything to be done on or in\nrelation to his/her unit so that any support or shelter provided by the said unit for\nanother unit or common property is interfered with.\nI STB 28 OF 2012 _ HIGHPOTNT18. There are 2limbs to s 63(a). The L't limb pertains to \"shall not do anything\". lt is\nclear that for there to be a breach of duty under this limb, the unit owner must have\ndone a positive oct which interferes with the said support or shelter. ln the absence of\nsuch a positive act on the part of a unit owner, there is no breach of duty.\n19. The 2nd limb deals with \"shall not permit anphing to be done\". This may appear\nwide enough to cover omissions. (see also interpretation of the word \"act\" in s 2(1) of\nthe lnterpretation Act (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed)) However, given the intent in s 30(5) of the\nBMSMA for the burden of rectification costs for structural defects to be shared by all\nsubsidiary proprietors as such defects will impact the structural stability of the building\n(hence, the responsibility is on the MC), it cannot cover cases of mere omissions on the\npart of the SP concerned. The 2nd limb would certainly cover cases where a contractor\nof an SP damaged the beams in the unit in the course of work for which the SP must\nrightfully be held solely responsible to rectify the structural defects. lt surely cannot\ncover cases of, for example, latent defects arising from construction of the building\nwhich subsequently manifest themselves as structural defects in the unit concerned\nand for which the SP later became aware of. Being latent defects, the SP is in no way\nresponsible for the structural defects arising which affect the safety of the building\neven if the SP subsequently became aware of them. This is so even if only a single unit\nis affected. Thus, looking at the purpose and intent of s 30(5) of the BMSMA, the\ndefault position is that for structural defects which affect or is likely to affect the\nsupport provided by one unit for another unit in the building or the common property,\nthe burden of rectification costs is to be shared by all SPs and the MC is responsible to\nrectify them under s 30(5) of the BMSMA unless the SP concerned has permitted\nanything to be done to the beams or columns such that the support provided by the\nsaid unit is interfered with.\n20. Given the evidence in our present case, there is nothing to suggest that the\nrespondents were in breach of the duty imposed on them in s 63(a)(i) of the BMSMA.\nAs there was no breach of the duty in s 63(a)(i), the management corporation (i.e. the\napplicant) is, thus, duty bound (given the word \"shall\") to rectify the structural defects\nas provided in s 30(5Xa) of the BMSMA.\nRecourse To Sinking Fund By Management Corporation For Repairs of Structural\nDefects\n21. lt follows from the above that the applicant may have recourse to the moneys\navailable in the sinking fund to undertake repairs of the structural defects in the beams\nconcerned as it is for the purpose of carrying out its duties in this regard under the\nBMSMA. This is specifically provided for in s 38(6) of the BMSMA which reads: ,,A\nmanagement corporation shall not disburse any moneys from its sinking fund otherwise\nthan for the purpose of - ... (b) carrying out its powers, authorities, dufres or functions\nunder this Act.\" (emphasis added)\n22. ln the event that there is insufficient funds available in the sinking fund, the\nmanagement corporation may levy contributions on the subsidiary proprietors in\n5 STB 28 OF 20I2 HICHPOTNTaccordance with the BMSMA. Under s   (1) of the BMSMA, any expenditure lawfully\nincurred by a management corporation in the course of the exercise of any of its\npowers or functions or the carrying out of its duties or obligations is guaranteed by the\nsubsidiary proprietors who, for the time being and from time to time, comprise the\nmanagement corporation.\n23. As structural defects affect the safety and integrity of the entire building, it is sound\npolicy that the BMSMA sees it fit to impose the duty on the management corporation\nwhich is in a better position to coordinate and carry out the appropriate and necessary\nrepairs which will ultimately benefit all the subsidiary proprietors concerned\nnotwithstanding that there may be units which may not suffer from structural defects.\nln turn, it is only fair that as the subsidiary proprietors as a whole benefit from the\nrepairs of the structural defects, they should fund the rectification work through the\nsinking fund to which they contribute.\nGreater Alignment of BMSMA And Building Control Act\n24. To provide clearer guidance on what amounts to structural defects, it is suggested\nthat the BMSMA be amended so that there is greater clarity in this regard. For example,\nproviding a definition of \"structural defects\" in obvious situations (such as cases\ninvolving defects in beams or columns) or a reference to the definition of \"key\nstructural elements\" of a building in s 2(1) of the Building Control Act may assist in\nremoving uncertainty and would certainly be a welcome move. This would also align\nthe BMSMA more with the Building Control Act to ensure consistency in this respect.\n25. The application is hereby dismissed for the reasons above with no order as to costs\nDated this 4th day of July 2013\nMr Tan Lian Ker\nPresident\nProf. Teo Keang Sood\nMember\nMr Tan Ee Ping\nMember\n6STB 28 OF 20I2 - HIGHPOINT"

The Applicants are subsidiary proprietors of a lot (unit #XXX in Block 133) in \nNouvelle Park and the Respondents are the subsidiary proprietors of the lot directly  \nabove the Applicants\u2019 lot (unit #XXX).\n2. The Applicants sought various orders from the Board against the Respondents in \nrelation to the damage caused by water leakage from the Respondents\u2019 unit to the \nApplicants\u2019 unit. The orders sought included orders for the Respondents to rectify  \ndefects in five areas (i.e. the Respondents\u2019 common toilet, master toilet, yard toilet,  \nyard and kitchen) by, among other things, replacing their concealed water pipes and  \nwater proofing membranes. In addition, they wanted an order for all rectification to be \ndone \u201cto the Applicant\u2019s satisfaction\u201d. The Applicants also claimed the sum of $4,930.00  \nfor costs of repairs to the Applicants\u2019 damaged concrete soffit, false ceiling and cabinet \nand legal costs plus disbursements amounting to a total sum of $40,300.00.\n3. The Respondents opposed the Applicants\u2019 application on the basis that it was \nfrivolous and there was no basis for the Board to grant the orders sought. The reason, \nthey argued, was that they had taken the necessary actions to rectify all the known and  \ndetected seepages at every significant stage of the dispute. Among other things, they \nargued that the Applicants had unreasonably rejected their offer for a global settlement  \nand insisted on proceeding with the hearing. The Respondents also argued that there is \nno basis for the Applicants to seek an order that the Respondents pay for the costs of \ninstalling a new cabinet.\nApplicants\u2019 Case \n4. The Applicants gave evidence that, among other things, water leakage from the\nRespondents\u2019 unit had been ongoing for many years, probably since 2006. This resulted\nin damage to their lot and the formatio n of stalactites their. The Applicants\u2019 expert gave\nevidence that the leakage was due to a slow flow of water because a fast flow of water\nwould have washed the calcium deposits away. However, the water leakages were not\nnoticed earlier because the false ceiling of the Applicants initially hid them from view.\nHowever, by October 2011, the water leakages had become more extensive and\nextended to all the five areas mentioned earlier.\n5. The Applicants submitted that, while the Respondents had attempted some\nrectification works, the evidence showed that the water leakages continued because,\namong other things, the rectification works were superficial, by way of water proofing\npaint and there was a failure to repair the water pipes embedded in the walls concerned.3 6. The Applicants relied on section 101(8) of the Building Maintenance and Strata\nManagement Act (\u201cBMSMA\u201d) which provides that:\n\u201cIn any proceedings under this section with respect to any alleged defect in a lot \nor in any common property or limited common property situated immediately (whether \nwholly or partly) above another lot or any common property or limited common \nproperty, it shall be presumed, in the absence of proof to the contrary, that the defect is \nwithin that lot or common property or limited common property, as the case may be, \nabove if there is any evidence of dampness, moisture or water penetration \u2014 \n(a) on the ceiling that forms part of the interior of the lot, common property or\nlimited common property, as the case may be, immediately below; or \n(b) on any finishing material (including plaster, panel or gypsum board) attached,\nglued, laid or applied to the ceiling that forms part of the interior of the lot, common \nproperty or limited common property, as the case may be, immediately belo w.\u201d \n7. The Applicants\u2019 counsel also argued that so long as they adduced evidence of\ndampness, which they submitted they had sufficiently done, the Applicants would be\nable to rely on the presumption in section 101(8) of the BMSMA. They also submitted\nthat the Respondents had not been able to rebut the presumption.\nRespondent\u2019s Case  \n8. The Respondents argued, among other things, that:\n(a) the Applicants had no legal basis to dictate the type of rectification works required\nto fix the defect;\n(b) the Respondents had taken all actions necessary to rectify all the known defects and\ndetected seepages at every significant stage of the dispute; and\n(c)there was no basis for the Applicants to proceed with the hearing.\n9. The Respondents also submitted that because the Applicants were unreasonable\nin their demands, regardless of the outcome on liability, the Applicants ought to pay the\ncosts of the proceedings. They quantified it at $25,000.00 and all reasonable\ndisbursements.\nBoard\u2019s Decision on Liability  \n10. The Board is of the view that so long as the Applicants could prove dampness (or\nmoisture or water penetration) on their ceiling or on any finishing material attached to\nit, they would be able to rely on the presumption in section 101(8) of the BMSMA. The\nApplicants need not prove water dripping or (to use the term mentioned during the\nhearing) \u201cactive\u201d water droplets, water leaking or water seeping. Once dampness (or\nmoisture or water penetration) was proved, the onus was on the Respondents to prove\nthat there was no defect in their unit that caused the dampness, moisture or water\npenetration.4 11. On the other hand, the Board is of the view that the Applicants cannot demand\nthat the rectification be done to their satisfaction or dictate exactly how the rectification\nworks should be done so long as what the Respondents do is reasonable. As stated in\nthe document \u201cGood Industries Practices \u2013  Waterproofing for Internal Wet Areas\u201d\npublished by the Building and Construction Authority in 2003, the repairs to leakage\nthrough walls and slabs vary based on the causes determined. For the avoidance of\ndoubt, this Board agrees with the view of the Board in Re Mimosa Road (Strata Title\nPlan No. 493) [1990] SGSTB 2 that if a defect exists, abstaining from using the facility\ndoes not remedy the defect.\n12. Inclusive of the day of final oral submissions, the hearing took five days.\nAltogether ten witnesses were called and 15 affidavits filed. In addition, many\nphotographs, documents and authorities were also submitted. As the Applicants were\ncareful and meticulous, they produced a lot of documentary evidence including the\ntranscript of a conversation recorded by the First Applicant using his handphone.\n13. Suffice to say, the Board found the results of the water ponding test in the\npresence of both experts the most helpful in determining whether there were still\ndefects remaining in the Respondents\u2019 unit. During the proceedings, the Board\nsuggested that parties consider agreeing to the conduct of water ponding and water\npressure tests in the presence of both experts to ascertain if the rectification works of\nthe Respondents had fixed the defects or remaining defects and stopped the water\nseepages.\n14. While parties did not agree to the water pressure tests, they agreed to water\nponding tests over all the affected areas other than the kitchen. This was because the\nRespondents expert felt it was not possible to conduct a proper water ponding test in\nthe kitchen due to the constraints of the site. The water ponding tests were carried out\nby the Respondents\u2019 expert with the Applicants and their expert being given an\nopportunity to observe.\n15. Subsequently, the Respondents also engaged a PUB licensed plumber to carry\nout water pressure tests. However, they did this without notifying or affording the\nApplicants and their expert the opportunity to observe the tests.\n16. The outcome of the water ponding tests were briefly as follows:\n(a) Dyed water from the water ponding tests had clearly seeped through the Applicants\nfloor to the ceiling of the Respondents kitchen. The Respondents\u2019 expert view was that\nthis was due to the defective waterproofing under the floor finishes of the Respondents\u2019\nyard adjacent to the kitchen and that it was also likely that the waterproofing under the\nfloor finis hes of the Respondents\u2019 yard toilet may have also failed.5 (b) There was no water leakage in the master toilet. However, the opinion of the\nApplicants\u2019 expert was that this was due to a superficial method of repair that will only\nprovide a short-term solution.\n(c) As for the common toilet, there was disagreement between the two experts whether\nthere was any water leakage or seepage. The Applicants\u2019 expert maintained that there\nwas seepage to the common toilet ceiling of the Applicants because there were orange\nstains on the drain outlet. However, the Respondents\u2019 expert said there were no signs of\nwater seepage.\n17. While the outcome of the water ponding tests was helpful to confirm that the\nRespondents\u2019 rectification did not completely resolve all the p roblems, the Board did\nnot find the water pressure tests conducted by the Respondents\u2019 plumber on the pipes\nreliable.\n18. After considering all the evidence, the Board was satisfied that, except for the\nmaster toilet, the Respondent had not rebutted the presumption contained in section\n101(8) of the BMSMA and proven that the water seepage was not due to a defect in the\nRespondents\u2019 unit. The Board was also satisfied that the rectification works done so far\nhave not completely fixed all the defects that cause the water seepages.\n19 In addition, the Board was also satisfied that damage had been done to the \nApplicants\u2019 concrete soffit, false ceiling and cabinet. However, the sum of $4,930.00 \nclaimed for the repairs to the damaged concrete soffit, false ceiling and cabinet appears \nto be on the high side. For example, a sum of $850.00 was quoted for \u201cHaulage of \nDebris\u201d. The Board was of the view that the total sum of $3,900.00 for the repairs to the \ndamaged concrete soffit, false ceiling and cabinet would be reasonable. \n20. In the premises, the Board orders the Respondent to:\n(a) rectify the defects in their water supply pipes that cause water leakages;\n(b) reconstruct the water proofing in their common toilet, kitchen, yard and yard\ntoilet in accordance with SS CP82:1999; and\n(c)pay the Applicants the sum of $3,900.00 for repairs to the damaged concrete\nsoffit, false ceiling and cabinet,\nby 15th June 2013 at the latest. \nBoard\u2019s decision on costs  \n21. The Board was satisfied that the application was not frivolous. However, the\nBoard was of the view that the proceedings need not have been so protracted.\n22. Prior to the start of the hearing, the Board attempted to get the parties to agree\nto documents and narrow the issues in order to save time and costs but without success.6 The Board also made a number of attempts during the hearing to remind the parties \nand their witnesses to stick to the relevant issues and questions concerned.  \n23. During the final oral arguments on the last day of the hearing, the Board asked\nthe Applicants\u2019 counsel whether in view of the results of the water ponding tests they\nwere continuing to ask for every order in their application and their position was still yes.\nIt was not until counsel for the Applicants was asked again towards the end of his oral\nsubmission that the Applicants conceded that there was no need for an order to hack\nthe master toilet of the Respondents\u2019 unit.\n24. When the Respondents\u2019 counsel was similarly asked whether they were\nconceding anything as a result of the same water ponding test, they also initially said no.\nSubsequently, the Respondents\u2019 counsel conceded that their own expert had already\nnoted water seepages after the water ponding test and recommended replacing the\nwaterproofing membrane in both the Respondents\u2019  yard and yard toilet.\n25. The Board is of the view that the amount of $40,300.00 claimed by the\nApplicants for costs is not appropriate as the proceedings need not have been so\nprotracted.\n26. After considering the submissions of Applicants and the Respondents and taking\ninto account all the relevant circumstances, the Board is of the view that the\nRespondents should pay costs (inclusive of all disbursements) fixed at $20,000.00.\nDated this 15th day of May, 2013. \nMR TAN LIAN KER \nPresident \nStrata Titles Board \nMR RICHARD TAN MING KIRK \nMember \nStrata Titles Board \nMR CHAN EWE JIN \nMember  \n[2012] SGSTB  Strata Titles Board "

The Applicants are subsidiary proprietors of their respective units in Park Oasis and they \nsought various orders from the Board against the Respondent who are the management \ncorporation of Par k Oasis. The orders the Applicants sought included orders to postpone the \nAGM, withdraw the proposed amendment of the by -law regarding the parking of 3rd and \nsubsequent cars and revoke the amendment of the by -law regarding increase in management \nfund and s inking fund, pursuant to various sections of the Building Maintenance and Strata \nManagement Act (\u201cBMSMA\u201d).  \n \n2. After two rounds of mediation by the Board, the parties could not reach any settlement \nalthough a number of the issues appeared to be resolved. T he Board therefore gave directions \nfor the arbitration hearing of the dispute to be heard on 6th and 7th March 2013.  \n \n3.  On 4th February 2013, which was two days before the date for the filing and exchange of \nthe Affidavits of Evidence -in-Chief, the Appl icants\u2019 solicitors wrote a letter to the Board to \nwithdraw the application with a request that there be no order as to costs. The solicitors for the \nRespondent wrote to the Board on the same day to state they were applying for costs to be \nordered against t he Applicants.  \n \n4. As a consequence, the Board fixed a hearing for the parties to make their arguments on \ncosts on 6 March 2013.  \n \nApplicants\u2019 Arguments  \n \n5. Although the Applicants\u2019 solicitors\u2019 letter dated 4th February 2013 requested there be no \norder as to costs, the Applicants subsequently sought to claim costs against the Respondent \namounting to S$8,234.54.  \n \n6. The Applicants submitted that in the light of the events that have transpired since the \nfiling of their application, the core prayers of the App lications application had become \nacademic and as a result the Applicants saw it fit to withdraw the application altogether save \nfor the issue of costs.  \n \n7. The Applicants also argued that the Applicants have withdrawn the application not \nbecause the Board has no jurisdiction to hear the matter but because events subsequent to the \nfiling of their application have resulted in an outcome that has resolved the prayers sought for \nin favour of the Applicants.  \n \nRespondent\u2019s Arguments  \n \n8. The Respondent argued, amo ng other things, that:  \n(a) It is trite law and usual practice that a party, who having commenced an action, decides to \ndiscontinue the action, will generally be liable to pay costs to the other party to the action;  \n(b) Almost all of the orders sought by the Applic ants were not within the jurisdiction of the \nBoard and hence the application should not have been made in the first place; and   3 (c) Even if the orders sought had been within the jurisdiction of the Board (which the \nRespondent disputed), the circumstances had ch anged by the time of the first mediation, \nmaking matters academic.  \n \n9. The Respondent also submitted that the Applicants had raised various issues which \nwere not in the application and which were irrelevant.  \n \nBoard\u2019s Decision  \n \n10. The Board has the power t o order that the Applicants pay the costs up to the time of \nservice of the Applicants\u2019 written notification to withdraw the application by virtue of \nRegulation 21(3) of the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act (Strata Titles Boards) \nRegulations 2 005 (the \u201cRegulations\u201d).  \n \n11  The Board agrees with the Respondent that the usual practice is that a party, who \nhaving commenced an action, decides to discontinue the action, will generally be liable to pay \ncosts to the other party to the action.  \n  \n12.    However, the Board has the discretion not to make an order as to costs under \nRegulation 21(3) of the Regulations.  \n \n13. After considering the submissions of Applicants and the Respondent and taking into \naccount all the circumstances, the Board orders that t here be no order as to costs.  \n \n  \nDated this   6th   day of March  2013  \n \n \n \n \nMR ALFONSO ANG  \nDeputy President  \n \n \nMR RICHARD TAN MING KIRK  \nMember  \n \n \nMR TANG TUCK KIM  \nMember  \n \n \n \n \n "

Mun Hean Building (MCST No 1024) is a development comprising 19 lots. The \nshare values of the various lots are not the same a nd the total share value is 1000   \n \n2. Eight of the nine respondents ( ie all except for MCST Plan 1024) are owners of 8 \nlots with a total share value 584. The total share value  of the remaining 11 lots is \n416. Accordingly whilst the eight respondents own less than half of the total of the \n19 lots they have 58.4% of the total share value.  \n \n3. Mok Wing Cheong  (MWC) , Mok Wai Hoe  (MWH) , Mok Wing Tak,Mok Wai Chung,  \nMok Wing Fai are representatives of 5 companies who ar e the owners of 5 of the \n11 lots and their total share value is 233   \n \n4. As on 22/07/2011 MWC  was the chairman of MCST Plan No 1024.  \n \n5. By way of a letter dated 22/07/2011 to the secretary of MCST Plan 1024, seven of \nthe eight respondents requested for an EOGM   \n \n(i) to call for a vote of no confidence in MWC as chairman of MCST Plan 1024 \nand  \n(ii)  to elect a new chairman with immediate effect  \n \n6. Hereafter the eight respondents will be referred to as the respondents\u2019 camp  (RC) \nand Mok Wing Cheong, Mok  Wai Hoe and the owners of the 11 lots not owned by \nthe RC will be referred to as the applicant\u2019s camp (AC ). \n \n7. Whilst Mun Hean Singapore Pte Ltd (the authorised representative was Mok Wing \nCheong)  was the named applicant in this application  it was not real ly in dispute 3 \n that this  was a dispute between AC and the RC as to who should be recognised \nas the valid council members of MCST Plan 1024 . \n \n8. A notice of council m eeting dated 02/08/11 was given to all council members \ninforming of a meeting to be held on 05/ 08/11 at 10.00am. The meeting was  \n\u201cregarding the requisition dated 22/07/11 from some SPs\u201d  \n \n9. All the council members attended the meeting on the 05/08/11and the letter from \nthe RC was discussed.  \n \n10. It was not in dispute that at the meeting MWC tendered his resignation.  \n \n11. In the minutes of the meeting it was inter alia  recorded  \nIn order to avoid the expenditure of unnecessary time and money for the MCST in \nhaving to conduct an EOGM, the Council re ele cted the appointment of office \nbearers, by show of hands:  \n12. MWH was elected as chairman in place of MWC and he sent out a lett er dated \n05/08/11 to all the subsidiary proprietors  informing everyone of the election of the \nnew chairman, secretary, and treasurer  and council members. He also informed \nthat  \n\u201cResults from the re -election have effectively diffused the two resolutions \nstipulated to call for the above EOGM and rendered them redundant. The council \nhas therefore decided that there will not be any need to  call an EOGM\u201d  \n13. By way of a letter da ted the 13/08/11 the RC  inter alia  informed that they were of \nthe view that the meeting on the 05/08/11 had no \u201c force or effect \u201d and gave notice \nthat they would be proceeding to convene an EOGM under paragraphs 14(1) and  \n14(4) of the First Schedule of the Building Maintenance and Strata Management \nAct (the Act). This was held on the 05/09/11 . \n \n14. The members of AC and RC attended the meeting. The following events took place  \n \nMWH as chairman ruled that motions requested by the RC  \u201cto call for a vote of no \nconfidence in MWC as chairman for MCST 1024\u201d and \u201cto elect a new chairman for \nMCST 1024 with immediate effect\u201d to be out of order as MWC was no longer the \nchairman and a new chairman had already been elected at the council me eting on \nthe 05/08/11. Following this he declared the meeting closed at 11.00am  \n \nThe members of RC did not accept MWH as the chairman of the MCST and elected \nLim Chee Yong to chair the meeting. They then proceeded to vote on the 2 motions \nviz \u201cto call for a vote of no confidence in MWC as chairman for MCST 1024\u201d and \n\u201cto elect a new chairman for MCST 1024 with immediate effect\u201d The voting was by \npoll and both were passed. Lim Chee Yong was elected chairman  \n 4 \n 15. The 27th AGM of MCST 1024 was convene d by the 26th council of MCST  1024 and \nit was held on the 06/09/11.  \n \n16. MWH was the chairman of the 26th council of MCST 1024.ie it was the council led \nby MWH that convened the 27th AGM  \n \n17. Whilst the members of AC and RC  attended the AGM which was held at 10.0 0am \nat the Quality Hotel Balestier Road, there were two sets of minutes recorded at the \nmeeting i.e. whilst the two factions were at the same venue at the same time, they \nwere having meetings separate from each other.  \n \n18. The minutes of the meeting of the AC  were signed by MWH. There was no \nsignature on the minutes of the RC . It was prepared for and on behalf of the RC  by \na David Tham from Dawson Property Management Pte Ltd.  \n \n19. In the minutes of the meeting signed by MWH it was inter alia  recorded.  \nHe (MWH) told members that as chairman he is responsible for the activities \ncarried out at the premises of the meeting and to have order he was going to make \na proposal.  \n(MWH) proposed that since some subsidiary proprietors did not recognise him as \nthe chairman of the management corporation, in order to ensure order in the \npremises that he would occupy half of the meeting room to conduct the 27th AGM \nand the rest of the members who did not recognise him as the chairman of the \nmanagement corporation can use the other  half of the room to carry out whatever \nactivities they want but without causing any disruption or disturbance to the 27th \nAGM. (MWH) asked the members of the management corporation for their views \non his proposal  \nSarah Tham (from RC) proposed that as ther e was a difference in opinion as  who \nis the chairman of the management corporation; to let the members present vote \nby poll as to who will be the chairman of the meeting.  \n(MWH) disagreed and told the meeting that as the chairman of the management \ncorporat ion he would proceed to conduct the 27th AGM in accordance with Clause \n6 of the First Schedule of Act  \nMr Charles (from RC) attempted to call members to vote on who should be \nchairman of the 27th AGM  \nMWH told him that he could not do that as the chairman of  the management \ncorporation is present and will conduct the 27th AGM. MWH invited whoever who \nrecognised  him as  chairman of the management corporation to participate  in the \n27th AGM  \n20. It was an agreed fact that the meeting of the RC  chaired by Lim Chee Yong was \nheld at another corner of the room . \n 5 \n 21. In the minutes prepared by David Tham it was inter alia  recorded that 7 council \nmembers were voted in as the 27th council of MCST 1024 with Vic E Charles was \nvoted as chairman, Sarah Tham a s secretary and Peter Koh as treasurer . \n \nAnalysis and submissions  \n \n22. In this case the applicant has  applied for the following orders against the \nrespondents:  \nThat the election  of Lim Chee Yong as chairman  during the EOGM on the 5th \nSeptember 2011 conducted by the respondents  during the said EOGM be \ninvalidated;  \nThat the election of Mr VE Charles and the election of the council members during \nthe AGM  on the 6th September 2011 conducted by the respondents  during the \nsaid AGM be invalidated  \n23. In view of the orders sought ie invalidation of  the appointment of Lim Chee Yong \non the 5th September and invalidation of VE Charles as  chairman and unnamed \ncouncil members  on the 6th September  the Board had before the arbitration hearing \nnoted that Lim Ch ee Yong and VE Charles were not  parties to the proceedings. \nThe Board had accordingly queri ed the applicant  as to whether it was  appropriate \nthat the applicant  should be seeking for the orders to b e made against the named \nrespondents.  \n \n24. The applicant has since informed that the orders have been sought against the \nnamed respondents because it was they who voted for Lim Chee Yong to be the \nchairman on the 5th September 2011 and for VE Charles and the unnamed to be \nthe chairman and council members of the 6th September 2011 . \n \n25. As there was no application for the Board to dismiss the application under the \nprovisions of S 116 or any other provision of the Act the Board considered that it \nwould not be out of order for the Board to make a decision on the applications.  \n \nThe resignation of MWC and appointment of MWH at the council meeting on \n05/08/11 : \n26. As mentioned earlier, it was not in dispute that MWC had tendered his resignation \nat the meeting and it was also not in dispute that at the meeting MWH was elected \nas chairman. It was however the submission of the respondents that the \nresignation of MWC an d election of MWH were invalid because the RC  dispute s \nthat there was proper notice for the meeting and alleged that there was a breach \nof paragraph 4 of the 2nd Schedule of the Act viz that the notice did not contain a \nproper agenda; only 2 days instead o f 3 days notice was given and the place of \nthe meeting was not stated.  6 \n  \n27. The notice did in fact give particulars of the date, place and time of the meeting as \nthe following was provided in the notice \u201c Council Meeting on 5th August @ 10.00am  \n\u201cCouncil members, please meet at lift lobby on the 1st level of Mun Hean Industrial \nBuilding at 51 Kim Keat Road\u201d . \n  \n28. With regard to the agenda and whether there was two or 3 days notice it was the \nsubmission of the respondents that 2 of the council member who were part of the \nRC viz Lim Chee Yong and Ong Lye Chun had only 2 days notice and that the \nparticulars with regard to the agenda did not give any information that a \nreplacement chairman was going to be elected . \n \n29. Whilst there are provisions enabling the Board to  invalidate resolutions made at \nmeeting s of a management corporation (S 103), it does not appear that the Act has \nprovisions for the Board to invalidate resolutions made at council meetings. The re \nwere no submissions from the respondents on this point and the Board will assume \nthat S 103 can  be applicable to council meeting because decisions made at council \nmeetings \u201c shall be the decision of the management corporation\u201d (S 58 of the Act).  \n \n30. Accordingly the Board considered the submissions of the respondents on the basis \nthat decisions made at council meetings can be invalidated under S 103 in cases \nwhere provisions of the Act in relation to meetings have not been complied with.  \n \n31. Under S 103 of the Act an order to invalidate must be made  when failure to comply  \nhad prejudicially affected another and compliance would have resulted in a failure \nto pass the resolution or affect the election. If failure to comply had not prejudicially \naffected anyone or compliance would not have resulted in failure to pass the \nresol ution Board can refuse  to invalidate even if there was failure to comply.  \n \n32. It was the submission of the respondents that inadequate particulars with regard \nto the place of the meeting could have prevented interested subsidiary proprietors \nfrom attending. As noted above there were particulars with regard t o place and \ntime and even if subsidiary proprietors  other than council members wanted to \nattend, a perusal of paragraph 5 of the 2nd Schedule will however show that while \nsubsidiary proprietors  have a righ t to attend council meetings they have no right to \naddress the meeting except with permission of the council.  \n \n33. With regard to the council members who were part of the RC the Board was of the \nview that even if it could be found that the notice was defectiv e they were not \nprejudicially affected as they attended the meeting and had every opportunity to \nobject to anything raised.  \n \n34. The respondent s also referred to S 58(3) of the Act which provided:  \nA council shall not make a decision on any matter if, before the decision is made, \nnotice in writing has been given to the secretary of the council by subsidiary \nproprietors who altogether own not less than one third of the lots in the subdivided 7 \n building concerned that the making of the decision is opposed by those  subsidiary \nproprietors and any decision if made by the council shall have no force or effect.  \n35. It was the submission of the respondents that the AC had convened the meeting \non the 5th August 2011 to discuss the resignation of MWC as chairman and the \nelection of MWH in his place and RC  had not been given an opportunity to object \nto this.  \n \n36. The meeting on the 5th August was convened  \n\u201cregarding the requisition dated 22/07/11 from some SPs\u201d  \n \n37. It was not convened to discuss the resignation of M WC and the election of MWH. \nThe resignation and election  took place after the meeting was convened.  \n \n38. The Board considered whether the resignation of MWC and the election of MWH \nwas in any way contrary to S58 ( 3) of the Act.  \n \n39. RC had given notice that they wanted the convening of an EOGM.  \n \n(i) to call for a vote of no confidence in MWC as chairman of MCST Plan \n1024 and  \n(ii) to elect a new chairman with immediate effect.   \n \n40. At the meeting of council on the 05/08/11 MWC tendered  his resignation as \nchairman. The resignation would have been invalid if it was in breach of S 55(5) of \nthe Act which provided  \n\u201cNotwithstanding anything in this Act, a person appointed to the office of \nchairperson, secretary or treasurer of the council of  a management corporation \nshall not resign his office until (a) a  meeting of the council is first convened for the \npurpose of appointing another person to fill his vacancy; or (b) a general meeting \nis first convened for the purpose of electing another perso n to fill his vacancy, and \nany purported resignation or vacation of office in breach of this subsection shall \nbe deemed to be invalid.\"   \n41. The remarks of t he Minister for National Development on 19th October, 2004  at \nthe 3rd reading of the BUILDING MAINTENANCE AND STRATA MANAGEMENT \nBILL with regard to this provision were as follows:  \n \nBasically, we want the office bearer who wishes to resign to make the effort to \nannounce to the general body to give notice that he is going to resign, and also to \nhave them put on notice that  nobody is stepping forward .  \n \n42. MWC had in this  case  not resigned in circumstances where no one was stepping \nforward. He had resigned in the midst of a council meeting and there was another \nwho was prepared to assume the office. The Board was of the view that the \nresignation was not out of order.  \n 8 \n 43. Following the resignation of MWC as chairman there was a vacancy in that o ffice \nand as provide d for in S 54(3) of the Act the council proceeded to appoint MWH as \nchairman.  \n \n44. The Board could not find that there was a breach of S 58(3) as t here was no notice \nin writing objecting to the resignation of MWC as chairman or the appoint ment of \nMWH as chairman . \n \n45. It was also the submission of the respondents that MWH\u2019s appointment as \nchairman at the meeting was invalid because it was not in accordance with SS \n54(1)(e) and 54(3).  \n \n46. S 54(3) provides as follows:  \nUpon the occurrence of a vacancy in the office of the chairperson, secretary or \ntreasurer or other member of the council, otherwise than by reason of subsection \n(1)(e) or (f) the council may appoint a person eligible for election as such to fill the \nvacancy and any person so  appoi nted shall hold office for the balance of his \npredecessor\u2019s term of office.  \n47. S 54(1) (e) provides as follows:  \n \n(1) A person who is the chairperson, secretary or treasurer or a member of a \ncouncil shall vacate his office as such member - (e) at the end of the nex t annual \ngeneral meeting at which a new council is elected by the management \ncorporation or upon the election at a general meeting of another person to that \noffice, if earlier. (S 54(1)(f) is not relevant)  \n \n48. MWC did not in this case vacate his office a chairman under the provisions of S \n54(1)(e) or S54(1)(f) of the Act and the council members at the meeting were \nallowed under S 54(3) to elect MWH when the vacancy of the office of the \nchairperson occurred when MWC tendered his resignation.  \nThe election of Lim Chee Yong at the EOGM on the 05/09/11:  \n49. It was the submission of the applicant  that it was in order that MWH as chairman \nof the MCST should chair the meeting as this was provided for in paragraph 6 of \nthe Fi rst Schedule of the Act and as chairman it was in ord er for him to rule on  \nmotion s submitted to be out of order (P aragraph 4 of the First Schedule of the \nAct). \n \n50. It was the submission of the respondents that MWH had no basis to rule that the \nmotions were ou t of order as it was provided in P aragraph 4 of the First Schedule \nthat he could do this if the motions if carried  \n(a)  would conflict with the provisions of the Act  \n(b)  would conflict with the by -laws of Mun Heng Building  \n(c)  would be unlawful  \n(d)  would be unenforceable.  \n 9 \n 51. It is provided in Paragraph 4 of the First Schedule that the chairman may rule on \nmotions being out of order, \u201cif he considers \u201d that the motions if carried will have \nthe consequences as spelt out above. It can be noted that the consider ations are \nsubjectiv e and it was  not for  the RC  to carry on and proceed on the basis that he \nhad no right to chair the meeting and that his rulings were of no effect . As submitted \nby the applicant , which we agree,  any challenge to his ruling should be take n by \nway of an application to the Strata Titles Boards  \n \n52. The Board is of the view that even if there were valid grounds for challenging the \nrulings of MWH at the EOGM the rulings should be considered to be valid until \nfound to be otherwise by an appropriate  authority.  The continuation of the meeting \nby the RC after the chairman had closed the meeting and the election of Lim Chee \nYong after the meeting had been closed was not in order.  \n \n53. It was the submission of the applicant that  Lim Chee Y ong\u2019s election as c hairman \nby the RC was also in breach of the Act.  \n \n54. As noted above the vote for Lim Chee Yong as chairman was by poll and not by \nlots \n \n55. Paragraph 8 of the First Schedule provides:  \nEach person entitled to vote on an election of members of the council or \nexecutive committee shall have one vote in respect of each lot which he is \nentitled to vote  \n56. The applicants submitted that the voting of Lim Chee Yong as chairman wa s \ncarried out by RC  after MWH had closed the meeting and accordingly the \nmembers of the AC did n ot participate in the voting. If  they had , Lim Chee Yong \nwould not have been elected because the AC had 11 votes as against the  RC\u2019s  8 \nvotes.  \n \n57. It was submitted by the respondents that the election of Lim Chee Yong who was \nalready a council member , to the office of chairman by poll was not out of order \nbecause whilst P aragraph 8 of the First Schedule makes reference to voting of \ncouncil members by lots it does not make any reference to office bearers  ie \nchairman, secretary and treasurer and pointed out that S  55(2)  of the Act did not \nrequire that the chairman, secretary should be elected by lots . \n \n58. SS 55(2) and (3) of the Act  provide : \nS 55(2) Where the chairperson secretary and treasurer of the council have n ot \nbeen appointed by the management corporation at its annual general meeting, the \nmembers of the council shall, at the first meeting of the council after they assume \noffice as such members, appoint the chairperson, secretary and treasurer of the \ncouncil.  10 \n S 55(3) A person - (a) shall not be appointed to the office of chairperson secretary \nor treasurer of the council unless he is a member of the council; and....  \n59. Only council mem bers can be appointed to be  a chairma n, secretary and treasurer \nand voting on elections of council memb ers must be in accordance with P aragraph \n8 of the First Schedule  i.e. by lots   \n \n60. S55(2)  is of no assistance to the respondents as it provides for council members \nto appoint  a chairman, secretary or treasurer \u201cwhere the ch airperson, secretary or \ntreasurer have not been appointed by the management corporation at its annual \ngeneral meeting,...\u201d .The provision does not allow for a chairman to be elected by \npoll. \n \n61. It was also the submission of the respondents that it was not relevant that the voting \nwas by lots or by share value because the decision was unanimous in that all of \nthe members of the RC who participated in the voting voted for Lim Chee Yong.  \nThe submiss ion ignores the fact that the chairman who was supported by the AC \nhad closed the meeting and it was on that basis that they  had not voted. There was \nevery likelihood that Lim Chee Yong would not have been elected if all who were \neligible to vote had voted  and the voting was by lots.  \n \nThe election of VE Charles and council members at the AGM on 06/09/11 : \n62. VE Charles and the council members supported by RC were elected in a meeting \nchaired by Lim Chee Yong. This meeting was held on the same day and at the \nsame place as the AGM  of the 2 7th coun cil of MCST 1024.  \n \n63. It was the submission of the respondents that Lim Chee Yong was the validly \nelected chairman and MWH had no authority to preside; that the meeting chaired \nby Lim Chee Yong was the valid meeting and the failure of the AC to attend this \nmeeting \u201c is their mistake\u201d  \n \n64. It was inter alia the submission of the applican t that the elections of the office \nbearers and council members elected was by the RC was invalid as the elections \nwere by poll.  \n \n65. It was not  in dispute that the e lections were by poll and not by  lots. It was however \nthe submission of the respondents that the mode of the elections did not invalidate \nthe elections as the voting was unanimous.  \n \n66. The elections of the council members in the meeting of the RC was not in \naccordance with Paragraph 8 of the First Schedule and whilst the Board can in \nspite of this refuse to invalidate the elections, the Board cannot find that the failure \nto comply with paragraph 8 of the First Schedule in this case had no t prejudicially \naffected  the members of the AC. \n 11 \n 67. VE Charles and the council members supported by RC were elected in a meeting \nchaired by Lim Chee Yong. This meeting was held on the same day and at the \nsame place as the AGM of the 27th council of MCST 1024.   \n \n68. The 27th AGM of MCST 1024 was convened by the 26th council of MCST1024 and \nMWH was the chairman of the 26th council of MCST 1024. It was the council led \nby MWH that convened the 27th AGM. MWH had chaired the meeting and council \nmembers were elected. The voting was by lots.  \n \n69. Until a competent authority had declared that MWH was not the chairman of the \n26th council , it was not in order for the RC, because they did not recognise MWH \nas the chairman of the 26th council to ignore his office and the meeting that he was \nchairing and hold what they considered to be the valid AGM of the 27th council of \nMCST 1024. The election s held at the meeting chaired by Lim Chee Yong were \nnot valid.  \n \n70. The Bo ard accordingly orders:  \n \n(i) That the election of Lim Chee Yong as chairman during the EOGM on the 5th \nSeptember 2011 conducted by the respondents during the said EOGM be \ninvalidated;  \n \n(ii) That the election of Mr VE Charles and the election of the council members \nduring the AGM on the 6th September 2011 conducted by the respondents \nduring the said AGM be invalidated . \n \n  Dated this  18th   day of   February     2013.  \n \n        Mr Francis George Remedios  \n        Deputy President  \n \n       \n        Dr Lim Lan Yuan  \n        Member  \n \n                \n        Prof Teo Keang Sood  \n        Member  "

The Applicant, Boo Show Lih, is the subsidiary proprietor of # XXX Gloria Mansion \n(\u201cthe premises\u201d) and the Respondents, Soh Poh Foh and Choo Yeng Si, are the subsidiary \nproprietors of #XXX Gloria Mansion. The Applicant\u2019s premises are situated directly below the \nRespondents\u2019.2 \nSTB 100 of 2012 \u2013 GLORIA MANSION  2. In July 2012, the Applicant complained of leakages/seepage in the ceiling of their  \npremises from the Respondents\u2019 premises and filed an application and sought the following \norders (as amended on18 February 2013):-\n(i) to stop the seepage coming from the kitchen of # XXX\n(ii) waterproof of the kitchen of #XXX and that this waterproofing should last at \nleast 5 years\n(iii) repair and rectify the kitchen\n(iv) to employ a mutually agreed contractor to diagnose and repair  the damage\n(v) repair the damage to the kitchen wooden cabinet\n(vi) reimburse $500 being the fee paid to the Strata Titles Board and whatever fee to \nbe incurred during the hearing.\n3. After 3 unsuccessful attempts to resolve the matter, the dispute proceeded for a hearing.\n4. The Applicant was represented by counsel and 2 witnesses gave evidence on her behalf \nnamely her son Oei Hsin Hsi and Kenneth Hugh Jones, a Chartered Surveyor, The Respondents \nacted through her son, Soh Kee Meng, and evidence was adduced through another of her son, \nSoo Jee Kwang.\nTHE EVIDENCE  \nApplicant\u2019s e vidence \u2014Oei Hsin Hsi  \n5. Oei Hsi n Hsi in his evidence in chief stated that t he Applicant\u2019s unit had previously\nexperienced recurring leakage , which had been resolved amicably  with the Respondent s. This\nwas confirmed in paragra ph 23 of Soh Jee Kwang (Respondent s\u2019 witness) AEIC where he stated\nthat on 29 October 2011 and 20 April 2012  the Respondent s had \u201cacceded to the Applicant\u2019s\ndemands to carry out repairs. \u201d\n6. However  in respect of the current dispute  before the Board, the Respondent s had failed\nand or refused to carry out the rectification. In paragraph 8 of his AEIC he confirmed that in\n\u201cearly part of July 2012, my mother and I noticed that there were leaks from the kitchen ceiling,\nespecially where stains appear in topmost parts  of the kitchen cabinet which is in contact with the\nceiling\u201d.  Attempts at settlement with the Respondent s proved futile.\n7. His evidence in chief was not questioned nor disputed by the Respondent s.3 \nSTB 100 of 2012 \u2013 GLORIA MANSION  Expert witness \u2014Mr Kenneth Jones  \n8. The Applicant engaged  Kenneth Jones, a Chartered Building Surveyor from the firm\nRobinson Jones Associates Pte Ltd in connection with the interfloor leakage. In his report\ntendered by him at the he aring he noted the following damage to the Applicant\u2019s premises.\n8.1 \n8.2 \n8.3 Kitchen : Blistered  paintwork  and water  stains  to wall and soffit  of RC slab to \nkitchen  near the washing  machine  tap, indicating  the presence  of absorbed \nmoisture within the fabric of the wall and soffit in those locations. Since moisture \nin the wall would move downward due to gravity and there are no concealed \nwater pipes at high level within unit # XXX, the moisture source from the \nRespondents \u2019 unit  was responsible for  the damage.  This damage  was noted  to be \nconfined to a localized area of the kitchen away from the cooking area, indicating \nthat the damage  was  not caused  by moisture  in the  air and/or  cooking.  Moisture \ndamage  was  also  noted on parts  of the kitchen  cabinet  abutting  the soffit  of the \nceiling where the blisters occurred. \nBedroom 1 : Small dark stains a t severa l locati ons on the soffit of timbe r false \nceiling.  \nBedroom 2 : Stains on the soffit of timber false ceiling a t the abutme nt to party \nwall between the bedroom and the living area.  \n9. Kenneth Jones\u2019 conclusion after the inspection was as follow s:\n\u201c\u2026I carried out an inspection on the Claimant\u2019s unit on 29 April 2013 to ascertain that \nthe water seepage to the Claimant\u2019s unit in the areas inspected originated from the \noutside of the unit. In fact, I was able to ascertain that they originated from the unit \nupstairs, which is the Respondents\u2019 unit.\u201d  \n10. Kenneth Jones was denied access to the Respondents\u2019 unit, and so was unable to\ndetermine the precise origin of the leakage.  He however made recommendations regarding\nrepairs and estimated the cost to be between $3000 and $5000.\n11. During cross -examination, Kenneth Jones did not agree that the damage to the\nApplicant\u2019s ceiling in the kitchen was because of water being delibera tely applied onto to the\nceiling , He also discounted that it could have been caused by any other factors other than the\nwater coming from the unit above the Applicant\u2019s premises. He could not ascertain the cause of\nthe leak as he did not have access to the  Respondent s\u2019 premises  but was of the opinion that the\nleak emanated  from the Respondents \u2019 premises .4 \nSTB 100 of 2012 \u2013 GLORIA MANSION  Respondent s\u2019 Evidence \u2014Soo Jee Kwang  \n12. The Respondent s\u2019 only witness is Soo Jee Kwang. The main thrust of his evidence was\nthat the Applicant  had unreasonably reneged  on a private settlement agreement when he had\nacted in a \u201cgood neighborliness\u201d manner. He also maintained that he had refused to allow the\nApplicant the opportunity t o conduct a survey  on his premises. Amongst the  reason s he gave  for\nthe refusal which are  found in paragraphs 20 and 21 of his AEIC was t hat he was not obliged to\ngive the Applicant the name of his surveyor .\n13. The Respondent s had not adduced any evidence to show that the leaks did not emanate\nfrom his premises and up to the date of the hearing failed to produce any evidence or expert\nevidence to rebut the presumption under Section 10 1(8) of the Building Maintenance and Strata\nManagement Act (BMSMA) .\nDECISION/ORDER  \n14. From the evidence adduced before the Board, it was clear that the App licant\u2019s premises\nhad suffered damage from leak that emanated from the Respondent s\u2019 premises. As to precisely\nwhat caused the leak and what needed to be done to rectify the problem, the Board was unable to\ncome to a conclusion as the expert witness of the Applicant was not able to have access to the\npremises.\n15. The Respondent s had als o failed to adduce any evidence which wo uld assist the Board in\nany way and had failed to rebut the presumption in section 101(8) of the Building Maintenance\nand Strata Management Act (BMSMA).\n16. The presumption in Section10 1 (8) states that :\n\u201c(8) In any proceedings  under this section with respect to any alleged defect in a lot  or\nin any common property or limited common property situated immediately (whether\nwholly or partly) above another lot  or any common property or limited common property,\nit shal l be presumed, in the absence of proof to the contrary, that the defect is within that\nlot or common property or limited common property, as the case may be, above if there is\nany evidence of dampness, moisture or water penetration -\n(a) on the ceiling tha t forms part of the interior of the lot , common property or\nlimited common property, as the case may be, immediately below ; or\n(b) on any finishing material (including plaster, panel or gypsum board) attached,\nglued, laid or applied to the ceiling that forms part of the interior of the lot, common \nproperty or limited common property, as the case may be, immediately below .\u201d 5 \nSTB 100 of 2012 \u2013 GLORIA MANSION  17. In addition to the presumption under Section 101(8) (BMSMA) the Applicant \u2019s case was\nsupported  by the fact she had an  expert opi nion through Kenneth Jones. Kenneth Jones\u2019s\nevidence was adduced and we accept ed his evidence that the leak emanated from the\nRespondent s\u2019 premises. The Board ha d no other evidence to the contrary.\n18. Under the circumstances, we accept ed that the Applicant ha d made out the case. The\nBoard however will confine the leaks to the kitchen premises as this was the basis of the\nApplicant and not the whole house as argued by the Applicant. In this aspect we accept the\nRespondent s\u2019 argument that the damage should be con fined to the kitchen .\n19. After considering all the above the Board accept ed the evidence of the Applicant and\naccordingly made the following orders:\na) The Respondent s shall engage a contractor to carry out effective and proper\nrepairs to all the leakages t o the Applicant\u2019s kitchen.\nb) In relation to (a) above, the Respondent s shall within 5 days, engage and pay Mr\nKenneth Jones of Robinson Jones & Associates Pte Ltd or any other mutually\nacceptable professional engineer/architect/building surveyor (\u201cthe Professional\u201d)\nto:\n(i) carry out an inspection of the water leakage into  the Applicants\u2019 unit with\na view towards establishing the cause thereof;\n(ii) to identify and define the scope of remedial works to rectify the water\nleakage (\u201cthe Works\u201d) in both the Applicant\u2019s and Respondents\u2019 units;\n(iii) to prepare a report for the perusal of the Applicant and the Respondents,\nwhich report and recommendation the Applicant and the Respondents\nagree to abide by;\n(iv) to recommend to the Respondent s an experienced contractor to carry out\nthe Works;\n(v) to supe rvise the execution of, and certify the completion of the Works, and\nto inform the Applicant on completion of the Works ,\nc) The Respondent s shall provide the Professional with a copy of the Order within\n14 days hereof.6 \nSTB 100 of 2012 \u2013 GLORIA MANSION  d) The Respondent s shall employ and pay t he recommended Contractor to execute\nand complete the Works under the direction and supervision of the Professional.\ne) The Respondent s shall ensure that the Works are completed within two months of\nthe Order herein.\nf) In the event the Respondent s fail  to ful ly comply with any of the terms of this\nOrder, the Applicant may proceed to take all reasonable steps to give effect to the\nsame, and recover all costs incurred as a debt from the Respondents.\ng) The Respondents shall pay the Appl icant costs fixed at $3000 and reasonable\ndisbursement.\nDated this 25th day of June 2013  \n_________________________________  \nMR ALFONSO ANG  \nDeputy President  \n_____________________ ________  \nMR CYRIL SEAH  \nMember  \n_____________________________  \nMR TONY TAN  KENG JOO  \nMember  "

The parties in STB 52 of 2011; STB 64 of 2011; STB 65 of 2011 and STB 66 of 2011 are:\na) Management Corporation Strata Plan No 2746 (\u201cMC\u201d), the MC of the development\nknown as Toh Guan Centre (\u201cthe estate\u201d);\nb) Sia Boon Chye (sole proprietor of Boon Kee Battery Service) the subsidiary\nproprietor of #XXX in the estate (\u201cBoon Kee\u201d);\nc) Tay Geok Min/ Julian Tay Lit Oon (proprietors of Tee Guan Trading Services) the\nsubsidiary proprietors of #XXX in the estate (\u201cTee Guan\u201d); and\nd) Lim Kim Hwee/ Lim Saw Eng (proprietors of Gin Huat Industrial Supplier) the\nsubsidiary proprietors of #XXX in the estate (\u201cGin Huat\u201d).\nBACKGROUND: \n2. At the 7th Annual General Meeting (\u201cAGM\u201d) held on the 26 June 2010, the following by\nl\naws were passed (\u201cthe by-laws\u201d):-\n11.0 BY LAWS (SPECIAL RESOLUTION) \n11.1 Use of forklift within toh guan centre \nIt was unanimously resolved that the following by laws effective from 1st July 2010 \nbe adopted: - \na. Forklift is strictly for use at the loading and unloading area.\nb. There should be strictly no driving of forklift along the driveway for\ntransportation of goods between units.\nc. The Management Corporation shall be empowered and entitled to impose a\nfee of $200.00 per incident for any violation of By Laws on the use of\nForklift.\nProposer: Mr Loh Chin Poh (#XXX) Seconder: Mr Allen Tan (#XXX ) \n11.2   Servicing of vehicles at the driveway \nIt was unanimously resolved that the following by la ws effective from 1st July 2010 \nb\ne adopted: - \na. There shall be strictly no servicing of vehicles along the driveway\n(including but not limited to the common area in front of the unit)\nb. The Management Corporation shall be empowered and entitled to impose a\nfee of $200.00 per incident for any violation of By Laws on the \u201cServicing\nof Vehicles at the Driveway.\u201d\n3. The by-laws were passed pursuant to Section 32(3) of the Building Maintenance and Strata\nManagement Act No 47 of 2004 (\u201cthe Act\u201d).\n4. In the four applications, the MC has applied for Boon Kee to pay \u201c all outstanding fines \u201d\nimposed by the MC pursuant to Boon Kee\u2019s \u201c breaches of By Laws \u201d (STB 52 of 2011). ItSTB 52/ 64/ 65/ 66 of 2011 \u2013 Toh Guan Centre 3was alleged that Boon Kee and/or its customers had since the passing of the by-laws \nbreached the by-laws and at the time when STB 52 of 2011 was filed, it was alleged that \nthe amount due and payable was $30,000.00. \n5. Boon Kee, Tee Guan and Gin Huat (\u201cthe SPs\u201d) have applied for the abovementioned by-\nlaws to be repealed (STB 64 of 2011, 65 of 2011 and 66 of 2011).\n6. There were other prayers in the various applications and it was in the course of mediation\nproceedings agreed that the Board should decide on the validity of the by-laws before\ndealing with any of the other matters as the determination of the Board on this point would\nhave a significant and critical effect on all the other matters. Inter alia a finding that if the\nby-laws are invalid, it would result in a dismissal of the MC\u2019s claim against Boon Kee for\nthe \u201coutstanding fines\u201d and orders in favour of the SPs for the by-laws to be repealed.\n7. Section 106 of the Act provides for the Board to declare a by-law to be invalid where a\nmanagement corporation does not have the power to make such a by-law.\nSP\u2019S SUBMISIONS \n8. It was the submissions of the SPs that the MC did not have the power to make the by-laws\nas the MC is \u201c not entitled at law to impose or exact any fines for non observance \u201d of by-\nlaws because there are no express or implied provisions in the Act that allows for this and\nit \u201cis clear that Parliament did not intend\u201d that a management corporation should have\nsuch a power.\n9. It was submitted that a management corporation which was a creature of statute could only\nderive its powers from the statute which created it and the power to make by-laws viz\nSection 32(3) did not provide for the imposition of fines for non observance of by-laws.\n10. Under Section 32(3) of the Act, by-laws could be made for \u201c...the purpose of\ncontrolling and managing the use or enjoyment of the parcel comprised in the strata\ntitle plan ...\u201d\n11. In connection with the submission that Parliament did not intend that management\ncorporations should have power to impose fines, it was submitted that if Parliament\nintended that a management corporation could make by-laws providing for the imposition\nof fines, this would have been expressly provided for in the Act. The SPs referred to\nvarious pieces of legislation which illustrated that whenever it was intended that fines\nand/or imprisonment could be imposed for breaches of the subsidiary legislation, this was\nalways provided for in the enabling legislation.\n12. It will be sufficient to set out the provisions in two of the eight pieces of legislation\nidentified:-\nROAD TRAFFIC ACT \n(\nCHAPTER 276) \nGeneral provisions as to rules  \n140. \u2014(1) The appropriate Minister may make rules \u2014STB 52/ 64/ 65/ 66 of 2011 \u2013 Toh Guan Centre 4(a) for prescribing the language and script in which any traffic sign, notice,\nrecord, application, return or other documents shall be written;\n(b) for any purpose for which rules may be made under this Act\n(c) for prescribing anything which may be prescribed under this Act\n(d) generally for the purpose of carrying this Act into effect; and\n(e) for prescribing penalties (not exceeding those provided by section 131) for any\nbreach or failure to comply with any such rules.\nBUILDING CONTROL ACT \n(CHAPTER 29) \nPower of Minister to make regulations  \n29L.   The Minister may make regulations for giving effect to the provisions of this Part  \n and for the due administration thereof, and, in particular, for or with respect to all or any \nof the following matters: \n(d) prescribing offences in respect of the contravention of any regulations made under\nthis section, and prescribing fines, not exceeding $10,000 or imprisonment which\nmay not exceed 12 months or both, that may, on conviction, be imposed in respect\nof any such offence;\n(e) prescribing any matter which is required under this Part to be prescribed.\n13. There are no provisions in the Act which allows for a management corporation to impose a\nfine for the breach of a by-law. As opposed to the fact that there are no provisions in the\nAct providing for the imposition of fines/ penalties by  management corporations,  the Act\nprovides for by-laws to be enforced or breaches restrained by way  of an application to\nthe court. This evidences that Parliament has given due consideration as to how by-laws\nshould be enforced or restrained.\n14. Section 32(10) of the Act provides as follows:-\nThe management corporation or subsidiary proprietor , mortgagee in possession, lessee or\noccupier of a lot shall be entitled to apply to the  court \u2014\n(a) for an order to enforce the performance of or r estrain the breach of any by-law\nby; or\n(b) to recover damages for any loss or injury to pe rson or property arising out of the\nbreach of any by-law from,\nany person bound to comply therewith, the managemen t corporation or the \nmanaging agent. \n1\n5. It was further submitted that if it is in order that a management corporation can make by-\n laws that provides for the imposition of fines for the breach of the by-laws, this can result\nin an \u201c unfettered discretion to impose fines and the quantum of such fines\u201d , i.e. there \nwould be no limit on the amount of the fine that can be imposed for the breach of a STB 52/ 64/ 65/ 66 of 2011 \u2013 Toh Guan Centre 5by-law and this could not have been intended by Par liament. The pieces of \nlegislation referred to also showed that whenever fines and/or imprisonment can be \nimposed for breaches of subsidiary legislation, the enabling legislation always provided \nthe maximum fine or imprisonment that can be imposed. There are no such provisions \nin Section 32 of the Act. \nMC\u2019S SUBMISSION \n16. As noted above, the application of the MC in STB 52 of 2011 was for Boon Kee to pay\n\u201coutstanding fines\u201d pursuant to breaches of by-laws that \u201c empowered and  entitled \u201d the\nMC to impose a \u201c fee of $200 per incident for any violation of By Laws...\u201d.\n17. In their written submissions, the MC\u2019s position was that (paragraph 4 of the written\nsubmission) whilst it appeared that \u201c the imposition of the fee is no different from the\nimposition of a fine and/or a penalty  as a deterrent .\u201d (i.e. whilst it was termed a \u201cfee\u201d in\nthe by-laws, a fine was being  imposed), the MC was, in the by-laws, not seeking to impose\na fine or a penalty, but was  seeking to impose \u201c liquidated damages for breach of\ncontract\u201d  (paragraph 9 of the written submission). (In  further written submission  titled as\n\u201cReply Submission\u201d,  the MC expanded on their earlier submissions and elaborated that\nthe by-laws sought to impose valid fees for actions  committed in  contravention 11(1)(a),\n11(1)(b) and 11(2)(a) and were not fines, i.e. penalties that were imposed for unlawful acts.)\n18. It was then submitted that the MC can \u201c c reate by laws a breach of which would result in\nliquidated damages and which the MC can claim \u201d.\n19. The MC had in this case, imposed fees for contravention of the by-laws that were  passed\npursuant to Section 32(3) of the Act and by the time the MC filed its application (viz\nSTB 52 of 2011) to the Board, the fees had accumulated to $30,000.00, i.e. the Board\nwas being asked to enforce the MC\u2019s imposition of fees that had been imposed for\nbreaches of by-laws.\n20. In paragraph 25 of its written submissions, the MC sought to crystallise the issues and\nidentified the issues as follows:-\na) Whether the MCST has the requisite powers (statutory or otherwise) to pass by-\nlaws imposing fee and/or penalties on defaulting subsidiary proprietors for breach\nof by-laws;\nb) Whether the additional by-laws passed by the MCST (principally in imposing a fee\nfor every breach of by-law) are valid; in other words, whether the said by-laws are\nconsistent with the legislative scheme set out in the BMSMA and BMSMR (as\ndefined below); and\nc) Whether the fees imposed in the event of a breach of the relevant by-laws are to be\nconstrued as a penalty or liquidated damages, and whether the by-law imposing a\nfee of $200 ought to be enforceable.\n21. The MC summarised the history of the Act and concluded that management\ncorporations can only have powers that are granted to it by the Act and the Act hasSTB 52/ 64/ 65/ 66 of 2011 \u2013 Toh Guan Centre 6provided for a management corporations to have duti es and powers that can \neffectively benefit the participants of the strata scheme. The MC went on to submit that by-\n laws are intended for the regulation of conduct and behaviour and are essentially \nstatutorily constituted contracts between the management corporation and the subsidiary \nproprietors and between the subsidiary proprietors inter se.  \n22. The MC also noted that previously it was provided in  Section 41(16) of the Land  Titles\n(Strata) Act (\u201cLTSA\u201d) for a fine not exceeding $1000 to be  imposed for a breach of a\nstatutory by-law. This provision was not retained when the Act was passed in 2004 as it\nwas the intention of the legislature to de-criminalise various offences connected with the\nmanagement of strata developments, where these do not pose a serious threat to the general\npublic. It was then submitted \u201c Thus, only civil remedies remain available to an innocent\nparty in the event of a breach of by-laws prescribed under the BMSMR (and the BMSMA).\nThese civil remedies include the right to apply to court under section 32(10) of the\nBMSMA (which is similar to section 41(14) of the LTSA) for \u201can order to enforce the\nperformance of or restrain the breach of any by-law\u201d and \u201cto recover damages for any\nloss or injury to person or property arising out of the breach of by-law\u201d respectively.\u201d\n23. The MC referred to by-laws passed by other estates where administrative fees and charges\nwere imposed to cover expenses and losses and fees were charged for the release of wheel\nclamps fastened onto illegally parked vehicles and also referred to statutory by-law 3(1) in\nconnection with obstruction of common property, and statutory by- law 18(1) in\nconnection with fire and other hazards and submitted that the by-laws, i.e. 11(1)(c) and\n11(2)(b)  were not inconsistent with the statutory by-laws. The MC sought to equate these\nwith the order that it was seeking in STB 52 of 2011.\n24. The MC submitted that, when there is a provision in a contract that provided for payment\nof monies for breach of the contract, this would be enforceable if it is a genuine attempt to\nestimate in advance the loss which the innocent party will likely suffer from the breach. As\nthe by-laws are statutory contracts between the MC and the SPs, it was submitted that the\nfee of $200 for breach of the by-law was a genuine pre-estimate of the loss or damage\ncaused by the breach. The MC referred to the tests spelt out by Lord Dunedin in Dunlop\nPneumatic Tyre Company Ltd v New Garage and Motor Company Ltd [1915] AC 79 and\nto the decision of the Court of Appeal in CLAAS Medical Centre Pte Ltd v Ng Boon Ting\n[2010] 2 SLR 386, where Chao Hick Tin JA inter alia pronounced \u201c ...it is for the party\nbeing sued on the agreed sum to show that the term is a penalty...\u201d and submitted that it\nwas for the SPs to prove that the fee of $200 was a penalty.\n25. It was submitted that the fee of $200 was not a penalty but a genuine pre-estimate of the\ndamages suffered because considerable manpower, time, effort and resources were\ninvolved before imposition of the fees. The MC referred, inter alia, to the fact that breaches\nhad to be monitored and the keeping of records with details before fees could be imposed.\n26. It was submitted that the MC has the requisite statutory powers to do all things reasonably\nnecessary for the enforcement of by-laws including the imposition of fees in\nconnection with breach, as this would be consistent with the legislative intent for MCs\nto be a self regulatory body with broad powers of administration.STB 52/ 64/ 65/ 66 of 2011 \u2013 Toh Guan Centre 727. Finally it was submitted that without a power to claim for fees for breach of by-laws,\nthe only remedy available to the MC would be to take each and every SP to court or\nthe Strata Titles Boards (\u201cSTB\u201d) every time there is a breach. This would be time and\ncost consuming and the courts and STB would be flooded with such applications.\nOBSERVATIONS OF THE BOARD (in connection with the submissions of the SPs and the \nMC) \n28. The submissions of the SPs are quite clear.\n29. With regard to the MC, what it was claiming from Boon Kee has been referred to as\noutstanding fines, fees and liquidated damages and the MC started by submitting that the\nMC was in the by-laws not seeking to impose a fine or a penalty, but was seeking  to\nimpose \u201c liquidated damages for breach of contract\u201d.\n30. From the above, one could conclude that the MC was conceding that it does not have the\npower to pass by-laws that imposes a fee/fine/penalty for breach of the by-laws and is now\nseeking an order from the Board for Boon Kee to pay liquidated damages amounting to\n$30,000.00. There was however, no application for an amendment of the order that it was\nseeking in STB 52 of 2011.\n31. With regard to the submission that management corporations can \u201c create by laws a breach\nof which would result in liquidated damages and which the MC can claim \u201d, it is not clear\nwhat exactly the submission was but if it was being submitted that a management\ncorporation can seek to recover damages for breach of by-laws, this is specifically\nprovided for in Section 32(10). As illustrated above, the subsection provides that\nmanagement corporations, subsidiary proprietors, mortgagees in possession, lessees and\noccupiers of lots are \u201c entitled to apply to the court... to recover damages for any loss or\ninjury to person or property arising out of the breach of any by law ....\u201d. It was not \nsubmitted that the provision can be interpreted as allowing for or could be relied upon by \nthe MC to pass the by-laws in this case. \n32. With regard to the issues identified by the MC (as stated in paragraph 20 above),\na) here the issue has been correctly identified;\nb) this is not quite clear. It is correct that the Act provides for management\ncorporations to pass by-laws for the purpose of controlling and managing the use\nand enjoyment of the parcel comprised in the strata title plan, and management\ncorporations can do everything that is reasonably necessary for the performance of\nits duties [Subsections 32(3) and 29(2)(b) of the Act] but, as to whether it follows\nfrom this that a management corporation can pass a by-law providing for the\nimposition of a penalty for the breach of the by-law, this is not spelt out in any of\nthe provisions of the Act. It appears to be the MC\u2019s submission that by virtue of\nSubsections 32(3) and 29(2), the MC can pass by-laws providing for the imposition\nof penalties for breach of the by-laws.\nc) it appears to be the submission that the by-laws should not be repealed because\nwhat was being claimed can be construed as  liquidated damages and not a penalty.STB 52/ 64/ 65/ 66 of 2011 \u2013 Toh Guan Centre 8The Board is of the view that  for any by-law to b e enforceable, it has to be valid \nand if it is not validly made, it will be of no consequence whether what is being  \nclaimed is a penalty or liquidated damages. \n33. From the submissions of the SPs and the MC, it did not appear that there was any dispute\nthat for a by-law to be valid, it had to be a by-law that was authorised by the Act.\n34. On the part of the SPs, it was submitted that the by-laws in this case were not\nauthorised within the ambit of Section 32(3) and on the part of the MC, whilst it was\nnot conceded  that the by-laws were not authorised within the ambit of Section 32(3), it\nwas submitted that the by-laws in this case were consistent with the legislative intent for a\nmanagement corporation to be a self regulatory body with broad powers of\nadministration and they were empowered to create by-laws, a breach of which would result\nin liquidated damages.\n35. By-laws are subsidiary laws. In the case of McEldowney v Forde  [1971] AC 632,  Lord\nDiplock said that where the validity of subordinate legislation made pursuant to powers\ndelegated by Act of Parliament to a subordinate authority is challenged, the court  has a\nthree-fold task: first to determine the meaning of the words used in the Act of Parliament\nitself to describe the subordinate legislation which that authority is authorised to make,\nsecondly to determine the meaning of the subordinate legislation itself and finally to\ndecide whether the subordinate legislation complies with that description.\n36. In this case, it is Section 32(3) that empowers a management corporation to make by-\n laws. The by-laws that can be made under this provision are by-laws \u201c for the purpose\nof controlling and managing the use and enjoyment of the parcel comprised in the strata \ntitle plan including all or any of the following purposes:....\u201d  The purposes are listed \nat (a) to (i) of the subsection. There are no phrases/provisions or words like:- \n(i) \u201c for prescribing penalties for any breach or failure to comply with any such by\nlaws\u201d;\n(ii) \u201cby laws made under this section may provide that any contravention thereof shall\nbe punishable\u201d;\n(iii) \u201c the prescribing of penalties in respect of the contravention of any of the by laws\nmade under this section, and prescribing of fines, not exceeding $...\u201d;\n(iv) \u201cthat any contravention of any of the by laws shall be punishable with....\u201d; \n(v) \u201c The by laws may provide that a contravention of specified provisions thereof\nshall be punished with ...\u201d .\n37. The Board agrees with the submission that by-laws are essentially statutorily constituted\ncontracts between the management corporation and the subsidiary  proprietors and\nbetween the subsidiary proprietors inter se. The MC\u2019s submissions on the law in\nconnection with liquidated damages may well be sound, but in this case this is not helpful\nor relevant. The MC in this case is seeking an order from the Board for Boon Kee to pay\nfees pursuant to  breach of a by-law which the SPs say is an invalid by-law in that the Act\ndoes not provide for the making of such  a by-law .STB 52/ 64/ 65/ 66 of 2011 \u2013 Toh Guan Centre 938. This was not an application for that payment of damages for breach of contract under\nSection 32(10) of the Act or any other law in a civil court where unlike an arbitration\nhearing before the Board, rules of evidence must be applied. By virtue of Regulation 18(1)\nof the Building Maintenance and Strata Management (Strata Titles Boards) Regulations\n2005 (\u201cBMSMR\u201d), a Board is not bound to apply the rules of evidence. An action for\ndamages payable for breach of contract is not the same as an application for a\nmonetary payment imposed for a breach of an invalid by-law.\n39. With regard to the submission that the MC has the requisite statutory powers to do all\nthings reasonably necessary for the enforcement of by-laws, including the  imposition of\nfees in connection with breach as this would be consistent with the  legislative intent for a\nmanagement corporation to be a self regulatory body with broad powers of administration,\nthe Board agrees that the MC has requisite statutory powers to do all things necessary for\nthe enforcement of by-laws. However what it can do, can only be what the law allows it to\ndo. It cannot do what is not allowed by the law. The fact that providing for imposition of\nfees for breach of by-laws may make enforcement of by-laws easier, cannot by itself\njustify such provision. It is also not correct that without such a power, the management\ncorporation\u2019s role would be nugatory and ineffective as there can be other ways to\npersuade and/or ensure that subsidiary proprietors comply with by-laws, for example, the\nBoard is aware that it is not unknown that some management corporations have by-laws\nproviding for the application of wheel clamps on vehicles that are improperly parked.\n40. In connection with the MC\u2019s reference to administrative fees and charges imposed by\nvarious bodies to cover expenses and losses and the MC seeking to equate these with the\norder that it is seeking in STB 52 of 2011, the short answer to this is that what it is\nseeking in STB 52 of 2011 is not an administrative fee or a charge for any service rendered,\nor expense incurred or loss suffered.\n41. A \u201cfee\u201d is a payment made to a professional person or to a professional or public body in\nexchange for advice or services or is a charge made for a privilege such as admission\n(Concise Oxford English Dictionary, 11th Edition). It is not in order to impose a fine or any\nother kind of penalty for a prohibited act and term the imposition of the fine/penalty, a\n\u201cfee\u201d.\n42. In connection with statutory by-laws 3(1) and 18(1), it can be immediately noted  that\nthere are no statutory by-laws providing for a monetary or any other kind  of penalty for\nbreach of the identified by-laws. As such, whilst the MC\u2019s by-laws 11(1) (a) and (b) and\n11(2)(a) would be not be inconsistent with the statutory by-laws, the same cannot be\nsaid for by laws11(1)(c) and 11(2)(b).\n43. It was noted earlier that the MC did not concede that it did not have the power to pass the\nby-laws in this case. However with the submission that it was seeking to impose\nliquidated damages for breach of contract, this, in effect amounted to a concession that\nthe by-laws empowering and entitling it to impose a fee of $200 for each and every\nviolation was  invalid. The MC did not specifically submit that the by-law empowering\nand entitling the MC to impose a \u201cfee\u201d of $200 for each and every violation is a good by-\n law and that the Board can order \u201cfees\u201d imposed to be paid. Instead it was submitted that STB 52/ 64/ 65/ 66 of 2011 \u2013 Toh Guan Centre 10the \u201cfees\u201d are liquidated damages and that this is what it wants the Board to order. As \npointed out earlier, there was, beside the fact that there was no amendment to the \napplication in this case, the fact that claims for liquidated damages in a court are not the \nsame as applications before the Board. \n44. It would not be out of order to refer to Section 33 of the Act which allows for management\ncorporations to make by-laws conferring on subsidiary proprietors\u2019 exclusive use and\nenjoyment/special privileges of the whole or part of common property for various  periods\nupon conditions, including payment of money, specified in the by-laws. Depending on the\nperiod of exclusive use and enjoyment/special privileges, different kinds of resolutions\nare required for the passing of the by-laws (ordinary resolution for periods not exceeding\none year, special resolution for periods not exceeding three years and 90% resolution for\nperiods more than three years). Accordingly, it might not have been out of order for\nthe MC to have made by-laws allowing the SPs to use common property i.e. allowing\nforklifts on the driveway between units and servicing of vehicles on driveways in\naccordance with Section 33. It was, however, not the submission of the MC that by-\n laws 11(1)(c) and 11(2)(b) were by-laws made under Section 33 of the Act. The Board is \nof the view that they were not made under this provision. \n45. The Board considered the words in Section 32(3) of the Act, which allows management\ncorporations to make by-laws \u201c...for the purpose of controlling and managing the  use or\nenjoyment of the parcel of comprised in the strata title plan...\u201d  and Section 29(2)(b)\nof the  Act which allows an MC to \u201c...do all things reasonably necessary for the\nperformance of its duties under this Part and the enforcement of the by laws...\u201d There is\nnothing in Section 32(3) of the Act to indicate that an MC can pass by-laws providing for a\nmonetary penalty to be imposed when the by-laws are breached. There is nothing in the\ntwo provisions that is in any way similar to the provisions in the various pieces of\nlegislation referred to by the SPs which illustrated that whenever it was intended that\npenalties could be imposed for breaches of the subsidiary legislation, this was always\nprovided for in the enabling legislation and the extent i.e. maximum penalties would also\nbe provided for. The Board is of the view that a finding that the by-laws in this case are\nvalid would be tantamount to a finding that Parliament had entrusted the MC with\nundefined and unlimited powers of imposing charges/penalties/fines liquidated damages\nupon subsidiary proprietors for breaches/contravention of the by-laws.\n46. Even when it is in order for management corporations to levy contributions in accordance\nwith Section 39(1) or (2) of the Act (i.e. for regular maintenance and keeping in good and\nserviceable the common property fixtures, fitting and other property held by or on behalf\nof the management corporation; common expenses of the management corporation;\npayment of insurance premiums and all other liabilities incurred or to be incurred by or on\nbehalf of management corporations in carrying out its powers, authorities, duties and\nfunctions under the Act ), there are no provisions allowing for management corporations to\nimpose fines or any other kind of monetary penalty for non-payment of the contributions.\n47. Management corporations can only proceed in accordance with Sections 40(8), 40(9) and\n40(10) of the Act, i.e. lodge a claim with a Small Claims Tribunal or prosecute the\ndefaulting subsidiary proprietor for an offence of non-payment of the contribution.STB 52/ 64/ 65/ 66 of 2011 \u2013 Toh Guan Centre 1148. It will be noted that even in Section 136 of the Act which provides for regulations to be\nmade by the Minister (as opposed to a management corporation) for carrying out the\npurposes and provisions of the Act, there are specific provisions viz subsections (f) and\n(g) providing for the payment of fees when it is in order for fees to be levied and for\nfines to be imposed in Section 136(4) for contravention of the regulations.\n49. It is also relevant to refer to Regulation 11 of the BMSMR which provides as follows:\n11.\u2014(1)  For the purposes of section 47 of the Act, the following fees shall be payable to a\nmanagement corporation or subsidiary management corporation for the following services:\n(a) supplying the name and address of the\n chairperson, secretary and treasurer of the\nmanagement corporation or subsidiary\nmanagement corporation and of the managing\nagent under section 47(1)(a) of the Act$5 \n(b) management corporation making available\nfor inspection any document referred to in\nsection 47(1)(b) of the Act$15 per hour or part thereof at each \nattendance \n(c) subsidiary management corporation\nmaking available for inspection any document \nreferred to in section 47(1)(b)(ii) or (iii) of \nthe Act, in so far as these relate to the\nsubsidiary management corporation or its\nlimited common property$15 per hour or part thereof at each \nattendance \n(d) certifying any matter referred to in section\n47(1)(c) of the Act$25 per certificate \n(e) making copy under section 47(4) of\nthe Act of any document referred to in\nsection 47(1)(b) of the Act50 cents per page. \n50. The provision illustrates that when Parliament allowed for management corporations to\nlevy fees; it spelt out and limited the maximum fees that can be charged.\n51. It would be incongruent that Parliament when seeking to allow the Minister to make\nregulations providing for payment of fees for identified purposes and imposition of fines\nfor contravention of regulations had specifically spelt these out in the enabling provisions\nof the Act would choose not to provide for this in Section 32 of the Act, if it intended to\nallow management corporations to impose fees/penalties/fines for breach of by-laws\nmade by management corporations. In fact, in the Second Reading of the Building\nMaintenance and Management Bill on 19 April 2004 (Session No. 1 Volume No. 77\nSitting No. 16), the then Minister for National Development, Mr Mah Bow Tan, said in\nregard to the decriminalising of non-compliance of certain offences (including \u201cthe breach\nof the by-laws by SPs\u201d) that \u201c Notwithstanding that such non-compliance is decriminalised,\nthe aggrieved party could still seek recourse through the Strata Titles Boards or take\ncivil action via the courts \u201d.STB 52/ 64/ 65/ 66 of 2011 \u2013 Toh Guan Centre 1252. Parliament could not have and did not entrust management corporations with undefined\nand unlimited powers of imposing charges/penalties/fines or any other monetary payments\nupon subsidiary proprietors for breaches/contravention of by-laws made under Section\n32(3) of the Act.\n53. Accordingly, the Board declares the MC\u2019s by-laws 11(1)(c) and 11(2)(b) to be invalid\nand it is ordered that the by-laws be repealed.\n54. The claim of the MC for Boon Kee to pay \u201c all outstanding fines \u201d for \u201c breaches of By\nLaws \u201d is dismissed.\nDated this 11th day of April 2012 \nMR REMEDIOS F.G \nDeputy President \nMR RICHARD TAN MING KIRK \nMember \nMR LIM LEE MENG \nMember  "

Orchid Park Condominium. Singapore 768449. \nAlthough Tye Boo Lan was no t named in the original application , she appeared a t the \nhearing and was added as a Responden t before the hearing commenced , withou t any \nobjections being raised. \nThe Applicant s are in this application applying for an order : \n\u201cTo reimburse and claim for the cost of the damage done and all other costs incurred \nincluding all fees incurred involvi ng Strata Titles Board\u201d \nThe total amoun t claimed in the application filed on the 19/05/2011 was $3968.00 \n(repair and rectification by contractor s, $2568.00 ; transpor t an incidentals $900.00; \napplication fee payab le to the Strata title Boards $500.00). \nThe Responden ts deny tha t they are in any way responsible for the costs and damages \nsuffered by the Applicants. \nApplicant s\u2019 case \nMaria Koh Leena managed the uni t for the Applicants . \nShe gave evidence as follows: \nThe unit was tenanted to one Mdm Jiang Ying. On the 27 July 2007 , following a \ncomplain t from the tenan t that there was water dripping from the ceiling in the master \nbedroom toilet and the common toilet, she went and checked the unit and found that the \nceiling board s in both toilets were stained with water mar ks. She then removed the \naccess panel on the ceiling and found \u201cicicle had formed on the piping . There were also \nicicles on the ceiling slabs\u201d  \nPhotographs were taken and tendered in evidence to the Board. \nMaria Koh contacted the managemen t corporation (MC) abou t the seepage and the MC \nthen wrote to the Respondents.   \nTwo letters were written on the 24/04/08 and 23/07/08 by the MC to Mr Giam Cheok \nTiat informing him of the seepage in the Applicant\u2019s premises and that it was suspected 3 \nthat the seepage emanated from his master toilet. There was no response from the \nRespondents to the MC\u2019s letters.  \nIn Jan 2010 the Applicants engaged M/s General Waterproofing and Service Pte Ltd \n(GWS) to conduct an inspection and prepare an investigation report on the condition \nand state of the water seepage in the unit. \nLoh Wee Sheng, the investigator with GWS prepared his report on the basis of \ninspections at the Applicant\u2019s unit.  He was not able to access the R espondent\u2019s unit. \nHis findings in the report tendered in evidence were consistent with the photographs \nexhibited \nAs there was no response to the MC\u2019s letters the Applicant s then wrote to the \nRespondent s on the 18/11/10. \nThe letter was inter alia as follows: \nTo date you have been ignoring to respond and give reply despite several reminder \nletters earlier to you... please be informed that I will take necessary action including \nboth rectifying the problems as the existing drop ceiling gave way and posed hazard to \nthe safety of the tenants...have obtained quotation for the repair works... shall be fully \nborne by you. \nIn Dec 2010 the Applicants engaged M/s Tong Nee Contractor Pte Ltd to carry out \nrectification works. M/s Tong Nee rendered a bill for $2568.00 and this was paid by the \nApplicants.  \nIn the course of the hearin g it was revealed that the Applicant\u2019s (Anthony Koh) father , \nKoh Toh Nee and sister Maria Koh Leena were the shareholders of M/s Tong Nee. \nThere was however no evidence whatsoever that the charges in the bill rendered were \nnot in order \nOn the 15/08/11 Loh Wee Sheng inspected the A pplicants\u2019  unit and noted that grouting \nhad been done by M/s  Tong Nee. It was the evidence of Loh that whilst this had \nstopped the seepage, it was only a temporary measure. \nAt the close of the hearing of the case for the Applicants \u2019  the amount claimed was \nincreased to $5268.00. A sum of $1300.00 (costs for the attendance of Mr Loh) was \nadded to the original claim. \nThe Case for the Respondents . \nIt was the evidence of Giam C heok  Tiat that the seepage in the Applicant\u2019 s unit was \ndue t o \u201cserious overloading\u201d of his old air -conditioner. He did not dispute that there was \nstalactite formation in the Applicant\u2019s unit and said that this was due \u201c sign of an aging \nbuilding\u201d He was of the view it was due to rain water seeping in from the extern al wall or 4 \nsteam from a water heater condensing on a cold concrete ceiling that caused the \nformation of the stalactites in this case. \nOther than the bare opinion of Mr Giam Cheok Tiat no evidence was adduced to \nsupport his opinion. \nS 101(8) of the BMSMA provides as follows: \nIn any proceeding under this section with respect to any alleged defect in a lot or in any \ncommon property... it shall be presumed in the absence of proof to the contrary \nthat the defect is within that lot or common property...above  if there is any \nevidence of dampness, moisture or water penetration \u2013 \n(a) On the ceiling that forms part of the interior of the lot... immediately below\n(b) On any finishing material ...applied to the ceiling that forms part of the interior...of\nthe lot...immediately below.\nThe Board was in this case satisfied that the Respondents had not proved that the \nseepage in the Applicants\u2019  ceiling was not due to a defect in the Respondents lot.  \nThe Respondents  had been given a reasonable opportunity to attend to the defect \nand had not done so.  \nThe Board was satisfied that expenses had been incurred by the Applicants to \nrectify the seepage . Specifically, the Board was satisfied that the Applicants had \nengaged M/s Tong Nee to carry out rectification works in Dec 2010 and paid M/S  \nTong Nee $2568.00 for the works done. The Board   was of the view that the \nfollowing expenses were not unreasonably incurred: \n(i) $2568.00 paid to M/s Tong Nee Contractors Pte Ltd\n(ii) $500.00. Application fee payable to the Strata Titles Boards.\nThe Board was not satisfied that the claim for $900.00 for transport and incidentals \nhad been proved. There was no doubt that some transport and other expenses \nwould have been incurred before rectification works were done and the Board was \nof the view that it would be in order to allow for a sum of $100  for transport and \nincidentals. \nWith regard to the claim for $1300.00, for the attendance of Mr Loh Wee Sheng the \nBoard considered the professional status of Mr Loh Wee Sheng  - he was a \ngraduate from the Singapore Polytechnic (graduated in March 2011) ; the attendance \nwas to check on the renovation done;  if water seepage was continuing and \nattendance before the Board to give evidence. The Board was of the view that a \nsum of $700  would be reasonable. 5 \nThe Respondents are accordingly ordered to pay the Applicants $3868.00. \nThe Board will now hear parties with regards to costs. \nDated this  13th day  of October  2011. \nMr F G Remedios \nDeputy President \nMr Lai Huen Poh \nMember \nMr Richard Tan Ming Kirk \nMember "

She then applied to\nbe allowed to i) increase the height of the door which she said was too low for her\nforklift which had a high mast and ii) to construct a 2nd door, inter alia for easier\nentry/exit. Her applications were disapproved.\n5.Following the disapproval by the MCST, she tenanted the unit to a trading\ncompany and said she received complaints from her tenant which led her to write\nto the respondents on 01/07/08.\nFrontage of the above stated unit is misused -at our main door entrance \n-you place your security guard with all his desks, chairs, cabinets\noccupying a big area which the said warehouse unit could use for\ndeliveries, loading and unloading of goods etc\nAnd adjacent area to lifts the area of parking lots allotted to other users -\nis NOT according to BCA 's plan which showed/designated that area as \nthe parking for lorry/container for warehouse use! \nKindly revert as soon as possible. \n6.She did not receive a reply to the letter despite follow up letters and on\n17/09/2009 she filed an application with the STB.\n7.STB 57/2009 was an application filed by the applicant against SCMS Property\nManagement Pte Ltd (the managing agent) and MCST Plan No 1360 (the\nrespondents in this case). The applicant prayed for 3 orders including an order\nwith regard to the use of the lorry bay and for relocation of the car park lot\nallotted to her unit. She wanted a parking lot which would be convenient for her to\noversee and access. On 04/11/09 the following order was made\n\" ... by consent of both the Applicants and Respondents ordered that:-\n1.Lorry Bay 1 and 2 shall be used exclusively for lorries only; and\n2.The Respondents shall endeavour that no other vehicles are parked in\nboth Lorry Bay 1 and 2\"\nSTB 44 OF 20 IO -GUANG MING INDUSTRIAL BUILDING 3 FORM 10\n8. It is to be noted that the applicant in STB 57/2009 did not make any application\nwith regard to use of the lobby by the security guards. The Board in STB 5712009\ndid not make any order with regard to the application for relocation of the allotted\ncar park lot.\n9. On or about June 2009 the applicant was engaged in moving items from premises\nin Defu Lane to the unit. On 1l/06109 she said that access to the door opening of\nthe unit was impeded by the \"the security guards' furniture, personal effects, sign\nboard etc taking up half the lobby width. .. \" She informed that on that day\n\"another proprietor from level 4 delivering out 6 units via the cargo lift, taking\nup the whole doy...\"\n10. It was also the evidence of the applicant that the door to the unit was obstructed\nby \"the piping of a sprinkler siren connection and the overhang of the stack of\naluminium letterboxes instead of the hose reel duct...\"\nI l. There was no prayer in this application for an order in connection with the\nsprinkler siren connection and letterboxes.\n12. It was also the evidence of the applicant that in BCA drawing No\nKGG/83/GMD/AC5 the height of the door to the unit was higher than the existing\ndoor by 0.51 m.\n13. In the affidavit of her evidence in chief, applicant also referred to a stray cat that\nhad climbed to the mezzanine level via the aluminium vents facing Lorry Bay I and\ncar park lot 15. To prevent further intrusions she \"seel<s to secure this problem in\nalternate remedy such as replacing the vents wtth fire-rated door... \"\n14. There was no prayer in this application, for an order to replace the vents.\n4 STB 44 OF 20 I O - GUANG MING INDUSTRIAL BI.IILDINGFORM 10 \n15.In connection with the car park allotted to the unit, the applicant said that the\nallotted car park was located at the main door of unit #XXX. The gist of her\nevidence in connection with this praye r was that the allocated car park was not\nconvenient for her to use and she wanted the allotted car park to be relocated '.'for\naccess and to be able to oversee from the same side as door entrance. \"\n16.At the hearing before the Board the applicant informed that she wanted to use the\ncar park to park her forklifts.\n1 7. The application in this case was filed on 25/08/2010 and it is the case for the \napplicant that she is entitled to the orders prayed for under SS 108, 111 and 114 of \nBuilding Management and Strata Management Act. Cap 30C (BMSMA). \n18.Under S 108 of the Act the Board can, where any amount levied or proposed by a\nmanagement corporation is excessive or inadequate or manner of payment is\nunreasonable, make orders for payments of different amounts or orders for\npayments in a different manner.\n19.S 111 of BMSMA provides for dissatisfied applicants to apply to Board in\nconnection with applications in connection with improvements in or upon a lot or\nan alteration to the common property that have been UNREASONABLY refused.\n20.S 114 of BMSMA provides for orders for entry into a lot. Only management\ncorporations (i.e SPs cannot apply) can apply to the Board for an order for an SP\nto allow the MC to access his lot for the purpose of carrying works.\n21.It is to be noted that SS 108 and 114 are not applicable in this case.\nRespondent's case \n22.Mr Sum Kok Meng the maintenance officer employed by the respondents was the\nonly witness called by the respondents. His evidence was as follows:\nSTB 44 OF 20 IO -GUANG MING INDUSTRIAL BUILDING FORM IO\nEncroachment of the lift lobb),\n23.There was no encroachment of the lift lobby. It was afact that there was a table\nand a chair that were used by the security guards in the lift lobby. Prior to the\napplication in this case the guards had hung their clothes and had personal effects\nat that place. When the case was being mediated before the hearing the security\nguards were directed to keep the place tidy and they have since removed clothing\nand personal effects. Security guards are provided for the benefit of all the\noccupants of the building and the location in the lobby which fronts the main gate\nprovides the best vantage point for monitoring activities at the bultdtng. \"The\nsecurity guard post has been there ever since TOP was obtainedfor the building\"\n24.It was also the evidence of Mr Sum that there has not been any changes made to\nthe structures or installations (including letter boxes and fire alarm bells) on the\nconrmon property.\nErection of a 2nd Door\n25.In connection with the application for a second door, Mr Sum said that the\napplicant had proposed that this be situated in front of the lorry bay and car park\nlots. There was also a fire breeching in-let system for use by the SCDF at the\nlocation. It was his evidence that it was not possible for a door to be located there.\nAdjusting the height of the existing door\n26.In connection with the application to adjust the height of the door, it was the\nevidence of Mr Sum that the condition of the door was as it was when the building\nwas handed over to the management corporation by the developer ie there has not\nbeen any changes ever since the building was completed and no one has ever been\nallowed to alter their main entrances.\nRe allocate car park\n27.1\\/k Sum referred to the fact that this had been prayed for previously and that no\norder had been made by the Board in STB 57/2009. Mr Sum further informed that\ncar park lots were allotted even before the management corporation had been\nconstituted (unit numbers are written on the lots) and said that the management\ncorporation had no power to reallocate car park lots.\n6STB 44 OF 20 I O _ GUANG MING INDUSTRIAI- BTJILDINGFOR.M 10\nConsideration of the evidence\n28. It will be in order to first of all deal with the submission made by the respondents\n(in the Opening Statement) that the applicant had no basis for making this\napplication because similar issues were raised in STB 3212010 (filed on\n0810712010).\n29. The application in STB 3212010 was against SCMS Property Management Pte Ltd\n(the managing agent) and not against the respondents in this case. The doctrine of\nres judicata is not applicable.\n30. It was also submitted that this application be dismissed because there were\noutstanding maintenance contributions amounting to $14853.50 due from the\napplicant. S 116 (d) of the BMSMA was cited in support of this submission. The\napplicant did not dispute that there were outstanding contribution due from her.\nShe informed that payments had not been made because incorrect statements had\nbeen submitted to her.\nS 1 16(d) of the BMSMA provides that\nA Board may dismiss an application under this part if -\n(d) in the case of an application made by any subsidiary proprietor of a\nlot, the applicant has not paid all contributions levied and payable in\nrelation to the lot under this Act.\n31. It is to be noted that dismissal is not mandatory when contributions are\noutstanding. Considering the fact that the applicant had her reasons for not payrng\n(it is not the decision of this Board that her reasons were valid) and that the\nrespondents had commenced a suit in the Subordinate Courts to recover the\noutstanding contributions, the Board was of the view that the Board should not\ndismiss the application on this ground.\nEncroachment and usurping of the lift lobblr\n32. It was the case for applicant that positioning of the security guards at the lobby\nwith their desks, chairs and cabinets interfered with deliveries and the loading and\nunloading of goods to her unit. She referred to the occasion in June 2009 when\nshe was moving items and access to her door was impeded by the security guards'\nfurniture. It was noted that on that day another subsidiary proprietor was making\ndeliveries and using the cargo lift. There was very little doubt access would have\n7 STB 44 OF20IO - GUANG MING INDUSTRIAIBUILDINGFORM IO\nbeen affected when more than one delivery was taking place at the same time.\nOther than this occasion there was no evidence of the applicant's access being\nimpeded.\n33. The respondent's case with regard to the location of the security guards was that\nsecurity guards are provided for the benefit of all the occupants of the building and\nthe location in the lobby which fronts the main gate provides the best vantage\npoint for monitoring activities at the building. It was also the evidence of Mr Sum\nthat the security guards had been positioned at that location ever since the building\nobtained its TOP ie until the complaint of the applicant there was never any\ncomplaint of obstruction being caused by the location of security guards.\n34. Under S 29(1) BMSMA it is the duty of the management corporation to control,\nmanage and administer the common property for the benefit of all the subsidiary\nproprietors. Positioning security guards at the best vantage point for monitoring\nactivities at the building would be in accordance with the duties of a management\ncorporation.\nErection of a 2nd Door\n35. The applicant had made an application for a second door to be constructed when\nshe purchased her unit. This was not approved because the applicant had proposed\nthat this be situated in front of the lorry bay and ca.r park lots. There was also a fire\nbreeching in-let system for use by the SCDF at the location and it was the evidence\nof Mr Sum that it was not possible for a door to be located there.\n36. Allowing the applicant to construct a second door would require the demolition of\na part of the existing external wall and allowing the applicant to construct a door\nfor her exclusive use. The external wall is corlmon property and it is provided in S\n33 (l)(c) of the BMSMA that a management corporation can only make a by-law\nconferring on a subsidiary proprietor the exclusive use and enjoyment of common\nproperty for more than 3 years (in this case the applicant was seeking exclusive\nuse of common property for an unlimited period) when there was 90oZ resolution.\nThere was no evidence in this case of such a resolution.\n37. S 1l I of BMSMA provides for dissatisfied applicants to apply to Board in\nconnection with applications in connection with improvements in or upon a lot or\nan alteration to the @rrmon property that have been unreasonably refused. There\nwas no evidence whatsoever that the management corporation's refusal of the\napplication for the second door was unreasonable.\nSTB 44 OF 20IO - GUANG MING INDUSTRIAL BTIILDING8FORM 1O\nAdjusting the height of the existing door.\n38. Whilst it was the contention of the applicant that there was a BCA drawing\nshowing that the height of the door to her unit was 0.5lm higher than the existing\ndoor, the evidence adduced did not show that this was so. It was also the evidence\nof Mr Sum that the condition of the door was as it was when the building was\nhanded over to the management corporation by the developer i.e there has not\nbeen any changes ever since the building was completed and no one has ever been\nallowed to alter their main entrances.\n39. Again as in the case for the application for the construction of a second door,\nincreasing the height of the existing door would require demolition of a part of the\nextemal wall and giving the applicant exclusive use of the part of the conrmon\nproperty that is removed. There was no evidence that a 90% resolution had been\nobtained for this and there was also no evidence that when the management\ncorporation disapproved the application for this, the disapproval was\nunreasonable.\nRelocation of the allotted car park\n40. The applicant did not find the location of the car park allotted to her unit to be\nconvenient for the parking of her forklifts and wanted the management corporation\nto allocate another car park to her. Mr Sum said that that the management\ncorporation did not have the power to do this because the car park lot had been\nallotted even before the management corporation had been constituted.\n41. The applicant would have been aware of the location of the allotted car park when\nshe purchased her unit and had proceeded with the purchase with this knowledge.\nThe applicant was now seeking that the management corporation should on her\nbehalf obtain consent of another subsidiary proprietor, specifically the subsidiary\nproprietor who had the use of car park No 15 (the car park that she identified as\nthe one that she wanted) to exchange car park lots with her.\n42. The applicant had previously made an application to the Board for such an order\n(STB 57/2009) and had not been granted the order and there was no valid reason\nwhatsoever for the Board in this case to make the order in her favour.\n9STB 44 OF 20 I O _ GUANG MING INDUSTRIAL BTIILDINGFORM 10\nApplication for Costs for wilful deprivation of allotted and common facilities.\n43.

The proxy forms had been deposited at least\n48 hours before the AGM and included proxy forms that had been detached from the\nAGM booklet that had been distributed to all SPs before the AGM as well as photocopies\nof the forms.\n3 All the forms ie detached from the booklet and the photocopied forms were\nsigned by the proxy giver. As the MCST did not have an official register containing the\nauthorised signatures of the SPs, an attempt was made to verifu that the proxy givers had\nin fact given the proxies that had been deposited at the management office.\n4 Due to time constraints all the proxy givers could not be contacted and the\nmanaging agent(MA) wanted to deny issuance of voting slips to the proxy holders where\nit had not verified if the proxy giver had in fact given and signed the proxy forms.\n5 Objections were raised as to this course of action and the chairman declared all\nthe proxy forms to be valid and accordingly no one was denied any voting slips\n6 The meeting commenced and after J items on the agenda had been dealt with, the\nmeeting dealt with item No 8 viz election of council members. There were 16 nominees\ncontesting for 9 council seats.\n7 At this point the right to vote of the proxy holders who held proxies from\nunverified proxies was raised again. They were however not denied the right to vote and\nall the votes cast were tallied and the following received the highest number of the votes\ncast: (1't Result)v\n2 STB 8 OF 20IO _ WOODGROVE CONDOMINIUM!t\n!I\nDavid Low\nTan Kok Siong\nSteven Lee\nEdward Meow\nTimothy Tan\nLoh Eng Siak\nLee Koh Young\nGoh Boon Beng\nJames Hoe\nMark Lim\nNeil Clarke\nToh Seng Hock\nGoh Say Yeow\nTina Lee\nKeith Sta Maria\nXiong Hua Li\n8 There was then a call to exclude the votes of the unverified proxies and the votes\n(28) were deducted from the first result.

There were calls for fresh\nelections without proxies; and for a recount and a re-tallying. The meeting was then\nadjoumed without any declaration being made with regard to the two resuits. The mrnutes\naJ STB 8 OF 20IO - WOODGROVE CONDOMINIUM..(P a\nof the meeting recorded that a ruling be sought from Building and Construction Authority\n(BCA) as to which set of results should be adopted.\nl0 On the 18109109 the Honorary Secretary of the Management Council sent an\nemail to the BCA inter alia, informing about the two sets of results and the circumstances\nunder which this had come about and advice was sought as follows:\nWO OD GROVE C OND O MINI AM.\nADJOURNMENT OF THE 7TH AI'IATUAL GENERAL MEETING DUE TO\nDISPATE ON VALIDITY OF PROXY VOTES\nWe wish to inform you that the 7'h AGM held on 5'h September has been\nadjourned to a date to befixed due to disputes over the validity of proxy votes ond\nwe have been directed to seek a rulingfrom you.\nThe issue\nl. There were received an unusually high number of proxy votes this AGM.\nSome of these Proxy votes were disputed as they could not be verified.\n2. At the AGM, disputes orose that the proxy totes may not be valid as the proxy\ngiver had not intended their proxy to vote for all resolutions including the\nelection of the council members.\n3.

The AGM was adjourned with no declaration of the elected members into the\nnew council.\nIt was directed that the council seek a rulingfrom BCA\nThe Management council would like to seek your advice as follows\ni.

The proxy form must be\nsigned by the subsidiary proprietor or his attorney duly authorized\nin writing and be deposited to the MC not less than 48 hours\nbefore the time for holding the meeting (Para 18 of the First\nSchedule to BMSM Act).\nApart from the above, the BMSM Act does not specify any other\nrequirement relating to the acceptance of the proryform.\nThe signature on the proxyform must be original. In essence, paragraphs\n17 & 18 of the First Schedule to the BMSM Act must be complied with. A\nproxy which is lodge after a meeting has been adjourned cdnnot be used\nat the adjourned meeting.\nIf the MC subsequently discovers there is fraud in the signature on the proxy\nform, the MC can report the matter to the police for investigation.\nii) Election qf council members\nif the motion for election of the council member has proceeded and voted\non at the last AGM, this motion should be considered as voted and\ndetermined at the last AGM. The subsidiary proprietor (SP) should be\ninformed of the outcome. If the result was not informed at the general\nmeeting, the MC should now inform all SPs the result of the election.\ni, Adjourned AGM-for -fresh election qf council members\nAs the casting of votes for the election of the council members have\nalready been done at the last AGM, a \"fresh election\" should not arise. If\nthere are disputes on the election of council members in relation to proxy\nforms that have been used by the proxy givers, any aggrieved SP can moke\nan application to the Strata Titles Board for an order to invalidate the\nelection, f the Board consider s that the provisions of the Building\nMaintenance and Strata Management Act have been complied with in\nrelation to the meeting of the MC.\n5 You are advised to consult your own solicitors on these matters.\n11. When the meeting resumed on the 24110109, the meeting was inter alia informed\nof the response from BCA and the chairman also intbrmed the meeting that a verification\nexercise had been carried out on the 08/09/09 where a survey was done on the SPs who4\nv\n6 STB 8 OF 2OIO _ WOODGROVE CONDOMINIUMaI\nhad signed the proxy forms. This was because of; inter alia, feedback received with\nregard to the manner in which proxies had been collected. The chairman also informed\nthat all the votes cast had been rechecked and irregularities discovered when the votes\nwere rechecked. He, inter alia gave an example of a proxy holder casting an extra vote\nagainst his registered number. He then announced that he could not accept 1't Result to be\nvalid.\n12. The minutes of the meeting recorded that this was unanimously supported and no\nobj ections registered.\n13 The minutes of the meeting then went on to record that notwithstanding legal\ntechnicalities relating to proxy forms the chairman informed that it was in the best\ninterest of the MCST to rule and declare the 2nd Result as valid. The chairman then\nproceeded to declare the 2nd Result as valid after the meeting had been asked if there were\nany objections to this and no objections were registered.\n14. The minutes also recorded that the 2nd Result (including the deduction of the 2\nirregular votes cast by Mr Edward Meow) was shown to all at the meeting and after the\nmeeting had been informed of the reason for the deduction of the 2 irregular votes, the\nchairman proceeded to declare the 2\"d Result as the officially accepted results of the votes\ncast.\n15. The minutes also recorded that the MA had asked if there was any objections to\nthe chairman's proposal and that all the original votes were displayed at the AGM venue\nfor members to check on the same. No objections were raised and the minutes recorded\nthat the chairman's proposal was unanimously carried.\n16 The number of votes for the 2nd Result as set out in paragraph 2.0 ofthe minutes\nof the meeting on the 24110109 was not exactly the same as that in the minutes of the\nmeeting on the 05/09/09.\n17. There was however no query with regard to this at the meeting. According to\nPhua Joo Hee the director of the Respondent's managing agent company the difference in\nthe numbers was due to the fact that out of the original 28 unverified proxy votes that\nwere deducted at the meeting on the 05109110, the votes of the proxy givers were, after it\nhad been verified that they had in fact given their proxies, added back to the results.v\n7 STB 8 OF 2OIO - WOODGROVE CONDOMINIUMt\n19. There was another motion for Mr Timothy Tan to be removed as a council\nmember on the grounds of conflict of interest when he was the treasurer of the MCST.\nThere were no objections, not even from Mr Timothy Tan himself, and the minutes of the\nmeeting recorded that this was unanimously carried.\nTHE APPLICATION IN STB No 8 OF 2010\n1. Meow Terk Meng, Edward\n2. Low Mong Eng\n3. Lee Koh Yong\n4. Loh Eng Siak, Louis\n5. Lee Tuan Hong, Steven\n6. Tan Kok Siong\nfiled application STB No 8 of 2010 and prayed for the following orders\n20. That the following proceedings of the adjourned AGM held on the 24/10/2009 be\nset aside:-\n(a) the recounting of the voting slips for the election of the new council members\nwas held by the out going council and the managing ogent in private when the\nvoting sltp were supposed to be sealed and in the safe keeping of the MA.\n@ the said recounting of the voting slips was also not done in the presence of all\nthe interested members who were nominated for council members, and hence\nthis recounting result was improperly resolved to be passed during the\nadjourned AGM.\n(c) the said recounting of the voting slips which were improperly resolved to be\npassed at the adjourned AGM had a dffirent result from the initial counting\nof the voting slips done at the AGM held on the 05/09/09. Hence the election\nof the curuent council, as result of the improper counting of the voting slips,\nwas improperly resolved to be passed at the adjourned AGM.\n1,1\\ +!...- .):--.,-1:1:.--!:.^-..- .^! t.r.. !])-...--.,--! t.f,..^.,, -,-) ]t,t-. .!-!,.-!!... .r-.^ )-.-.:--- al-^ (ul ttte ubquuttJtcutturt uJ lwr Luwuru lv7eUw UtlU iuTr iiiTloiiTy itiii Aufiiig iiie\nadjourned AGM.I\n8 STB 8 OF 2OIO- WOODGROVE CONDOMINIUMt\n18. Subsequently the chairman moved a motion for Mr Edward Meow to be removed\nas a member of the council and to be disqualified. This was because when the votes had\nbeen rechecked it was discovered that Mr Meow had cast and signed for 3 votes when he\nwas not registered as a proxy holder. There were 39 SPs present at the meeting and there\nwere 5 objections registered.t\n21. The Applicants informed that the orders were sought under SS 103 and 104 of the\nBuilding Maintenance and Strata Management Act 2004 (the Act).\n22. In view of the facts and the events preceding the filing of the application it was\nnot clear to the Board what it was that the Applicants wanted the Board to order. It will\nbe noted from the facts that there was never any \"recounting\" of voting slips.\nAccordingly the parties were in course of mediation requested to draft and file a joint\nopening statement and agree on the issues that they wanted the Board to determine. A\njoint opening statement \"Revised Joint Opening Statement\"(RJos) was filed on the\n29106110. It can be noted from the contents of this RIOS that the parties were not in\nagreement as to what it was that they wanted the Board to determine. There was the\n'Applicants' issues in dispute\" and the \"Respondent's issues in dispute\".\n23. As this was an application by the Applicants it was for the Applicants to be clear\nas to what orders they wanted the Board to make. The Applicants set out their issues in\ndispute as follows:\nThe Applicants' issues in dispute are:-\n(RJOS paragraph 35).\n(a) Whether the photocopied forms proxy forms with ink signatures\nwere valid proxy forms;\n(b) Wether the recounting of the voting slips should have been done\nby the MA on or about the 08/09/09 without the presence of the\napplicants or other SPs; and\n@ Wether the MCST may raise new resolutions to be passed at the\nadjourned AGM.\n(RJOS paragraph 50)\nThe issues therefore thatfall to be determined are:-\n(1) Whether, having adjourned the AGM for the purpose of clarifuing\nwith the BCA whether the photocopied proxy forms bearing\noriginal signatures were valid, whether the Respondents were\nentitled thereofter to : -\n9 STB 8 OF 2OIO- WOODGROVE CONDOMINIUMt\nunilaterolly seek clarifications from the subsidiary\nproprietors who granted proxies to the Applicants,'\nuniloterally conduct a recount of the votes cast at the\nAGM;\nunilaterally tabulate a third set of results of the voting\nbased on the clarifications;\n(2) Wether the above acts constituted breaches of the BMSA/L .\n(3) Wether the W's representatives were involved in seeking the\nclarifications;\n(4) If the MA's representatives were so involved, whether the same\nwas in breach of the BMSMA\n(5)Wether the said breaches would nullifi the results of the voting at\nrhe AGM\n(6) Wether the vofing slips or proxy forms were defaced in any way\npending the clarification being made to the BCA\n(8) Wether there was any basis to disqualifu any of the 26 disputed\nvoting slips given the clarification provided by the BCA;\n(e)LVhether the addition of new items for discussion at the adjourned\nAGM was proper, and if not, whether the same wos a breach of the\nBMSMA;\n24. As mentioned earlier the application was filed under SS 103 and 104 of the\nBMSMA. SS 103 and 104 of the BMSMA provides as follows:\nOrder to invalidate proceedings\n103. {1) Where, pursuant to an application by a subsidiary proprietor or first\nmortgagee of a lot, a Board considers that the provisions of this Act have not been\ncomplied with in relation to a meeting of the management corporation or subsidiary\nmanagement corporation, the Boar-d may, by order -(i)\n(ii)\n(iii)\nSTB 8 OF 2OIO - WOODGROVE CONDOMINIUM 10(7) Wether the results tallied at the Adjourned AGM were accurate,\nand were based on the votes collected at the AGM;t\n(a) invalidate any resolution of, or election held by, the persons present at the\nmeeting; or\n(b) refuse to invalidate any such resolution or election.\n(2) A Board shall not make an order under subsection (1) refusing to invalidate a\nresolution or election unless it considers -\n(a) that the failure to comply with the provisions of this Act did not prejudicially\naffect any person; and\n(b) that compliance with the provisions of this Act would not have resulted in a\nfailure to pass the resolution, or have affected the result of the election, as the case\nmay be.\nOrder where voting rights denied or due notice of item of business not given\n104. -{1) Where, pursuant to an application by a person under this section, a\nBoard is satisfied that a particular resolution would not have been passed at a\ngeneral meeting of a management corporation or subsidiary management\ncorporation but for the fact that the applicant -\n(a) was improperly denied a vote on the motion for the resolution; or\n(b) was not given due notice of the item of business pursuant to which the\nresolution was passed, the Board may order that the resolution be treated as a\nnullity on and from the date of the order.\n(2) An application for an order under subsection (1) may not be made after2l\ndays after the date of the meeting at which the resolution was passed.\n(3) Where -\n(a) an order under subsection (1) is made in respect of a resolution making a by-\nlaw amending, adding to or repealing another by-law; and\n(b) the by-law made pursuant to that resolution is in force,\nthe by-law shall, subject to its having been or being amended, added to or\nrepealed under section 32, 33 or 82, as the case may be, have force and effect on\nand from the date the order is so made to the same extent as it would have had if\nthe resolution had not been passed.\nSTB 8 OF 2OIO - WOODGROVE CONDOMINIUM 1la\n25. At the corrmencement of the hearing that was fixed on 23107110, the Board\ninformed the parties that the Board was not a court of law and was established ro\nadjudicate disputes between subsidiary proprietors and the management corporation and\nbetween one subsidiary proprietor and another 12nd Minister for Law Third Reading of\nthe Land Titles (Strata) (Amendment) Bill on the 28107187) and the orders that the Board\ncould make are listed in SS 101 to 1 15 of the Act. It appeared from the Applicants list of\nissues that the Applicants wanted the Board to make ruling/detenninations that were not\nwithin the ambit of SS 103 and 104 of the Act and the Board then asked counsel for the\nApplicants to draft the exact order or orders that the Applicants wanted the Board to\nmake (- when filing an application for an order by a Strata Titles Board, an applicant is\nrequired to state the exact terms of the order that the applicant wants - Form 9). Mr\nGopinath Pillai who was the acting for the Applicants then produced a draft and it was\nnoted that the orders sought were not in line with application filed. Mr Gopinath Pillai\nthen applied for an adjoumemt and informed that he would on behalf of the Applicants be\nfiling an application to amend the application in STB No 812010. There were no\nobjections to the application for the adjournment and directions were then given with\nregard to timelines for the application for amendment and objections if any. The case was\nthen adjourned to the 12108110 for directions in connection with the continued hearing of\nthe case.\n26. On the 12108110 Mr Henry Heng from Ms Tan Peng Chin LLC appeared and\ninformed that he was now acting for the Applicants in place of Mr Gopinath Pillai who\nhad since left Ms Tan Peng Chin LLC. He inter alia requested for a fhrther adjournment\nto make the necessary amendments to the application. Directions were then given in\nconnection with the amendments and the matter was fixed for fuither hearing on the\n031091t0.\n27. At the commencement of the hearing on the 03109110 counsel for the Applicants\napplied to amend the application. lnter alia the orders sought were reframed as follows:\na. That the election of the Council held at the AGM on 5'h\nSeptember 2009 and as declared by the Chairman at\nthe adjourned AGM on the 24'h October 2009 be\ninvalidated.\nb. That the resolutions/declarations by the Chairman\nduring the adjourned AGM removing and disqualfying\nMr Edward Meow be invalidated.\nu.That the results of tlte I't count of the voting done at the\nAGM held on rhe 5'n September 2009 be adoptedfor the\neiection o1 the Councii (iess the 2 irreguiar proxy votes.\nSTB 8 OF 2O1O - WOODGROVE CONDOMINIUM 12a\nLearned counsel for the Applicants, Mr Adrian Tan following the Board's\nquery as to whether there was any provision in the Act for the Board to make\nthe order in (c) above withdrew the application in connection with (c) above.\nCounsel for the Respondents objected to the application for amendment.\n28. The Board was of the view that the proposed amendments, which was really\nnothing more than a clarification of the orders that the applicant were seeking when the\napplication was filed, would not cause any prejudice to the Respondents. The application\nfor amendment was allowed.\n29. The Board considered the submissions of the Applicants and the Respondents.\nDecision of the Board\n30. The application for an order that the election of the council members who were\ndeclared to be elected as a result of the 2nd Result to be invalidated.\n31. S 103 of the Act provides that the Board may invalidate an election where\nprovisions of the Act have not been complied with.\n32- From the submissions of the Applicant it was the case for the Applicants that the\nprovisions of the Act had not been complied with because the votes of proxy holders (28\nvotes) were improperly deducted in connection with the election of the council members\nand the subsidiary proprietors who had given the proxies had unconstitutionally been\ndenied their rights to vote.\n33. Even where there has been noncompliance the Board can refuse to invalidate an\nelection unless the non compliance had prejudicially affected any person and compliance\nwould have affected the result of the election.\n34. In connection with prejudice counsel submitted that the nominees who would\nhave been elected had the votes ofthe proxy holders been counted had lost out because of\nthe deduction ofthe proxy votes.\nSTB 8 OF 2OIO - WOODGROVE CONDOMINIUM 13a\n35. It was noted from the minutes of the meeting on the 24110109 that when the\nchairman announced that he could not accept the results of the ltt Result because of\nirregularities discovered when the votes were checked and declared the election based on\nthe 2\"d Result to be valid, there were no objections raised and this was unanimously\nsupported ie the proxy holders whose votes were not being counted did not raise any\nobjections and more importantly, the nominees who would have been elected if the\nresults of the I't Result was adopted did not object .\n36. It was accordingly the finding of the Board that no one had been prejudicially\naffected and compliance would not have affected the result of the election.\n37. The application for the invalidation of the resolutior/declaration removing and\ndisqualiffing Mr Edward Meow.\n38. The basis of this application was that there was non compliance with the\nprovisions of the Act. Counsel for the applicants submitted that this was not on the\nagenda of the meeting before it was adjourned and therefore should not have been dealt\nwith. He referred to paragraphs 1 and 12 of the l't Schedule to the Act which inter alia\nprovided that motions cannot be submitted at a general meeting unless a notice had been\ngiven in accordance with paragraph 1(2) of the l't Schedule.\n39. It is a fact that the matter of Mr Edward Meow's disqualification was not on the\nagenda of the 1't or adjourned meeting. It is however not unusual for motions to arise\nspontaneously at business meetings. In this case it arose at the adjourned meeting because\nof matters uncovered since the meeting was adjoumed on the 05109109.\n40. The minutes of the meeting on the 24110109 record that during the meeting there\nwas a qugry as to why 2 votes from Edward Meow was being deducted from the results\nof the 2no Result. The meeting was informed that Mr Edward Meow was not registered as\na proxy holder but had cast and signed for 3 votes ie one for himself and two others as a\nproxy holder. When the motion was made for Mr Meow to be disqualified from holding\noffice as a council member because of this irregularity, 5 objections (out of 39 present)\nwere registered and Mr Meow complained about the authority of the MA in checking the\nvotes that led to the discovery of the irregularity. Mr Meow was asked if he was\nsuggesting that his signature had been forged on the voting slips ie that it was not he who\nhad cast the 3 votes. Mr Meow chose not to reply and it was after Mr Meow had chosen\nnot to reply that the motion for his removal and disqualification was carried.\nSTB 8 OF 2OIO _ WOODGROVE CONDOMINIUM t4fI\n41. It was accordingly the finding of the Board that compliance with the provisions of\nthe Act would not have affected the removal and disqualification of Mr Edward Meow.\n42.

This proceeding concerns the validity of the election of council members at the 25th\nAnnual General Meeting of the Mun Hean Building (Building) that was held on 4 November\n2009.\n2. The material facts before the Board are not disputed. It will not deal with the squabbles\nthat were raised in the course of the hearing which have no relevance to the issue for\ndetermination.\n3. The Building consists of 2 blocks of 19 strata units. There were 19 subsidiary proprietors,\nsome of which held more share value than others. For many years, peace prevailed in\nBuilding. No one bothered to stand for elections to form the Management Council and for\nmany years members had to be co-opted to serve on the Management Council.\n4. One day, owing to some differences amongst the subsidiary proprietors in200812009,\ninterests in running the Building was finally stirred. The differences resulted in 2 opposing\ncamps. Now subsidiary proprietors seek to be on the Management Council and began to take\nan interest in the election. They now began to exercise their voting rights. But, after many\nyears of not conducting a contested election, much less attended one, it appeared that the\nsubsidiary proprietors and the managing agent were at a loss as to how to conduct one. They\nsorely lacked practice in his field.\n5. At the 25th Annual General Meeting held 5 October 2009,the meeting was adjourned so\nthat the Respondents could seek advice on issues concerning the conduct of the election of\nthe Management Council. They accordingly sought legal advice from 2 lawyers, which\nadvice were not, directly relevant to the issue before the Board. Yet despite this, things went\nwrong at the election.\n2 STB 7] OF 2OO9 - MLN HEAN BUILDING6. At the resumed 25th Annual General Meeting on 4 November 2009, they proceeded with\nthe election of the Management Council. What transpired in this election led to the present\ndespute. At that election, Mun Hean Singapore Pte Ltd, exceeded the number of nominees\nfor election that they were entitled to under the Building Maintenance and Strata Act - they\nhad 2 nominees put up for elections, when they were entitled to only one nominee , and both\nwere in fact voted in.\n7. On the very same day almost immediately after the election the mistake was discovered\nand one of Mun Hean Singapore Pte Ltd's nominees who was elected resigned in the hope of\nrectifuing the defect in the election. His resignation effectively brought the number of Mun\nHean Singapore Pte Ltd nominee of the Management Council to 1.\n8. The Board was informed that this error was accidental in nature. The number of\nnominees that Mun Hean Singapore Pte Ltd was entitled to have was dependent on the\nnumber of seats to be filled. If 9 seats were up for elections, they were entitled to have 2\nnominees. If less than 9 seats were to be filled, they were entitled to only 1 nominee.\n9. As stated earlier these relevant material facts are not disputed.\nDecisions\ni0. The Board has to decide whether this defect is illegal and incurable by the almost\nimmediate resignation of the extra nominee.\n1 l. The Board accepts the Respondent submission that the wrongful election of a council\nmember cannot invalidate the election of all the rest of the council members. We are mindful\nof the provision of Section 53 of the Act concerning the eligibility of persons for election as a\nmember of the council. We are also mindful of the fact that Section 53 of the Act states that\nthe Board shall not make an order invaliding an election unless it considers the failure to\ncomply with the provision of the Act prejudicially affects any person.\n12. There is nothing before us that could lead to conclude that the nomination of the2\ncandidates from Mun Hean Singapore Pte Ltd was done in bad faith. Neither do we see any\nprejudice to any person by the resignation of the extra nominee from Mun Hean Singapore\nsrB 7i oF 2oo9 - MtrN HEAN BLIILDING 3Pte Ltd once the error was discovered. In our mind, the error was due to inadvertence and the\nelection itself and the election of the other candidates should not be invalidated. With more\nelections likely to be contested in the future they would be sufficiently practiced in the art of\nelectioneering and avoid this kind of unnecessary pitfall.\n13. The application is dismissed with cost fixed at $20,000.00 to be paid by the Applicants to\nthe Respondents.\nDated this 17th day of September 2010\nMr Alfonso Ang\nDeputy President\nStrata Titles Boards\nMr Raymond Lye\nMember\nStrata Titles Boards\nMr Lim Boon Cheng\nMember\nStrata Titles Boards\n4STB 73 OF 2OO9 - MUN HEAN BUILDING"

(Kenneth Tan Partnership) for the First \nRespondent \nGROUNDS OF DECISION \n1. In this application, the Applicant sought from the Board 7 wide-ranging orders for\nthe Respondents to, among other things, make available to him all documents that are in\ntheir custody pursuant to section 113 of the Building Maintenance and Strata\nManagement Act (\u201cBMSMA\u201d).2 2. The Applicant is the subsidiary proprietor of a penthouse unit in Yong An Park\nwhile the 1st Respondent is the management corporation and the 2nd Respondent is the\nmanaging agent of Yong An Park.\n3. On the first day of the hearing, the 1st Respondent confirmed that the 2nd\nRespondent was acting under the directions of the 1st Respondent on the matters\nconcerned and had not been delegated any powers pursuant to section 67 of the BMSMA.\nFollowing that, the Applicant\u2019s application against the 2nd Respondent was withdrawn\nwithout any objections from the parties and with no order as to costs.\nFacts \n4. The Applicant has a number of differences with the 1st Respondent. Just to\nmention two: one concerned its refusal to approve his proposal to carry out alterations\nand additions to enclose the roof terrace of his penthouse and another involved certain\nalterations and additions made by the Applicant without the approval of the 1st\nRespondent.\n5. Using the right given to him under section 47(1) of the BMSMA, the Applicant\nmade a number of applications to inspect a wide range of documents including minutes of\ncouncil and sub-committee meetings of the management corporation and correspondence\nbetween 1st Respondent and its lawyers. Suffice to say, the Applicant was not given\nprompt and complete access to inspect all the documents requested and it resulted in him\nsending repeated reminders and eventually filing this application against the Respondents.\n6. Despite two attempts at mediation by the Board, the parties could not reach any\nsettlement and the matter proceeded for hearing. During the cross examination of the\nApplicant on the first day of the hearing, the 1st Respondent\u2019s counsel mentioned that the\n1st Respondent had sent a letter dated 5 March 2010 (the last working day before the\nhearing) informing the Applicant that he may inspect all the documents requested save\nfor a few documents for which legal professional privilege was being claimed.  The\nApplicant had not yet received this letter but in view of this and following a suggestion of\nthe Board, the Applicant and the 1st Respondent were able to subsequently agree that the\nBoard need only determine whether to order the inspection of the 4 remaining items in\ndispute.\n7. These were:\n(a)The redacted portion of the Council minutes of the 4th Council Meeting held on 15 \nSeptember 2009;\n(b)The redacted portion of the Council minutes of the 5th Council Meeting held on 27 \nOctober 2009;\n(c)The redacted portion of the recommendations of the Legal Sub Committee referred to \nin the draft council minutes of  the 3rd Council Meeting held on 21 July 2009; and\n(d)The legal advice given to the MCST by its lawyers on the MCST\u2019s claims/potential  \nclaims against Ponda (of 333 #XXX), Karim (of 329 #XXX) and Yap (of 327 \n#XXX). 3  \n8. The hearing was then adjourned to 26 April 2010 t o enable the Applicant and 1st \nRespondent to submit their written arguments and address the Board on their submissions. \nAlthough the Applicant, in paragraph 34 of the Applicant\u2019s Reply to 1st Respondent\u2019s \nSubmission, said the Applicant never withdrew any o f the original orders sought by the \nApplicant, the Applicant conceded during his oral submission that he had agreed that the \nBoard need only determine the 4 remaining items in paragraph 7 above. Therefore, the \nhearing proceeded on that basis.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s Arguments  \n \n9. The Applicant acknowledged that the law provides for legal professional privilege. \nHowever, he maintained that the 1st Respondent was not entitled to claim legal \nprofessional privilege.  \n \n10 The Applicant relied on a literal interpretation of  section 47(1) of the BMSMA. \nThe section required the management corporation, upon the written application of a \nlimited category of persons including a subsidiary proprietor, to make available for \ninspection, among other things, all minutes of the council and \u201cany other record or \ndocument in the custody or under the control of the management corporation\u201d. This \nwould cover all the 4 documents for which the 1st Respondent was claiming legal \nprofessional privilege.  \n \n11. The Applicant also referred to the case of Re The Estoril (Strata Titles Plan No. \n843) [1991] SGSTB 3 (\u201c The Estoril \u201d) where the Board there was of the view that the \nMCST there was obliged to disclose the entire minutes, including a redacted portion that \nwas the subject of a claim of legal profes sional privilege, under an equivalent inspection \nprovision of the law.  \n \n12.  In addition, the Applicant relied on paragraph 199 of the Court of Appeal\u2019s \ndecision in Ng Eng Ghee and others v Mamata Kaplidev Dev and others (Horizon \nPartners Pte Ltd, interven er) and another appeal  [2009] 3 SLR 109 (the \u201c Horizon \nTowers case \u201d) to support his contention that the management corporation is not entitled \nto claim legal professional privilege against a subsidiary proprietor.  \n \n13.  The Applicant also argued that the 1st Respondent had failed to show that any of \nthe documents concerned were protected by litigation privilege because the 1st \nRespondent\u2019s litigation against one Ponda was settled and there was also no pending or \ncontemplated litigation against one Karim or t he Applicant.  \n \nRespondent\u2019s Arguments  \n \n14. Counsel for the 1st Respondent argued that the 1st Respondent was entitled to legal \nprofessional privilege in respect of the 4 remaining items because it is a substantive right \nthat may be asserted in answer to an y demand for documents and the right is not \nrestricted to legal proceedings.   4  \n15. The 1st Respondent\u2019s counsel also argued that in accordance with section 9A of \nthe Interpretation Act, section 47(1)(b) of the BMSMA had to be given an interpretation \nthat wo uld promote the underlying purpose or object of the BMSMA. He argued that it \ncould not have been intended that, in providing for a management corporation to maintain \nand manage the common property, the BMSMA would also at the same time have \nintended to imp ede the management corporation\u2019s ability to obtain  good legal advice by \ndepriving it of the protection of legal professional privilege. He also submitted that is \nsettled law that clear words are required to override legal professional privilege and those \nare absent from the BMSMA.  \n \n16. Counsel for the 1st Respondent then submitted that legal advice privilege and \nlitigation privilege are but inextricable aspects of legal professional privilege as a whole \nand it could not have been the intention behind the BM SMA and it is also not rational to \nslice up integral parts of legal professional privilege so as to allow the management \ncorporation to rely on one related part of the privilege but not the other.  \n \n17. The 1st Respondent\u2019s counsel distinguished the Horizon  Towers case  by \ncontending that it addressed an entirely different situation relating to the onerous duties \nof a sale committee in a collective sale, which duties are  akin to a trustee with a power of \nsale. \n \n18. Counsel for the 1st Respondent also submitte d that to the extent that the decision \nof The Estoril  suggested that Council minutes should be capable of being inspected as a \nwhole and without redaction, it should be confined to its specific facts. He argued that it \ndealt with a different situation and with a subsidiary proprietor who was also a council \nmember of the management corporation.  \n \nBoard\u2019s Decision  \n \n19. The Board has considered the matter and is of the view that legal professional \nprivilege is an important legal right and clear words or a neces sary implication are \nrequired in order to abrogate it. As acknowledged by the Court of Appeal in \nSkandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB (Publ), Singapore Branch v Asia Pacific Breweries \n(Singapore) Pte Ltd and other appeals  [2007] 2 SLR (R) 367; [2007] at 43 to 46, legal \nprofessional privilege comprises two forms that may sometimes overlap and legal advice \nprivilege existed regardless of whether litigation is contemplated.  \n \n20. The Board agrees with counsel for the 1st Respondent that in the case of section \n47(1) (b) of the BMSMA, there are no clear words restricting the application of legal \nprofessional privilege. In addition, Parliament could not have intended to impede the \nmanagement corporation\u2019s ability to obtain good legal advice by depriving it of the \nprotec tion of legal professional privilege, while at the same time in section 29 providing \nfor the management corporation to maintain and manage the common property.  \n 5 21. In the Board\u2019s view Horizon Towers case may be distinguished. In a collective  \nsale as in the  Horizon Towers case, the sale committee may not claim legal professional \nprivilege as against the minority subsidiary proprietors, since they act on behalf of all the \nsubsidiary proprietors regardless of whether they are in the majority or minority. The \nBoard agrees with counsel for the 1st Respondent that the present case deals with a \ndifferent situation. This case concerns the management corporation in the exercise of its \nordinary functions of managing the development and the common property rather than a \nsale committee in a collective sale of an entire development.\n22. The Board also agrees with counsel for the 1st Respondent that the case of The \nEstoril should be confined to its specific facts. In addition, the case was decided before \nsection 9A of the Interpretation Act became law and therefore decided under different  \ncircumstances.\n23. Accordingly the Board agrees with the 1st Respondent that items (a) the redacted  \nportion of the Council minutes of the 4th Council Meeting held on 15 September 2009  in \nparagraph 7 above and (d) the legal advice given to the MCST by its lawyers on the \nMCST\u2019s claims/potential claims against Ponda (of 333 #XXX), Karim (of 329 #XXX ) \nand Yap (of 327 #XXX) in paragraph 7 above are entitled to legal advice privilege.\n24. However, the Board disagrees with the 1st Respondent that all the remaining items \nin dispute are entitled to be protected by legal professional privilege.\n25. The Board is of the view that item (b) in paragraph 7 above (or the redacted  \nportion of the Council minutes of the 5th Council Meeting held on 27 October 2009) is \nnot entitled to be protected by legal professional privilege because it merely reports \ninformation and records an instruction to the managing agent. Neither does it constitute  \nlegal advice or reproduces or otherwise reveals information or advice between the 1st \nRespondent and its lawyer.\n26. For the same reasons, the Board is of the view that substantially the whole of item\n(c) of paragraph 7 above (i.e. paragraphs (ii) and (iii) of the redacted portion of the\nrecommendations of the Legal Sub Committee referred to in the draft council minutes of\nthe 3rd Council Meeting held on 21 July 2009 with the exception of the 8 words after \"not\nto further pursue the legal suit with Mr Ponda\" in paragraph (ii)) is also not entitled to be\nprotected by legal professional privilege.\n27. Accordingly, the Board orders the 1st Respondent disclose to the Applicant the\nfollowing:\n(a) the redacted portion of the Council minutes of the 5th Council Meeting held on 27\nOctober 2009; and\n(b) paragraphs (ii) and (iii) of the redacted portion of the recommendations of the Legal\nSub Committee referred to in the draft council minutes of  the 3rd Council Meeting\nheld on 21 July 2009 with the exception of the 8 words after \"not to further pursue the\nlegal suit with Mr Ponda\" in paragraph (ii).6 Legal Costs \n28. On the issue of costs, after taking into account all the circumstances, the Board is\nof the view that parties should bear their own costs in the matter.\nDated this 10th day of June, 2010. \nMR TAN LIAN KER \nPresident \nStrata Titles Board \nMRS TAN SOOK YEE \nMember \nStrata Titles Board \nMR RICHARD TAN MING KIRK \nMember  \nStrata Titles Board "

The Applicants, Alex Chan Kheng Chua and Yeo Suan Neo Wendy are the subsidiary \nproprietors of Blk 297 Bedok South Ave 3, #XXX Bedok Court (the premises) and the \nRespondent, Ong Puay Liew is the subsidiary proprietor of Blk 297 Bedok South Ave 3, # \nXXX Bedok Court. The Applicants\u2019 premises is situated immediately below the Respondent\u2019s.\n2. Since sometime in March 2005, the Applicants noticed stains on the false ceiling of \ntheir premises. The stains were noted in the living room, kitchen, yard area, bedrooms No.1 \nand 2 and the bathrooms.STB 17 of 2009 \u2013 BEDOK COURT 23. After unsuccessful attempts had been made to resolve the matter with the Respondent,\nthe Applicants filed this application and sought the following orders against the Respondent:-\n \u201crectify interfloor water seepage and make good all damages\u2026Also charges involved \nin the filing with STB and any professional fees, legal fees incurred\u2026.\u201d \n4. The parties appeared before the Board and attempts were made to resolve the matter.\nMediation was not successful.\nTHE EVIDENCE \n5. In the course of mediation, the Respondent had engaged M/s CC Building Surveyors\nin connection with the interfloor leakage. In his report, Mr Crispin Casimir of M/s CC\nBuilding Surveyors, in connection with the Applicants\u2019 premises, inter alia reported as\nfollows:-\n5.1 Entrance patio area  \u2013 slight moisture staining on the false ceiling below \nupper unit\u2019s walkway (possibly due to defect in common property side wall - \nthere was a significant horizontal crack there) \n(at Respondent\u2019s unit at this area there was evidence of water seeping out from \nunderneath the tiling into the adjacent floor trap \u2013 indication of trapped water \nbelow the tiling - para 3.2 of report. Mr Crispin Casimir also reported that \nRespondent\u2019s main patio which was directly over Applicants\u2019 dining and \nseating area, the waterproofing was of questionable quality- tile skirting at one \nof the column was partially detached. The water proofing here was inadequate \nand incomplete) \n5.2 Living room  - one of the corners \u2013 corrosion around the light fitting (rain \nwater trapped at the patio above was seeping down to the unit below) \n5.3 Kitchen  - staining at the ceiling at the door head and adjacent ceiling \n5.4 Yard  (outside the bathroom) - substantial staining at the soffit - active dripping \nof water (patio directly above ie respondent\u2019s unit, in relatively poor condition) \n5.5 Bedroom 1  \u2013 staining (photo shows blistering rather than staining) at the \nceiling adjacent to central corridor. Immediately outside the bedroom at the \nceiling at the corridor there was moisture staining  \n5.6 Bedroom 2  \u2013 moisture staining at the ceiling adjacent to the corridor. \n5.7 Master Bedroom  - slight staining on ceiling (possibly due to moisture from \nbathroom area) \n5.8 Common bathroom  \u2013 staining at the ceiling. \n6. Mr Crispin Casimir\u2019s conclusion after the inspection was as follows:-\n\u201cThe overall summary was that there were two sources of leakage, being either from\nthe tiled patio area at the twelfth floor unit or via the common property external walls.\nBoth sources of leakage had to be rectified, concurrently, if the egress into the lower\nunit was to be rectified.\u201d\n7. A copy of Mr Crispin Casimir\u2019s report was forwarded to the MCST and the Applicants\nwere on the 9th of October 2009 informed by the Managing Agent that rectification\nworks in connection with the external walls had been completed.STB 17 of 2009 \u2013 BEDOK COURT 38. It was the evidence of Alex Chan Kheng Chua that despite the works done by the\nMCST \u201c\u2026 there has been no respite from the water seepage \u2026\u201d As at the date of the\nhearing of the Applicants, it was the evidence of Alex Chan Kheng Chua that the\nleakage has not stopped.\n9. M/s Andes Appraisal Pte Ltd (AAP) was engaged by the Respondent after mediation\nhad failed to resolve the dispute and Mr Tong Kum Fei of AAP after inspecting the\nApplicants\u2019 and Respondent\u2019s premises submitted a report dated the 20th of January\n2010 wherein he detailed the defects that he saw. His report with regard to locations of\nevidence of water seepage whilst not exactly on all fours with that noted by Mr Crispin\nCasimir was generally not inconsistent with Mr Crispin Casimir\u2019s.\nHe inter alia reported that:-\n\u201c..... there was no clear symptom of failure at different levels of water proofing \nsystem.....\u201d \n\u201c.....obvious that the symptoms of water seepage from the roof slab had not progressed \nfor the last 24 months\u201d \n\u201c.....water- related defects like blistering and staining are not active or growing in \nterms of severity and extensiveness.....\u201d \n10. Mr Tong Kam Fei\u2019s conclusion was as follows:-\n\u201c\u2026 the cause of water seepage at (respondent\u2019s premises) cannot be accurately\ndiagnosed without further testing of the three layers of water proofing namely  the\nexposed top or side surface, water  proofing system, and the concrete slab itself .\u201d\nInter alia he recommended that a water ponding test be done to check on the integrity\nof the waterproofing.\n11. Following Mr Tong Kam Fei\u2019s inspection, Mr Kenneth Jones, a building surveyor\nwith M/s Robinson Jones Associates Pte Ltd inspected the premises of the Applicants\nand Respondent on the 9th of December 2009. Mr Kenneth Jones\u2019 findings were\ngenerally not inconsistent with Mr Crispin Casimir\u2019s. Inter alia he reported that water\nwas dripping from head of window  opening in living room area even when there had\nnot been any rain within the 12 hours preceding his inspection and agreed with Mr\nCrispin Casimir that this could be attributed to failure of water proofing system at\nRespondent\u2019s roof terrace; the stain in the kitchen noted by Mr Crispin Casimir had\nclearly worsened between Mr Crispin Casimir\u2019s inspection and his inspection; in the\nyard area there was active dripping of water and the source was either rainwater or\nfrom the watering of plants trapped below the (Respondent\u2019s) waterproof membrane.\n12. Mr Kenneth Jones also reported on some additional defects which had not been noted\nby Mr Crispin Casimir.\n13. Mr Kenneth Jones conclusion was that the water proofing system at Respondent\u2019s roof\nterrace has failed.\n14. Recommendations were made by Mr Kenneth Jones with regard to work that had to be\ndone to rectify the defective waterproofing at the Respondent\u2019 premises and with\nregard to repairs that had to be done in the Applicants\u2019 premises. He estimated the cost\nto be approximately $7000.STB 17 of 2009 \u2013 BEDOK COURT 415. From the evidence in the AEICs of the Respondent and her husband they accepted that \n\u201cas the owner of the unit above that of the Applicants (it was the Respondent\u2019s) duty \nand responsibility to make good any seepage or leakage of water from our unit to that \nof the Applicants.\u201d\n16. Whilst it was their wish to eradicate the problem once and for all, they said that they \nhad been advised by professionals (M/s AAP) to \u201clocate the precise cause and origins \nof the problem.\u201d They asked for leave for their expert to conduct the necessary test and \nsaid that they would thereafter get down to carrying out the rectification works.\n17. Other than submitting their AEICs for the purposes of the arbitration hearing, the \nRespondent and her husband chose not to give any oral evidence. Mr Ron Mahabir, the \nson in law of the Respondent, gave oral evidence which was not of any assistance to \nthe Board.\n18. A water ponding test was carried out by Mr Tong Kam Fei on the 23rd and 24th of \nFebruary 2010. The Respondent did not submit any report with regard to the results of \nthe test. There was however evidence from Mr Kenneth Jones that although the tests \nhad generally complied with BCA guidelines, the results of the test (which did not \nconfirm that the leakage responsible for the damage to the Applicants\u2019 premises is not \nfrom the roof terrace of the Respondent\u2019s unit of #XXX ) had been compromised as \ninter alia: the rainwater outlet had been plugged by covering the outlet with sealant; \ngaps between the tiles at the junction of the floor and walls had been sealed with grey \nsealant. A white sealant had also been applied to the surface of the tile joints at \nlocalized location\u2026; Mr Tong Kam Fei who had originally agreed to use an \nincandescent tracer dye did not do so, as the Respondent had objected to this, and \ninstead used a \u201cweak solution of blue coloured dye\u201d which was not appropriate or \neffective in tracing leaks where the water passes through cracks in the concrete.\n19. It was the evidence of Mr Kenneth Jones that \u201cthe visible evidence on site is adequate \nto confirm that the waterproofing system to the roof terrace to unit #XXX  has failed. \nThere can be no doubt as to the need to replace the water proofing system to the roof \nterrace.\u201d\n20. The Respondent submitted a report from Mr Tong Kam Fei dated the 17th of March \n2010 wherein he disagreed with Mr Kenneth Jones\u2019 comments that the results had been \ncompromised. Inter alia he (Mr Tong Kam Fei) did not dispute that the Respondent had \ncarried out some work at the affected area before the tests, which he described as \n\u201cmaintenance work\u201d. He said that he did not advise the Respondent in connection with \nthis work.\nDECISION/ ORDER \n21. After considering all of the above, the Board accepts the findings and the conclusions\nof Mr Crispin Casimir and Mr Kenneth Jones. Accordingly it is ordered as follows:-\na) The Respondent shall engage a contractor to carry out effective and proper repair\nto all the leakages to the Applicants\u2019 unit.\nb) In relation to (a) above, the Respondent shall within 5 days, engage and pay Mr.\nKenneth Jones of Robinson Jones & Associates Pte Ltd or any other mutuallySTB 17 of 2009 \u2013 BEDOK COURT 5acceptable professional engineer / architect / building surveyor (\u201cthe \nProfessional\u201d) to:- \n(i) carry out an inspection of the water seepage into the Applicants\u2019 unit,\nwith a view towards establishing the cause thereof;\n(ii) to identify and define the scope of remedial works to rectify the water\nseepage (\u201cthe Works\u201d) in both the Applicants\u2019 and the Respondent\u2019s\nunits;\n(iii) To prepare a report for the perusal of the Applicants and the\nRespondent, which report and recommendations the Applicants and\nthe Respondent agree to abide by;\n(iv) To recommend to the Respondent an experienced contractor to carry\nout the Works;\n(v) To supervise the execution of, and certify the completion of the Works\nand to inform both the Applicants on completion of the Works;\nc) The Respondent shall provide the Professional with a copy of this Order within\n14 days hereof.\nd) The Respondent shall employ and pay the recommended Contractor to execute\nand complete the Works under the direction and supervision of the Professional.\ne) The Respondent shall ensure that the Works are completed within two months of\nthe Order herein.\nf) In the event the Respondent fails to fully comply with any of the terms of this\nOrder, the Applicants may proceed to take all reasonable steps to give effect to\nthe same, and recover all costs incurred as a debt from the Respondent.\ng) The Respondent shall pay the Applicants damages to be determined.\nh) The Respondent shall pay the Applicants the costs and disbursements of these\nproceedings, to be determined.\ni) Hearing on damages, costs and disbursements be fixed on 22 April 2010 at\n9:30am.\nDated this 1st day of April 2010 \n MR REMEDIOS F.G \nDeputy President \nMR LEE COO \nMember MR TANG TUCK KIM  \nMember  "

Shiever (Grays LLC) for the Applicant STB 84 of 2008 \u2013 The 101 2G\nROUNDS OF DECISION \n1. In this application, the Applicant sought from the Board an order that the Respondents \nare to reinstate back to the original state the fa\u00e7ade and exterior of common areas or \nencroachment of common property, which was done without the consent of the Management \nCorporation Strata Title 1432 (\u201cManagement Council\u201d). The changes allegedly affect the \nappearance of the building comprised in the strata title plan in contravention of Section 37 of \nthe Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act (\u201cBMSMA\u201d). If the Respondents fail \nto reinstate, then the Management Council will reinstate at the Respondent\u2019s cost what a \ncontractor will have to reinstate.\n2. The Applicant is represented by the Chairman of the Management Council of The 101 \nBeach Road, Mr Thomas Tan and the Managing Agent, Mr Nair. The First Respondent is the \nowner of unit #XXX at The 101 Beach Road. The Fifth Respondent is the owner of units \n#XXX and #XXX of The 101 Beach Road and units #XXX, #XXX and #XXX  are owned \nby companies under his name. The Sixth Respondent is the owner of unit #XXX  at The \n101 Beach Road. The Seventh Respondent is the owner of units #XXX and #XXX of The \n101 Beach Road. The Eight Respondent is the owner of unit #XXX of The 101 Beach Road. \nThe Ninth Respondent is the owner of unit #XXX  of The 101 Beach Road.\nFacts \n3. The Respondents own units at The 101 Beach Road with various renovations and\nalterations done to them either when they bought them or that they carried out the renovations\non the units themselves between 2001 and 2007. The Respondents or the previous owners of\nunits where applicable had all obtained approval from the Managing Agent of the\nManagement Council, Building & Construction Authority (\u201cBCA\u201d), Urban Redevelopment\nAuthority (\u201cURA\u201d) and the Singapore Civil Defence Force (\u201cSCDF\u201d) prior to carrying out the\nrenovation work.\nIssues to be determined by the Board \n4. The issue to be determined is whether the Respondents had approval to make the\nrenovations and alterations from the Management Council.\nArguments of parties \n5. Counsel for the Applicant argued that the Respondents had not obtained the requisite\napproval from the Management Council for the renovations and alterations which affected the\nappearance of the building such that it was not in keeping with the rest of the building under\nsection 37(4)(a) of BMSMA. The Applicant also argued that the Respondents should not be\nallowed to dictate their own terms and be allowed to do renovations and alterations without\nthe requisite approval. By not getting the requisite approval, this would affect the appearance\nof the Property which is not in keeping with the rest of the building.\n6. The Applicant based their arguments on the grounds that the Respondents had not\nobtained the consent for the renovations and alterations apart from that of the then Managing\nAgent during Tan Fung Chuan\u2019s tenure as the Chairman which does not constitute as approval\nfrom the Management Council.STB 84 of 2008 \u2013 The 101 37. The Respondents argued that permission for all renovation works is by common\npractice to be granted by the Managing Agent, representing the Management Council and that\nit is unreasonable that all renovation works require the approval of the Management Council.\n8. The Respondents argued that all renovation works were done after approval from all\nthe relevant authorities, namely, the Management Council, BCA, the URA and SCDF. They\nargued that Management Council and the Managing Agent had not raised any objections even\nthough they were on-site several times to review the renovation progress and had checked the\nwork upon completion.\n9. The Fifth Respondent argued that the Applicant cannot retract the approvals for the\nrenovation work that were accorded to him in good faith.\n10. The Sixth Respondent argued that the Management Applicant had acted inconsistently\nby not issuing a notice to all Subsidiary Proprietors who had made the alleged changes to the\nfa\u00e7ade and common areas.\n11. The Respondents also argued that the doors of the units are not visible from outside of\nthe building at road level because they are sited along the common corridor within the\nbuilding and set more than 10m from edge of building. The corridor is also mostly blocked by\nbig service ducts, common staircase and lift lobby.\nDecision \n12. The parties acknowledge that renovation works have been done to the various units of \nThe 101 Beach Road. As only the appearance of the fa\u00e7ade was purported to have been \nchanged, the relevant provisions for such renovations are therefore sections 37(3) and (4) of \nthe BMSMA.\n13. At Pages 13, 14, 26 and 32 of the Fifth Respondent\u2019s Affidavit in Reply by Tan Fung \nChuan dated 7 May 2009, the Fifth Respondent had submitted documentary evidence that the \nManaging Agent had acted for and on behalf of the Management Council to approve the \nrenovation of units #XXX , #XXX and #XXX .\n14. At Annex 1 the Sixth Respondent\u2019s Affidavit dated 16 April 2009, the Sixth \nRespondent had submitted documentary evidence that the Managing Agent had acted for and \non behalf of the Management Council to approve the Renovation of units #XXX  and #XXX .\n15. After carefully considering the evidence, the Board found that all the Respondents had \nprior to the commencement of renovation works in their respective units obtained the requisite \napproval from the Managing Agent who had been properly authorised to act for and on behalf \nof the Management Council. It was thus unnecessary contrary to what the Applicant had \ncontended that approval of the Management Council was required.\n16. The Respondents had also shown that they had obtained approval from the relevant \nauthorities as required by the Managing Agent of the Management Council before carrying \nout the renovation and alteration works.\n17. With Reference to paragraph 8 of the Fifth Respondent\u2019s Affidavit dated 16 April \n2009 and paragraph 13 of the Reply Affidavit by the Fifth Respondent dated 7 May 2009, theSTB 84 of 2008 \u2013 The 101 4Board notes that the Applicant had sent invoices to him for reinstatement works that had not \nbeen done to any of his units. Furthermore, these invoices were used at the Annual General \nMeeting of the Management Council to deprive the Fifth Respondent of his voting rights. As \nthere were outstanding amounts owed to the Management Council the Fifth Respondent had \nlost his right to vote. The Sixth Respondent has also cited in paragraph 11 of the Sixth \nRespondent\u2019s Affidavit dated 16 April 2009 that the voting rights of the Respondents could \npotentially be deprived in perpetuity unless the levy imposed on the Respondents are paid for. \nWe agree with the Respondents that the actions of the Applicant in this regard are \nreprehensible and done in bad faith to deprive the Respondents of their right to vote at the \nAnnual General Meeting. \n18. Having carefully considered the application, the evidence and the submissions of the\nparties, in the opinion of the Board, the Applicant have not discharged the burden to prove\nthat the Respondents had not obtained the necessary approval of the Management Council.\n19. Accordingly, the application is dismissed by the Board.\nLegal Costs \n20. The application is dismissed with costs and disbursements to be agreed or taxed.\nDated this 19th day of March 2010 \nMR ALFONSO ANG \nDeputy President \nMR LEE COO \nMember \nMR FRANKIE CHIA \nMember  "

This is an application by a subsidiary proprietor one Jocelyn Lew Geok Lian\nfor orders against two other subsidiary proprietors namely Cosy Housing\nDevelopment Pte Ltd and Tomlinson lnvestment Pte Ltd under sections'101,103\nand 1 13 of the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act.BUILDING IVAINTENANCE AND STRATA MANAGEMENT ACT2The seven orders sought by the Applicant are as follows:-\n(i) An order that the resolution(s) purpoftedly passed at the\nextraordinary general meeting of MCST 1434 on 5 June 2009 (the\n'EPGA') authorising a joint application to the Urban\nRedevelopment Authority by the Respondents and MCST 1434 to\nregularise various sub-division works (th Works,)\nundeftaken by the Respondents, including but not limited to the\nfollowing, be invalidated:\na.

An order that the Respondents and/or its representatives, namely\nMr Tan Tien Chi and/or Mr Jeremy Tan (who are concurrently the\nChairman and Secretary of MCST 1434 respectively) supply to the\nApplicant a copy of the following:\na. the minutes of the EOGM held on 5 June 2009;\n2STB 48 OF 2OO9 _ SOPHIA VILLEb. the purpofted joint application to the Urban Redevelopment\nAuthority by the Respondenfs and MCST 1434 to regularise the\nSubdivision Works; and\nc. all other relevant correspondences and documents relating to\nthe Sub-Division Works which were copied to, or involved\ndirectly or indirectly, MCST 1434.\n(iv) An order that Cosy Housing Development Pte Ltd and/or its\nrepresentative Mr Jeremy Tan indemnify MCST 1434 and/or all\naffected subsidiary proprietors for all claims, /osses and damages\narising from its unauthorised engagement of Starlight Builders Pte\nLtd for works to the common areas of Sophia Ville in contravention\nof the resolution(s) passed at the 14th annual general meeting of\nMCST 1 434 approving the following upgrading works (the\n\"Upqradinq Works\"):\na.

Sometime in May 2008, subdivision and partitioning works were carried out\nby the 1\" & 2n0 Respondents to the units.\n4 Sometime rn December Nicholas Bailey the Applicant's husband wrote to\nURA to inquire the legality of the works being done at the 1st & 2nd Respondents'\nunits.\n5. Sometime in May 2009, the URA suggested that 1't & 2nd Respondents and\nthe MCST submit a joint application to regularize the work which had already been\ncarried out in the 1'' & 2no Respondents units.\n6. At an EOGM held on Srh June 2009, MCST passed a resolution agreeing to\nsubmit a joint application with the 1sI and 2no Respondents.\nThe Preliminarv lssue\n7. A preliminary issue raised before the Board was whether the Board has the\npower or jurisdiction to make an order against a non-party to the proceeding as\nprayed for by the Applicant.\nL The Applicant submitted that from the plain reading of sections 101,'103\nand 113 of the Building Maintenance and Skata Management Act (the Act) it was\nclear that an order could be made against the Management Corporation (MCST)\neven if the same was not a party to an application. The Act did not expressly\nmandate the requirement for the MCST to be a party to any application under\nthose sections.\n4STB 48 OF 2OO9 _ SOPHIA VILLEThe Applicant's Submission9. Alternatively the Applicant submitted that save for prayer 3, all the other\nprayers did not require any positive action from the MCST and therefore no\nnecessity for MCST to be a party to the application.\n10. ln the further alternative, the Applicant submitted the Respondents had\nusurped the role of the MCST by purporting to act on behalf of the MCST in the\nmatter herein and this application was against them as purported agent of the\nMCST. Hence MCST need not be a party.\n11 The Respondents submitted that under section 24 of the Act, MCST is a\n\"body corporate capable of suing and being sued and having perpetual successor\nand a common seal\". lt is a separate and distinct legal entity from the individual\nsubsidiary proprietors.\n12. The resolution which the Applicant sought to invalidate was a resolution\npassed by the MCST and not the resolution of the 1't and 2nd Respondents.\nTherefore the Board has no power or jurisdiction to make an order against the 'l't\nand 2^0 Respondents invalidating the resolution. Such order they submit can only\nbe made against the MCST.\n13. Similarly they submitted that all the other orders sought by the Applicant in\nthe application did not fall within the purview of the Board and/or are sought\nagainst the wrong party.\n14. The Board flnds that if it were to grant the orders sought by the Applicant in\nthe first and second prayers, those orders would affect the MCST i.e invalidating\nits resolution and declaring its joint application with the 1\"tand 2M Respondents to\nURA as unauthorised.\n16. The MCST, Jeremy Tan and Tan Tien Chi are not parties named in the\nproceedings.\n)STB 48 OF 2OO9 _ SOPHIA VILLEThe Respondents' Submission\nBoard's Findinqs\n15. Similarly, orders sought by the Applicant in the third and fourth prayers\nwould affect one Jeremy Tan and one Tan Tien Chi.\n17. ln effect, the Applicant is applying to the Board to issue orders against the\nMCST, Jeremy Tan and Tan Tien Chi without giving them an equal opportunity to\nbe heard.18. The Board is unable to find any section in the Act that confers on it such powers.\nlndeed it would be contrary to the principle of natural justice, i.e the audi alteram partem\nprinciple\n19. The Board is mindlul ot its duty to hear an application even if the application is\ndefective and rule on its merits.\n20. ln this application, not only was it defective, the Board finds that it has no power to\ngrant the orders sought against non-parties to the application. lt would be a lruitless exercise\nto proceed to hear this application on its merits.\n21 . The application is therefore dismissed with cost.\n22. The cost is to be agreed il not it will be assessed at a later date.\nDated this 1 8th day ol February 201 0.\nMr Seng Kwang Boon\nDeputy President\nMr Lee Keh Sai\nIvlember\nMr Goh Tiam Lock\nMember\n6 STB 48 OF 2OO9 _ SOPHIA VILLE"

They are as follows: \nThe Development is a residential development comprised of 3 towers each 24 storeys high, \nand housing some 136 residential units. Each unit within the Development features balcony \nbalustrades made of glass.  \nIn 2008,  there  were  5 separate  instances  of spontaneous  breakages  of the balcony  glass \nbalustrades.  There  were  also several  incidents  of other  spontaneous  glass  breakages \nbetween early 2008 to early 2009.   3 \nAs a result of thes e incidents, and in particular the spontaneous breakages of the balcony \nglass balustrades, the MC engaged a fa\u00e7ade consultant to advise on the matter, with a view \nto considering legal proceedings against the developer of the Condominium, Winworth \nInvestmen t Pte Ltd (\u201cthe Developer\u201d).  \n \n \nThe facade consultant determined that there was a likelihood of further instances of such \nbreakages of glass, and that significant physical injury may result due to the shattered glass \nfalling onto the ground floor and onto t he units immediately below. The fa\u00e7ade consultant \nfurther recommended various measures to be carried out to enhance the safety of the glass \nbalustrades, such as the application of a safety film and installing additional supports. \nShould spontaneous breakag es of the balcony glass balustrades occur, the safety film would \nhold the shattered glass in position, preventing it from falling onto the ground floor and/or \nonto the units immediately below.  \n \nSubsequently, the Developer proposed to carry out rectificati on and/or enhancement works \nto the balcony glass balustrades (\u201cthe Works\u201d). This involved, amongst others, applying a \nsafety film into structures/kerb/frames and installing additional supports to the glass \nbalustrades.  \n \nThe Developer\u2019s proposals were in li ne with the recommendations of the fa\u00e7ade consultant. \nAccordingly, the MC was agreeable to the Developer carrying out the proposed Works, and \nsubsequently issued various circulars and letters to the Respondents to notify them of the \nDeveloper\u2019s proposed co urse of action.  \n \nThe consent of the Respondents was sought to allow the Developer to enter into the Units \nto carry out the Works. Such consent was sought by way of, amongst others, circulars dated \nfrom December 2008 to June 2009.

Therefore, please be informed that per as advice from \nthe solicitor, M/s Drew & Napier LLC, it has stated that unless the strata \ntitle plans othe rwise provide, the balcony glass balustrades are part of the  7 \ncommon property. The MCST therefore has the responsibility of maintaining \nthem and a failure to do so would constitute an offence under Section 9 of \nthe BMSM Act. If, on the other hand, the balco ny glass balustrades are also \npartly owned by the respective subsidiary proprietors, then the individual \nsubsidiary proprietors would also be Liable in the event of a collapse.\u201d  \n \nAlthough several timeframes were provided to the respondents for them to choo se for entry \ninto their units for the execution of the works and although they were informed of the \nprocess by which the work would be carried out, their consents were not given.  \n \nIt is the case for the applicants that the balcony glass balustrade form par t of the common \nproperty which the MC has a duty under S 29(1)(b)(i) of the Building Maintenance and \nStrata Management Act 2004 (the Act) to properly maintain and keep in a state of good and \nserviceable repair; and that further under Rule 2.1.n of the By L aws the MC is entitled to \nenter the units at a reasonable time and upon giving reasonable notice to execute  any work \nor perform any duty in connection with the condominium.  \n \nThe respondents agree that the applicants has a duty under S 29(1)(b)(i) of the A ct to \nproperly maintain the common property of the development but do not agree that the \nbalcony glass balustrades are part of the common property and accordingly are not \nagreeable to allowing the applicants to enter their units for execution of the necess ary \nworks  \n \nS 29(1)(b)(i) of the Act  provides as follows:  \n \n29. - (1) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (3), it shall be the duty of a \nmanagement corporation - \n \n(b) to properly maintain and keep in a state of good and serviceable repair  \n(including , where reasonably necessary, renew or replace the whole or part \nthereof) \u2014  \n \n(i) the common property  \n \nRule 2.1.n of the By Laws provides as follows:  \n \n \u201cResidents shall permit any staff of the Management at all reasonable time and \non reasonable notice being gi ven (except in an emergency when no notice is \nrequired) to enter their unit to execute any work or perform any duty or enforce \nany by -laws and house rules in connection with the condominium.\u201d  \n \nIssue :  \n \nBoth applicants and respondents submitted that the iss ue for determination by the Board \nwas whether the balcony glass balustrades are common property  \n  8 \nIt is the case for the applicants that they are because they are \u201cwindows\u201d and it is the case \nfor the respondents that they are not \u201cwindows\u201d.  \n \n \nIn the interpr etation section of the Act viz S 2(1) a window is defined to include  \n \n\u201c\u2026any other building material which transmits natural light directly from outside a \nbuilding into a room of or interior of the building\u201d  \n \n \nand in S 2(9) of the Act it is provided that a ll windows located on any exterior wall of lot \nother than louvres, casement windows, sliding windows, or windows with any movable \npart, shall be common property , unless otherwise described in a strata title plan . \n \nLouvres, casement windows, sliding windows  and windows with movable parts are \nexcluded from the definition because they are op enable and within the control of unit \nowners themselves and it would be difficult for the MC to supervise or control the proper \nusage and maintenance of such windows. All o ther windows remain as common property \nbecause unit owners cannot be expected to take charge of such external fixed windows as \nthey are outside the unit owners\u2019 purview and control  \n \nThe Submissions:  \n \nIt was the submission of the Respondents that whilst the  glass balustrade at the balcony \ndoes transmit natural light from the outside it does not in this case transmit the light into a \nroom or into the interior of the building. The respondents submitted that in this case the \nlight transmitted through the glass balustrade is transmitted only into the balcony and the \nbalcony according to the respondent is not the interior of the building.  \n \nThe Board\u2019s attention was drawn to the fact that there was no definition in the Act with \nregard to what constituted \u201cthe inte rior of the building\u201d  and it was the submission of the \nrespondents that the balcony is an \u201c exterior feature\u201d.  \n \nS 2(1) of the Act provides for an exterior feature to have the same meaning as that in the \nBuilding control Act Cap 29 and it is defined as follo ws: \n \n\"exterior feature\" , in relation to any building, means any of the following features that is \npermanent and is installed on, forms part of or projects outwards from the roof or exterior \nof the building:  \n(a) any air -conditioning unit, including any wi ndow air -conditioning unit and any  \ncondensing equipment of an air -conditioning unit;  \n(b) any window, with or without movable parts;  \n(c) any grille or shutter, with or without movable parts;  \n(d) any tile, cladding, curtain wall, siding, plaster, bracket  or cornice;  \n(e) any gutter, rainwater down -pipe, or part of the roof;  \n(f) any awning or sun -shading device;  9 \nThe applicants submitted as follows: \nIt is to be observed from the phraseology, that an exterior feature \u201cmeans any of the \nfollowing features\u201d enumerated in the above provision. Legislature has chosen to use such \nterminology, instead of \u201cincludes, but is not limited to the following features\u201d. Thus, it is \nsubmitted that the list above is an exhaustive list of features which are to be considered \nexterior features of a building.  \nAccordingly, a balcony is not considered to be an \u201cexterior feature\u201d of a building under \nSection 2(1) of the Building Control Act, since it is not expressly listed therein.  \nOn the part of the respondents it was submitted that the key words in the definition was \n\u201cpermanent \u201d and \u201c project outwards\u201d and because a balcony is a permanent feature and \nprojects outwards it is an exterior feature. \nThe Decision of the Board \nThe Board cannot agree with the respondent as the definition does not provide that any \nfeature that is permanent and projects outwards to be an exterior feature. It is only the 6 \nfeatures listed from (a) to (f) in the definition that can qualify to be an external feature and \na balcony is not one of the 6 feature s. \nIt is the decision of the Board that a balcony is not an external feature and that the balcony \nglass balustrade which transmits natural light from the outside into the interior of the \nbuilding is, under S 2(1) of the Act a \u201cwindow\u201d The balcony glass ba lustrade is not a \nlouvre, casement window, sliding window, or window with any movable parts and \naccordingly is, under S 2(9) of the Act, common property as it is not otherwise described in \nthe strata title plan. \nAccordingly the Board orders: \n1. That the respondents and/or tenants and/or occupiers of 10 Draycott Park #XXX and 6\nDraycott Park # XXX allow the MC\u2019s agents, staff, employees, contractors and/or  \nnominees to enter the said units, upon receipt of  not less than two weeks notice, to carry \nout rectification and/or enhancement works to the balcony glass balustrades of the units. \nThe respondents will also pay for the costs of the said works ($3500 x 2 = $7000). 10 \n \n \n2. That the Respondents pay to the applicants the costs of this application.   \n \n \n \n  Dated this 14th of January 2010.  \n \n \n \n \n \n        Mr F G Remedios  \n        Deputy President  \n \n \n \n        Prof Teo Keang Sood  \n        Member  \n \n \n \n        Dr Lim Lan Yuan  \n        Member  "
